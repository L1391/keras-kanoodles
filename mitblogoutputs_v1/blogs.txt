things that are golden, part 0 things that are golden, part 1 things that are golden, part 2 (blockprinted ink, 2023): specifically from the tree in front of Walker Memorial the commuter rail has caused me so much anguish this summer, but i’ll defend her until my last breath imagery borrowed from   by John Green the new-ish Fall Out Boy album. tbh I feel so-so about the album as a whole, but I do like the eponymous song, So Much (for) Stardust this summer i’ve been biking to some naturey places in the area, like Middlesex Fells and Walden Pond! text for accessibility: yellow aspen leaves the liminality of public transportation tomatoes ripening on the vine hot poi summer telephone wires fracturing a setting sky so much for stardust warm street lamps long bike rides This iteration of “things that are golden” was inspired by  @cactuscloudart  Council for the Arts at MIT #stay gold

this summer, i’m living in a small, cozy house out in the medieval parish of st ives. it’s a small town that’s around 10 miles outside of Cambridge (the one in the United Kingdom, not in the United States where MIT is located). in fact, it’s so small that it usually appears on the 2nd page of Google when you search it up, way after its more famous homonymous beach city counterpart in Cornwall. you may be wondering why i’m here. i’m doing a

graphene ⁠ 02 graphene is so cool. basically, it's a novel material that is a 1-atom thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. visually, think a carbon atom placed at every intersection of chicken wire. its discovery in 2010 won the nobel prize because of its remarkable properties: it's the most electrically and thermally conductive material ever discovered, 200x stronger than steel, 1000x lighter than paper, and so much more. anyways, i work in development engineering, where we make the stuff discovered by the research team into real things people can use. graphene is also a quite sustainable material, so im especially excited to see how it impacts the environment. i can go on and on about graphene, but i will stop myself and leave you here. it’s quaint tucked away in an abundance of nature yet has a family-sense of liveliness in the streets i biked the town this past weekend, from the top to the bottom (this sounds long, but the town is around the size of a 1 mile square) and saw some really cute things two girls, around 6 years old, were riding around in grocery carts after the shop closed up a few little boys were ripping up grass and throwing it at each other, like some alternative form of tag mixed with nature’s confetti an elderly couple was just exiting an ice cream shop together when i passed them, with ice cream in one hand and each other in the other cute dogs being walked every now and then and it’s not really… missing anything? it just has, like, *one* of everything need a shoe repaired? there’s  the  shoe shop want to dive into some history? there’s  the  town museum looking for a book? there’s  the  library it simplifies life. ive enjoyed the juxtaposition between this peaceful style of living as opposed to the bustling life of mit, and i mean that fully: i like the contrast. it’s not that one draws to me much more than the other, rather, the experience of both makes me appreciate each one more. i think they’re delightful in their own rights. being in st ives has reaffirmed something ive always thought of myself: i love both the rural and city, and want to have both in my life. i dont need to… pick? i feel like that’s a question that’s commonly asked, akin to “what do you want to do with your life,” and i’ve never been able to pick one place. i can see myself living out in the city for work and such because i love the thrill of urban areas, but also frequently camping or maybe

*puts on CMS hat* I LOVE watching media analysis video essays. Whenever I finish a relatively mainstream series (ex. The Owl House, The Hunger Games, Avatar the Last Airbender), I spend hours watching nearly every video essay that exists on Youtube, dissecting the underlying commentary, allegories, plot devices, etc. I emerge with a deeper understanding of the content and a deeper appreciation for the creators. But even if the discussion is on media that I don’t personally consume (ex.  family vloggers the Kardashians Mr. Beast Blahaj, Swedish for “blue shark,” is the cuddly plush that many of us know and love. Blahaj’s wide pink smile is lined with white triangles of felt teeth. Blahaj’s brown eyes are embroidered on, as Blahaj’s retailer Ikea noticed that beaded eyes pose a choking hazard to young children. Blahaj is a meter long, nearly body pillow sized. When you hold Blahaj, Blahaj doesn’t judge, Blahaj simply  understands .  While the adoration of Blahaj is a worldwide phenomenon, the impact of Blahaj on people and communities can be seen and felt right at home. Indeed, Blahaj has recently inserted themselves into many facets of MIT student culture. Blahaj has become a spinning prop for Jonathan ‘25 to perform what’s called a holy trinity, a move usually done with a staff:  this is so impressive holy moly (video courtesy of Jonathan ’25) Blahaj had their own Friday Afternoon Club (FAC) at East Campus last November, where an assortment of shark related snacks were passed out.  Are you a Blahaj enjoyer? Do you have a baby who wants to meet new shork friends? Maybe you just want to see some sharks and eat shark food (shark shaped or for sharks???  )? Come to Blahaj FAC tomorrow at 5 pm in Talbot! Rory ‘24 runs a recurring event called Sharkcuterie at Random Hall that brings Randomites and their Blahajs together to feast on cheese, crackers, and fancy drinks.  blahaj and friends! (photo courtesy of Rory ’24) Blahaj is the unofficially official mascot of MIT Sport Taekwondo. But while Blahaj has achieved local celebrity status by posing in every other East Coast Taekwondo Collegiate League teams’ photos, Blahaj isn’t only there to look pretty. Under the care of club officer Tiffany ’24, Blahaj trains regularly with the team and has become an accomplished martial artist in their own right. Blahaj in sparring gear! photo courtesy of Tiffany ’24 But how did this shark plush get so popular? Blahaj’s rise to Internet and cultural stardom did not happen overnight. Instead, Blahaj has maintained a steady Internet prominence since its release in 2014. While there is always an element of chance to what does and does not go viral, I argue in this blog that Blahaj’s popularity can be contextualized within multiple broader forces of the past decade, such as Internet meme culture, the pandemic, and the protection and dismantling of LGBTQ+ rights. As an unsuspecting symbol of quiet resilience, Blahaj has emerged as the constant source of comfort that the world can hold onto during this period of instability. Early Evolutionary History Reddit users Previous Next Finally, Ikea introduced the Blahaj that we know today in early 2014. Between now and then, Blahaj has only gone through minor revisions like reducing the number of gills from 6 to 5. The blue shark quickly became a staple of the Ikea plush oeuvre, catapulting into Internet memedom and into our hearts.  The Internet Meme  According to  Know Your Meme Since then, many more photos of Blahaj being placed in human-like situations circulated on the Internet. Rory and Tiffany’s Blahaj photos follow this meme format. In 2018, similar Blahaj memes exploded in Russia, whose Ikea locations reported running out of Blahaj’s one hour after restock. this viral photo was taken at a Moscow location in 2018 Blahaj isn’t the first shark in the meme culture canon, but instead continues a legacy established by Left Shark and Baby Shark. One of Katy Perry’s backup dancers during her 2015 Superbowl halftime show performance, colloquially known as Left Shark, went viral for forgetting the choreography. Aside from messing up on national TV, the laughable awkwardness of the situation is magnified by the dazed expression on the shark onesie and the overall silliness of Katy Perry’s beach themed stage set. Then in 2016, the South Korean company Pinkfong released the Baby Shark nursery song. As the Baby Shark challenge went viral first in Indonesia and later other parts of the world, the Baby Shark song skyrocketed in streams to the point where it reached #32 on the Billboard 100.  Previous Next What Left Shark, Baby Shark, and Blahaj have in common is that they all disrupt the norm of how sharks are portrayed in the media. Sharks have a reputation of being vicious killer beasts, thanks to sensationalized reports of shark attacks and the Jaws franchise, a series of films focused on sharks eating innocent beachgoers. However, our three meme sharks are anything but threatening. Left Shark is awkward and silly. Baby Shark is cute and promotes intergenerational family relationships. Blahaj’s listing on Ikea claims that they are “Big and safe to have by your side if you want to discover the world below the surface of the ocean.” The virality of cute shark imagery isn’t surprising when considered in the broader context of memes. We share things that make us feel good, make us laugh, and especially in the case of our three meme sharks, subvert our expectations. But perhaps most important to how and why memes propagate like wildfire, memes foster participatory cultures where basically anyone with Internet access can contribute their own version of a meme. By encouraging people to create and share Blahaj photoshoots, Blahaj’s Internet debut does exactly just that.  Comfort during the Pandemic Google search trends reveal an uptick in searches for Blahaj starting from early 2020, which coincides with the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Especially during early stages of the pandemic when social distancing regulations and quarantines were enforced, many people experienced increased feelings of isolation and despair. People were  touch starved.   If hugging another living thing isn’t possible, the next best thing is hugging a stuffed animal. Blahaj emerged as a popular emotional support plush for its relative accessibility. Blahaj is affordable compared to other plushies of a similar size and is sold by a big box retailer with multiple locations across the US and the world. These two attributes also apply to the Costco Bear, which was popular at a similar magnitude during the pandemic.  Blahaj and the Costco Bear’s pandemic popularity may also be explained by the lipstick effect. This theory states that smaller, less expensive novelty goods (like lipstick) remain popular during economic recessions. While something like a luxury bag might be out of the budget, many consumers can afford lipstick as an indulgent “treat” as a temporary escape from their worries. In other words, “everything’s going to shit, but at least I look hot.” Blahaj plays a similar role where “at least I look hot” becomes “at least I can get a hug from a silly shark.”  While everyone can use Blahaj’s cuddles during these trying times, Blahaj holds special significance for a particular community to the point where Blahaj is without a doubt, an  icon .  The Trans Icon The first picture of Blahaj with a trans flag background surfaced on Reddit in 2020.  In the past decade, Tumblr and to some extent, Reddit have provided safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people to explore their identities, especially for those living in homes or communities where being out may not be safe. These Internet spaces also serve as hubs of information, empowering people with the language to express their sense of self and with knowledge for what transitioning may look like. Naturally, many inside jokes (like the stereotype that lesbians wear carabiners on their belt loops) emerged in these communities. Such inside jokes contribute to the broader culture, as being a part of the inside joke (like choosing to wear a carabiner to subtly signal being fruity) fosters camaraderie. In a world that villainizes LGBTQ+ people through rhetoric, legislation, and violence, building up these strong Internet communities with their own culture and jokes aligns with the idea of  “joy as resistance,” When Blahaj broke into the Tumblr/Reddit scene, trans communities on those platforms quickly latched onto Blahaj.
 Writer Meghan Cherry ⁠ 01 highly recommend reading this for a more personal perspective on the importance of blahaj to the transfeminine community, and for more context on how transfeminine internet communities has shaped meme culture as a whole! It helps that Ikea has a long history of supporting LGBTQ+ rights in its advertising. People prefer to buy from companies that align with their values, or in this case, support their basic rights. In 1994, Ikea released the first mainstream commercial featuring a gay couple. In 2021, Ikea featured Blahaj and Snuttig the polar bear cuddling together in support of a Swiss referendum on same-sex marriage and adoption rights.  Previous Next While Blahaj already kind of shares a color palette with the trans flag with its blue body, pink mouth, and white belly, Ikea Canada donated specially designed Beyou Blahaj plushies to the Halifax Sexual Health Center in 2022.  Blahaj’s wide appeal both within and beyond the trans community may also come from the fact that it’s not marketed towards a specific gender, like many clothing or toys featuring sharks are. Going back to the archetype of the killer shark, sharks are often associated with violent masculinity. As a cute plush, Blahaj defies gender norms and thereby allows many trans people to experience and express gender on their own terms.  A Reddit user Blahaj Loves All no thoughts head empty (photo courtesy of Tiffany ’24) Blahaj may appear to possess not a single thought behind those embroidered eyes. But when we consider just how impactful Blahaj has been on all sorts of communities, Blahaj most certainly contains multitudes. As a catalyst for participatory meme culture, antidote to touch-starvedness, advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, symbol of the Internet trans community, and tireless member of the MIT community, Blahaj is loved by all.  And of course, Blahaj loves all. #blahaj #cms posting #im chronically online

If you are an international student who is coming to MIT this fall, congratulations! You have a lot to be proud about. From experience, I can say that right now, you have a lot to be worried about too. Here is a non-exhaustive list of things you should remember to do this summer. Hopefully, this will make your time easier as you arrive at MIT. 1. Documents I expect that MIT has already sent you your I-20 forms. I also expect that you either have a date for your visa interview soon or have already had your interview. If not, please get on that as soon as possible.  Keep signed copies of your I-20, your letter of admission and proof of funding on you when you travel. You will need them. And of course, your passport.  I only talked about travel-related and international-specific documents but there will be some forms that MIT asks you to fill out by specific deadlines throughout the summer so stay on top of your emails and check the Orientation slack so you don’t miss any of these deadlines. 2. Everything Medical  Stay on top of your medical information card. There can be different requirements for tests and vaccinations for different countries so check those out for your own country and get vaccinated and tested accordingly on time.  If you are using prescription medicines, try to find a doctor who could communicate in English or at least keep the prescription in your native language. Find a
 
PCP ⁠ 01 primary care provider 3. People  Reach out to people who might be able to help you around campus. I got in touch with the Pakistani students at MIT and it helped me a ton. I was able to get advice while choosing a dorm and Ashhad A. ’23 also helped me get from the airport to campus, which I am still very, very grateful for.  In addition to that, also join your class discord and/or other group chats. Because we have somewhat similar experiences, it is easy to just stay in the international student bubble. Although that itself is an incredibly diverse group of people, international students only make about 11 percent of the MIT undergraduate population. So, you don’t want to be missing out on getting to know most of MIT by just staying in that bubble. Joining class group chats can help a lot with that! Compare your local climate to  Boston’s climate ISO website Look into whether your chargers and other electrical devices fit into power sockets and outlets in the US. There are usually two plug types, one with two flat pins or one with two flat pins and a grounding pin. You may also need voltage converters. There is a Target close to campus, where you can buy extension cords and other things you use, but you might still want to pack power adaptors for your phone and other necessary devices for the first couple of days. Another thing that I experienced, which I think should be a relatively isolated occurrence, was that the carrier frequencies used by US network providers were incompatible with
 
my phone ⁠ 02 it was a Huawei 6. Getting to MIT  Make sure to get your flight tickets as soon as you can! You should also look into how you will get from the airport to MIT. MIT ISO has a very helpful video on this linked  here . They might also send more information on this, so check for emails from them. Keep in mind that you will likely have several luggages so plan accordingly. 7. Money  Make sure to convert some money into USD and keep it on you. The airports I was transiting through also accepted dollars, which was useful. Regardless of that, it will be useful to have some money on you before you are in the US so you don’t have to immediately worry about getting it converted from whatever local currency you use.  8. Food Make sure you know what you are doing for food the first couple of weeks before semester starts. If you are arriving right in time for international orientation, you will likely be able to access a dining hall for brunch and dinner. If, for any reason, you are arriving earlier, you will have to sustain yourself until international orientation starts. It would be good if you have a vague idea of what you are doing. For example, you will realize that a lot of things in the US require you to have a debit or credit card. You will need it for your Uber and
 
UberEats ⁠ 03 or other food delivery apps If you are struggling to find food, talk to
 
upperclassmen ⁠ 04 around your dorms, your Residential Peer Mentors or your Orientation Leaders 
actual adults. ⁠ 05 Your Area Director and Graduate Resident Advisor are real adults that you will be interacting with around your dorm. They are also there to help you! here This list is, of course, not perfect and I might have missed things, so be on the look out for emails from the Office of the First Year, Housing & Residential Services, Division of Student Life and the International Students Office. Also, check the Orientation Slack semi-regularly for updates on deadlines and use it to get your questions answered. Your Orientation Leaders are another resource you can use even before you get to campus. (P.S. Shoutout to Eldar U. ’25 for suggesting additions to this list! Also feel free to throw questions in the comments.) #international #international students #iso

i’ve been in a perpetual state of writer’s block recently (i.e. the whole entire school year), so i’m going to set a timer for 25 minutes because that’s when my laundry is supposed to be done and just continuously write for the entire time. every so often i go through a phase where i become furiously obsessed with  monkeytype nitrotype theoretically, if i were typing at full speed for the entire 25 minutes i should end up with like a 3750 word blog, at least i think, i hope i did the math right, i think the awkward thing with me and math is that it’s not necessarily as if i’m bad at math or i hate it but my fundamentals are just really poor. i never learned any tricks on doing mental math (my friends and i had a brief  zetamac that was a tangent !!!! sorry !! ok, so, in a vacuum and
 
assuming no fatigue or pausing to think ⁠ 01 in hindsight this is such an mit way of phrasing things... my friends love saying things are “trivially true” or casually dropping “o(n) time” into a conversation or otherwise treating normal conversation like a proof. nerds !!! anyways this is an exercise i learned while i was at the kenyon review summer writing program or something like that and the idea is that you’re just supposed to follow your stream of consciousness and continuously write for as long as you can in the hopes that you’ll be able to generate new ideas to play off of. i’m pretty sure we weren’t supposed to use any punctuation or line breaks and we were also supposed to write it out by hand so i’m already not quite following the rules, but since i probably won’t be doing any editing after i’m done writing, other than to maybe add in links or pictures, i’m going to try and preserve the legibility of this blog as much as possible with some line breaks here and there. anyways (come on teresa find another transition word please)
 
writing is hard. writing is so freaking hard !!!  ⁠ 02 this is where the meta part comes in! 
i refuse to write “rough drafts” ⁠ 03 even while writing this it pained me a little to write without proper capitalization and grammar in fairness i did give somewhat of a disclaimer when i was applying to be a blogger ! in my application i talked about how i honestly don’t like writing all that much, or at least i find it really difficult, but i did say i would work on that and i guess this is me working on that. so far it has been pretty cathartic to just word vomit so that’s good! writing in this way, entirely unfiltered and loose is similar to the merit i see in writing poetry. i will always gravitate towards writing poetry over writing short stories or essays. it’s just a less rigid art form. if i don’t want to use full sentences or correct grammar or arrange words in an order that makes sense i don’t have to. and i think there’s something special about trying to capture the same meaning or image without using outright prose. i think when you have less words to work with you’re forced to be more particular about each one i think i forget that my blogs don’t have to be some kind of
 
deep and complex piece of art ⁠ 04 i'd say the blogs i've published so far don't achieve this anyway, so i'm not so sure why i beat myself up about this before i even start writing ok i’m kind of losing steam here i don’t know what to write about so i’m going to talk about monkeytype again. so actually my current hyperfixation is monkeytype but on mobile. for people my age it’s much more common to find people who can text on their phone without looking at the keyboard than it is to find people who can type on their computer without looking at their hands. the discrepancy between me and my friends is a lot smaller when it comes to mobile typing speed. actually i was shocked the first time i tried it on mobile because my wpm was like 60 and i was typing as fast as i possibly could, but then i realized that my accuracy was just horrendously low and bringing down my score um, hyperfixations, hyperfixations. so many. yesterday i relapsed into my tetris hyperfixation. i’ve never been as big a tetris fanatic as my friends but i did spend about an hour and a half just playing 40 lines on  tetr.io hyperfixations is a fun word to type – it has a nice flow to it, unlike words with double letters like yellow, or words with too many letters in a row that force me to use my ring fingers, which are probably my least agile fingers. subway surfers is a recurring hyperfixation. pinterest saving sprees is another one. reorganizing my entire spotify playlist setup. saving easy 10-minute no-clean-up recipes on instagram reels. buying enamel pins off etsy en masse. i was recently obsessed with peaky blinders and before that i was obsessed with watching every single film that had joseph gordon-levitt in it and before that i was obsessed with reading psychological horror manga. this is a habit of mine that is mostly not that harmful but i’d say is definitely somewhat of a problem, especially when it trends towards retail therapy and just impulse buying stuff that makes me momentarily happy. i just watched a video about someone doing a no-spend challenge for a month and it kind of made me realize how there is still a lot of room for me to mature when it comes to valuing what i have and prioritizing spending on experiences rather than material possessions. it’s definitely not the first time i’ve been made aware of this part of myself but hopefully it will be the first time i actually successfully do something about it there are a lot of things about myself that i want to change and improve and i think to some extent i have both changed and improved a lot in college. my sleep schedule has slowly been recovering this summer and i’m learning to cook and overall being more intentional and introspective and whatnot my friend (who really loves to ask questions, which is super cool and also nice because i don’t tend to do this and if i do it’s usually a stupid question like what’s your favorite fruit or something inconsequential) asked me the other day when i thought i had first become conscious or rather since when do i think i’ve been the person i am today (if that makes any sense?) and i kind of floundered about trying to answer this because on one hand, i like to think i’m truly the same person i was in middle school, maybe just changing externally or in my tastes, but at the same time i do think i’ve changed a lot i don’t actually know whether stuff i’m thinking about is stuff i’ve written in blogs before or stuff i’ve said to myself in my head and thought about writing down in blogs or stuff i’ve talked about with friends. sometimes a girl’s just gotta plagiarize herself. my friends and i have been talking about this kind of stuff a lot lately, actually. about how sweet it is to be a person living in a world and being surrounded by other people who are wholly themselves and distinct from us. about friendships and the newness of college and the newness of ourselves and aging and everything. i don’t know why we’re all suddenly thinking about this kind of stuff now that our freshman year is over but. either way i (spoiler!) have a blog that’s sort of about this that’s been in the works for a long time now so i’ll find something else to write about i don’t actually have any metric for how long 2750 words is supposed to be so i have no idea how close i’m getting. the google doc i’m writing on right now isn’t times new roman size 12 double spaced, i’m actually typing with trebuchet ms 11pt font right now, so i have no idea if i’m supposed to be on my sixth page yet or something like that. right now i’m coming up on the end of the third page so hopefully that’s good??? to be completely transparent i’m supposed to be writing this all continuously but i’m lowkey just going with the flow and
 
starting a new paragraph whenever a new thought pops up ⁠ 05 i've started employing this strategy whenever i write anything, because a lot of times i'll think of a specific string of words while i'm in the middle of typing something else, and think oh that's a banger, but then i forget it if i don't write it down right away oh actually just kidding the timer just went off !! good timing

Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne Before MIT, I had never been on a plane before. Hell, I had barely left California, with the exception of one or two family trips to Las Vegas. So, when I went to the east coast for my freshman fall, I was terrified. I had no clue how things  — even the supposedly “simple” things. I had no clue how to even board a plane, let alone how to get around
 
the city I was moving to. ⁠ 01 to be clear, my freshman fall was during COVID so I wasn't moving to campus, but I still decided to move to the east coast for reasons I'll get into later. I was scared. — At one point in  (one of my favorite books and plays), Christopher Boone decides to run away from home, but he never had to navigate the world on his own before. It scared him too: And then more people came into the little station and it became fuller and then the roaring began again and I closed my eyes and I sweated and felt sick and I felt the feeling like a balloon inside my chest and it was so big I found it hard to breathe. In the play, Christopher pictures his dad helping him. His dad says: Watch what the people do. Watch how they get on and off the train. Figure it out. Count the trains. Get the rhythm right. Train coming. Train stopped. Train going. Silence. Train coming. Train stopped. Train going. Silence. Train coming…. — When I got to the airport for my first ever flight, I watched what the people did, and I followed suit. And just like that, I wasn’t so scared anymore. Because, sure, figuring out the world all by yourself can be scary– especially as someone who doesn’t really “go with the flow”. But following a sequence of steps? That– that I can do. And these ‘steps’ don’t just come out of thin air most of the time. More often than not, you can observe and extrapolate. Watch what people do, and take the next step. The same thing is true in college… for the most part. — My freshman spring was the first time I ever came to campus, and the adults who drove my friends and I to MIT were   nervous. They wanted a detailed outline of what to expect when we arrived: how to check in, where to go for our COVID test, etc. etc.. But I wasn’t nervous at all. I knew how arriving to MIT would look like as a first year: Go to check in, and go where they tell you to go next. Lo and behold, that’s exactly what happened. I feel like this is a good example of what most of your freshman year looks like. At least during the first semester. The Office of the First Year does a really good job of trying to make sure that first years aren’t lost/confused about what you are supposed to be doing and when you are supposed to be doing it. But what do you do when you don’t know what to do (as a first year or otherwise)? Or when, if nothing else, you’re ready for something to be different? The reason I moved to the east coast my freshman fall (even though I couldn’t move to campus) was that I wanted something different. In this past  blog Pros: Safety and familiarity. 
Cons: Safety and familiarity. I had spent all of high school getting ready to one day go to college, and suddenly COVID was supposed to stop me? I didn’t think so. I didn’t know much, but I knew that I needed something different, and I didn’t know what to do. In the end, I figured it out on my own; I took a leap of faith and moved to New York. When I feel that way at MIT– when I don’t know what to do– I no longer feel like I need to figure things out on my own. Most of the time in undergrad, there is   who has been where you are at some point in their lives. This means that when you’re struggling with something, you can almost always turn to someone else and talk to them about it. Now, this doesn’t mean that it isn’t necessarily hard to do so; it can be hard to be that open and vulnerable with another person. But I think it’s important to try and talk to other people about these things. If anything, it gives you a chance to   upon the situation yourself. Even if sometimes you’re left still needing to take a leap of faith. This summer, I’ve been reflecting upon the fact that soon I will be applying to graduate school. I’ve been looking back on the past three years and realizing that in less than a year undergrad will be over. And you know what? I’m ready for something to be different. I think, for the first time, I’m ready to take this next step. But it’s still terrifying. So, I’ve been talking to people. I’ve been reaching out to alum friends and talking to them about the application process and how I’m   stressed about it. The end result of these conversations is always the same: I’m still ready to apply. But it makes it less scary. Less mysterious. More… human. It’s wild to me that three years ago I was just starting out here at MIT. I was barely learning the numbers of buildings and classes. And now here I am, preparing for one day being ready to leave. It’s the natural motion of the world. It’s the rhythm of the trains. Train coming. Train stopped. Train going. Silence. At the end of the play, Christopher reflects on all the things he’s done, and dreams about all the things he will one day do. And he essentially says: “You know how I know I can do these things? Look at all I’ve already done.” As if to say: I’ve made it this far. He then turns to the audience and says: “Does that mean I can do anything, you think? Does that mean, I can do anything?” And before someone can give an answer, the stage fades to black. — I’ve learned how to board a plane. I’ve struggled through three years at MIT. I’ve become comfortable in uncomfortability. Does that mean I can do anything, you think? Does that mean, I can do anything? Silence.

Every  day,  a cube calls to me. one decade ago Summer boredom loomed, then curiosity got the best of us. On one sweltering day, my oldest brother and I scootered over to Walmart with one goal in mind: acquire a Rubik’s cube. We had nothing else planned for the day, and decided to try something new. Intently following the instruction manual together, like building IKEA furniture, we eventually solved our first cube together. Oh, did joy fill the room! It wasn’t as hard as we made it out to be in our heads—we just patiently followed the book. “If the cube problem looks like this, here is the next step.” Man, if only life were always this easy. a love letter to polyhedral puzzles / a morning tendency Solving puzzles like these is one of the few activities that has stuck with me, like an itch that I just can’t shake. Polyhedral puzzles are beautiful both aesthetically and mathematically—visually simple yet mentally rigorous. There’s immediate satisfaction. The goal is straightforward. I can take it anywhere with me. Virtually every problem is new and different. There’s so many types of puzzles, ranging in shape, color, and movement. Pretty artwork and messages can be configured on them. Other people can scramble the puzzles for me. I can do it for a minute or for hours on end. I can hold the puzzles, and sometimes I admittedly hug them. I can’t help myself—they’re just so cute! And above all, it’s fun.  Over the years, I’ve loosely played with these puzzles off-and-on, meaning I picked them up whenever a random urge would hit. Only this past spring did I find myself incorporating them into my daily regimen. I don’t know what got into me, really—it just naturally came upon me. Gradually, every day, I found myself starting my day with the same thing. Ever y  morning, the first thing I do right after I wake up is solve a Rubik’s cube. averting morning brain drain This routine has been especially helpful for getting me out of bed, among other things that the cube gets me through in life. Sometimes, the morning can feel like such a drag, as if the entire world were jello and it’s a slog to move through any of it. So, in the eyes of someone who has just woken up, the combined ease of a cube being an arm swing away and gratification of a solve makes it an approachable, achievable goal. This helps me stay off my phone in the morning, too. I sought an activity to replace the stimulation that my brain likes from
 
perusing the internet ⁠ 01 and possibly getting sucked in for hours via the Dangerously Entertaining Forces of Scrolling “it’s the little things” It seems silly, but I’ve found that the cube gives me something to look forward to every day. I think that’s important. In fact, the “small” joys can feel even more central in my life than the “big” joys because they shape my daily life. I may not ride roller coasters every day, but I do solve my little cube. I enjoy the pillowy softness of my lotion when I apply it after a shower. I love the bittersweet mellowness of matcha in the morning. I like walking through my neighborhood and passing by this one tree with a tire swing hung from it. There’s  so  to love, even in the simple things. So, I try not to let the little moments of delight slip by. Every day, I do my best to squeeze as much joy as I can out of this sponge called life.  on habits Two quotes come to mind:  —Annie Dillard  —Will Durant
 02 derived from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, which I read in CC.110 Becoming Human, a philosophy course I had to take in my freshman year because I was in the Concourse program I think the act of maintaining a habit ultimately comes down to perpetually caring about your future self. Like, will brushing my teeth right now do that much for present-me? No, not really. My teeth feel about the same. But, will future-Kano be thankful for having healthy teeth because present-Kano brushed every day? Of course. With regard to the cube, I know I’ll be grateful for always trying to start off my day well.  Also, noticing my relationship with habits has helped me better understand how I feel. I’ve noticed that when I start to neglect the small things, the big things seem to unravel. Some specific cues that I’ve noticed include neglecting to brush my teeth, leaving the dishes overnight, and not watering my plants. They’re little checks to keep myself out of delusion. Specifically, there are times when I’ve convinced myself that I’m doing okay when I’m really not. The thoughts in my head may say one thing, but my actions say another, and I trust the actions. Albeit, I do admit that habits can feel strangely… confining? Like, ah yes, I am putting myself in habit jail for the rest of my life. But, I think that can be reframed as “I’m giving myself things to look forward to,” whether that be a nourished appetite, healthier skin, or simply happily getting out of bed in the mornings. And, of course, things change: the habits you live by can and will evolve with you. On the topic of reframing, I also think not being 100% on top of habits all of the time is perfectly okay. It’s natural. Instead of dwelling on a missed day, I try my best to remind myself that these moments are normal, accept that it has happened, and try to do better the next day.  So, yeah, most days I solve the cube. Some days, I don’t. And that’s okay. I just make my effort every day, for that’s all I can do.  nihilistic cubes / gamification of life The Rubik’s cube feels like a good metaphor for life. Why scramble it? Why solve it? All to come back to the same place in the end?  These questions remind me that I have a choice. I choose to play with cubes because I want to. I find it fun. I like the journey of the game, despite the ultimate perpetuity of making it through. John Green elaborates on this well in one of his  vlogs mit and the cube I would be remiss not to acknowledge MIT’s relationship with the Rubik’s cube. Yes, there’s a decent cubing scene. Our  club 03 although, there have been efforts in the past year to revive it world  record .  Yes, the cube is scattered in bits all around the  website  I do feel funny clarifying this, but if it wasn’t already clear, not everyone knows how to solve a Rubik’s cube, and nobody needs to. In fact, I’m pretty sure that most people I know at school don’t play with cubes. It’s just a fun thing some people do.  my collection I feel like a polygonal mother. These are my precious children. <3 I simply love them. They’re my little playthings, always there to elicit some joy. This summer, I’m learning the 4×4 and 5×5, with around a month left to go before the fall term begins. Wish me luck! I hope you have found or will find your “cube,” something that brightens your day—even in the slightest of ways.  It makes all the difference. Every night, the last thing I do right before bed is  scramb le  my Rubik’s cube. #existential fun #Morning #puzzles

We Aren’t Kids Anymore  by Drew Gasparini Almost two years ago, I was feeling angsty and wrote this  blogpost . Like we were supposed to just know where the lounge for our newly declared majors was, and like we were supposed to know how to advise actual first years on  where they should live [as though we should have a semblance of what dorm culture was after spending our first years on Zoom]. Through all of this angst, was ultimately the realization that time was passing. I would never get to redo my first year at MIT. Whether I liked it or not, whether I felt like it or not, I   a sophomore. But of course, with the speed at which MIT operates, I got over this fairly quickly. There really isn’t anything to do other than accept the reality when you have to start turning in problemsets and the semester is in full swing. Now, here we are two years later, about to become a senior this fall. Of course, one can argue over the semantics of whether or not the class of ’24 are seniors   [I mean, according to the student directory I’m already a fourth year….] but that’s besides the point. I’m entering my senior year– and it’s already beginning to have an (albeit mild) affect on my life. For instance, the other day my mom and I were talking about  when my graduation is. [*nervous laughter* it’s less than a year away] Another day recently, I had the realization that if I want hot cocoa/tea/coffee nights to be a thing on my wing of Next House, I would need to just make that  . And jesus christ, MIT alum friends of mine are talking to me about applying for graduate school. Which, to be clear, I deeply appreciate. It just makes me feel Old. I can only imagine how it makes y’all feel. I’ve just been realizing that  we   aren’t kids anymore. [omg it’s the title of the post] Recently (aka in the  last blog posted  know how to MIT very well– even after I eventually graduate. Which of course, there’s an sense of irony to that sentiment; the idea of feeling like I won’t ever know how to MIT well, while simultaneously knowing I will one day have ‘done’ MIT. And yet, I think it’s the most honest sentiment I can offer at this time. I haven’t had a semester here where I felt like I’ve just ‘gotten’ it, and I doubt I’ll ever have one. But being/becoming a senior, I’m going to have to act like I have my shit together. I’m going to have to run  REX events. I’m going to need to offer advice to incoming first years who ask for it (whether it be in the role as an associate advisor, or in the role of ‘generally older person’). I’m going to have to “get it”. Maybe that’s all there is to not being a kid anymore– playing pretend. I sure hope so, because beyond pretending, I don’t know who I’m supposed to be or what I’m supposed to be doing. I just know that I’m older and should act like it. And feeling angsty about that is no longer cute.

while planning a semester, I have some general sense of what I want out of the semester or a weak ideology with which I choose classes and activities. before sophomore fall, I chose classes I was interested in and I just took them. because I knew I wanted to take them more than I cared for whether I was ready for those classes. I took up all the activities that I wanted to take because I cared a lot about all of them.  although I was happy with how fall turned out in the end, I was miserable for the first half, both because I was physically unwell for a huge chunk and because I had a lot on my plate. dropping a class definitely helped but I knew I wanted to go into the next semester differently. I didn’t re-run for the Next House exec election. I promised myself I wouldn’t take
 
18.906 ⁠ 01 Algebraic Topology II so, after a pretty full
 
IAP, ⁠ 02 Independent Activities Period 
Listener ⁠ 03 this is similar to audit status. you have access to all the course content but you do not need to do any work for the class or take any exams and you do not get a grade. 1. 18.702: Algebra II this was my only math class this semester. I took it mostly because it would help me when I take algebraic geometry or more algebraic topology. the class is divided into three parts, covering representation theory, rings and an introduction to Galois theory.  I definitely spent less time on this class than I needed to. the representation theory part still eludes me the most. I feel like I will need to watch the lecture videos or read the book like three more times to fully understand it.  the professor for this class was really good. I did often feel that the class demanded a certain level of mathematical maturity and went at a pace faster than I could keep up with but the professor was clear in his explanations and was passionate about the content.  2. 8.04: Quantum Physics I I really like the professor for this class. he was really nice and accommodating, but was sometimes too smart for me to understand him. we didn’t have lecture recordings available until the end of the class but watching MITx videos after lecture helped me with understanding a lot.  I didn’t do that well in the class but had a good experience. a bunch of my friends were in the class and collaborating with them made the experience so much better than it would have been otherwise. I also had a mentor for this class, Pam S. ’23, who was so smart and helpful. Zimi Z. ’25 and I would be asking the stupidest of questions and she would answer us patiently and helped us so much through so many conceptual gaps. 3. 6.1210 (6.006): Introduction to Algorithms I took 6.006 for real this time and it was a much better experience than last semester. In lectures and recitations, I felt like I was thoroughly understanding the content and was able to solve problems a lot better than last semester. I started working with Julia L. ’26 and my roommates  Jenny whether I know people who are in the class was not normally a factor for me while choosing classes, so the key realization from both 6.006 and 8.04 was how useful it can be to have good people to work with. 4. 5.111: Principles of Chemical Science I finally took chemistry, yay! I first met Julia in my 5.111 recitation but then we also started working on 6.006 together. the class went well for me! the pace was reasonably fast but I had seen some of the content before so it was fine overall. who knows, maybe I will take
 
5.12 ⁠ 04 Organic Chemistry I 5. 21L.487: Modern Poetry I took Modern Poetry this semester. I took the class with Katherine L. ’24! She is the
 
local literature genius ⁠ 05 the class anthology, some would say the professor for this class knows so much about literature and poetry. I found the class structure to be very different from
 
21L.004, ⁠ 06 Reading Poetry 6. 12.409: Hands-On Astronomy: Observing Stars and Planets and the best for last! both the staff and the students were so nice and passionate that the class itself became a great community. the class taught me to use telescopes and cameras for low-light photography. at the end of the class, every student collected a portfolio out of the pictures they had taken throughout the semester.   oftentimes, before our Wednesday night lab sections, I would think to myself that I am too tired to be out in the cold for 3 hours, but whenever we would get out observing, I would forget everything else. it has definitely converted me to become an Astronomy minor!  Previous Next 7. UPOP: Undergraduate Practice Opportunities Program the last two units came from UPOP Team Training Workshop (TTW) and UPOP for the Spring. I felt slightly out of place for Spring milestones because I knew I didn’t want to apply to an internship for the summer but TTW was fun regardless. it was very hectic but I had a great team and a great mentor. I also got to talk to another mentor who was really nice and gave me very helpful advice.  in the fall, I felt that the classes I learned best from were the ones I poured a lot of time into, which is not surprising but I guess I realized that it takes me more time than the average to gain something useful and lasting out of the class. I think when I was planning this semester, I was looking forward to a relatively chill semester. I could not have been more wrong. if I could have put just a little more into 8.04 or 18.702, I would have gotten a lot more out of those classes. my advisor would always tell me that you do the best math when you have time to breathe and time to think. the enticing variety of classes and limited time you have at MIT, again and again, forces you to take up a lot. I don’t think I had time to breathe last semester or think deeply about anything I was doing. looking at the next semester is again a struggle. I want to take fewer classes, so I can explore more than the required around those classes but, I also want to take a lot of classes, all of which sound so interesting. I am trying to find a balance that lets me take fewer classes, some that help me get requirements out of the way and some completely random ones that I just want to take. my two main extracurriculars for the spring were being Treasurer for
 
MIT SAAS ⁠ 07 MIT South Asian Association of Students 
DormCon. ⁠ 08 Dormitory Council  we had two big events for SAAS this semester, Eid and Holi, for which I was writing a ton of funding applications and helping out with prep before and during the events. we also had a bunch of other exciting events, out of which I could only go to a couple. DormCon had to deal with a lot of different things and though I tried my best, I could have been there a lot more than I was. I had been able to keep up my pace of writing a poem a week for the entirety of last year. this spring, I wrote three poems, out of which two were unfinished. I barely wrote on the blogs. I had close to zero creative energy the entire semester, which was also a reminder of how much space I personally need to be able to think clearly and write cohesively. I continued TAing for
 
18.03 ⁠ 09 Differential Equations 
ESG, ⁠ 10 Experimental Study Group, a first-year learning community in other random things, I went to SAYI, which I wrote about  here I taught a Spark class about plants with Katie K. ’24, who is the local plant genius! Spark is one of the programs run by ESP that  C J other bloggers during some 6.006 lecture, Nora and I started talking about Turbo, the snail from Turbo, the animated movie and we decided to watch it some time after 6.006 psetting. this turned into several, usually impromptu movie nights, all of which were absurd animated movies, that were really fun to watch.
 
4W ⁠ 11 four west, my wing in Next House Mamma Mia in terms of student performances, I went to see the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble production of Julius Caesar. Prajna N. ’25 was producer this semester for the show and Kelsey G. ’24 was front of the house manager! I also went to see the Asymptones concert, where Alan Z. ’23, Silu S. ’24 and Arthur D. ’23 were performing. it was also Alan’s birthday that day so we got to wish them mid-show. I also went to the Asian Dance Team’s showcase where Jonathan H. ’25, Z C. ’25, Maggie Y. ’25, Dora H. ’25, Jamie, Derek, so many people were performing! it was my first time watching an ADT showcase and it was incredible! there was a mix of very mellow and very loud songs, but they balanced each other pretty well. it was very loud throughout though, but that mostly meant the crowd was very energetic. I also went to the
 
CMSW ⁠ 12 Comparative Media Studies and Writing I was on campus during spring break and did not have much planned so I worked desk a lot, did my taxes and caught up with a lot of people. Prajna, Jyotsna N. ’25, Margaret Z. ’23 and I had a lowkey Taylor Swift listening party in the McCormick West Penthouse which was really fun! I watched Kabhi Khushi, Kabhi Gham with Prajna and Jyotsna, which is supposed to be one of the old Bollywood classics but I had never watched it before. I visited the Harvard Art Museums with Zimi and we ended up roaming around their Science building afterwards. it was not their spring break so we saw a lot of students going to classes and working so we got to rejoice in their misery. I also went to Portland, Maine with Alan, Jonathan and Lynette C. ’24. We drove there around 6 in the morning and came back around 9. We went to the Portland Museum of Art. In addition to their permanent art collections, which were pretty cool, they had an Art in Bloom exhibition going on, spread throughout the museum. Previous Next

NACT ⁠ 15 Next Act, a Next House club that puts together a musical production every CPW. 
Silu, ⁠ 16 forever the main character I went with Nora to a poetry reading by Ross Gay! I read his book   for my poetry class in the fall and I loved it. he ended up reading an essay about cover songs from his book Inciting Joy and it was so incredible. not just the work, but his energy is so straightforward and kind. the way he reads the work also adds something extra and it was an honor to listen to him read! speaking of honors, I also got to go to Gilbert Strang’s last linear algebra lecture! I have never even had him as a professor but it was so touching to be there and hear him talk about his long career and relationship with MIT. I stuck around for a little bit after finals week so I had some downtime before leaving campus. I went to New Jersey to the Taylor Swift concert with Prajna and Jyotsna and since I can’t talk about that in moderation, I will simply not talk about it. when I was not away, I played a lot of mahjong in the 4W main lounge and watched some assortment of things, including the first Harry Potter movie and a Very Potter musical. I also volunteered for commencement! I was at the info desk at the advanced degrees ceremony for the School of Science. I ran into my 8.04 professors there, which was really nice! the other volunteers were also very nice and we were all getting really happy and excited watching the graduates and their families, who came from all over to attend the ceremonies. every semester teaches a new lesson about how to make decisions for the next one. I am halfway done with MIT and I still do not know how to MIT very well.  with the multiple pset deadlines every week, often coupled with other commitments, it really feels impossible to get everything done sometimes. but, you get through it. every week. you take extensions, you get help. or you don’t. but, you get through it. I have heard MIT students post-graduation say that one of their key takeaways from MIT was a sense of courage and belief that things will get done, no matter how impossible it seemed in the time being. I have realized that I don’t want to just get through it. I don’t want to be miserable the whole time for this lesson. I ascribe so much value to the process that even if I end up with a good score or a great project at the end, it will not feel worth it if I was sad and angry the whole time. I do not like waking up with IHTFP being the first thought on my mind. so I am not going to choose to be overly miserable to get something done. I am going to simply,  , fail. one of the most detrimental things you could do at MIT is determining your self worth based on how much you are doing. there is usually a lot to do but there are ways to make it a little easier or a lot harder for you. oftentimes, it boils down to your ego and out of all the things to consider, that, in my opinion, is the stupidest way to choose to not drop something. I am not going to choose to pat my ego over my happiness, which is already very hard to choose in places where productivity is so highly valued. I am relearning to find meaning in the way I approach things. I put a lot of thought into everything I do and that usually means I cannot do a lot. but even the small things mean a lot to me. the point is not to fill up every waking moment with something productive or to finish everything you start. my friend Jonathan says there is always tomorrow. I don’t believe that.  everything will not get done  is a very humbling realization. it feels like I am losing a core part of why I belong at MIT. but, I do not think any of us are here because we can do the impossible. I do not think we are expected to break our backs to try to fit some image of what an MIT student is supposed to be like. I think we are mostly here because we cared about things and we will continue to care even when things don’t get done. in a completely academic context, a lot of the classes I have taken still feel unfinished and open, not because I have actual work for them but because I care about the content and want to learn it at a deeper level. so, maybe feeling like things are unfinished is not that bad. the lack of closure is also an expression of care. this is not to say that the alternative implies you do not care. what I am trying to say is that completing tasks and reaching goals is not the only way to measure care or success. yes, there will always be regrets. because there will always be care. #12.409 #18.702 Algebra II #5.111 #6.006 #8.04 #classes #Next House

Many months ago, I broke my water bottle cap. I tried to find a replacement cap or even a replacement bottle of the exact model so that I could harvest the cap. But alas it was simply not attainable for reasons detailed in this dormspam I sent out of desperation: I will pay $15 for an H2GO 20.9oz asi51197. If you attended the  Green Hills Software Story behind this is that I dropped my H2GO 20.9oz asi51197 from a great height of three feet and the lid broke. I could just use one of my countless other swag water bottles, but I’ve accumulated a year’s worth of stickers on this one that I refuse to throw out. Apparently H2GO is a brand that exclusively does corporate swag, so if I wanted to buy one, I’d have to buy 500. I’ve also asked several hallmates to let me see if their hydroflask/other branded lids work on mine. Unfortunately they did not, so i am resorting to dormspam. Best, 
Audrey bcc’d to dorms green hills software green Previous Next Someone actually responded! We met up at Maseeh and exchanged $15 for a water bottle that the other party probably got for free. But a second chance at life for my dear water bottle, one covered in stickers bearing grand stories and cherished memories, was priceless. I broke my water bottle cap AGAIN in the exact same place last week. It was on the ledge of my lofted bed. I must’ve kicked it off in my sleep. Not only did the thin plastic shatter, so did my heart. For I knew that to be the end of my water bottle. Luck had it that my laptop screen recently started flickering, to the point where looking at it instantly made my head hurt. My laptop also had barely one working usb port left and a broken internal mic, so it was also time for my laptop and her beloved case to go. my dearest laptop case But my water bottle and laptop case’s legacy will live on through this blog. I admit that I wrote this blog for selfish reasons; like yes I want to share what each sticker means to me but I really just want to immortalize them somewhere on the Internet. Material possessions may come and go, but digital footprints are forever. sorry it’s partially cut off I wasn’t born a firebender, so I settled for joining  Spinning Arts I love making these opportunities happen and watching individuals grow over time as both performance artists and leaders responsible for keeping the club safe. As a result, I’m serving on the exec team for my third year now (I’m president this year)! I designed this sticker for the club two years ago, heavily inspired by the phoenix imagery from  the old (aka pre-pandemic) club branding. The phoenix imagery is quite fitting for our club at this point of time. The pandemic gouged huge gaps in club knowledge that we’re still rebuilding to this day, but each cycle of new members and emerging leaders makes our community that much stronger, more vibrant, and alive. All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. But now I know what it really is.

Previous Next Fun fact: this sticker design has already seen the light of the blogs, in  this is fine If the Stickman sticker was a positive representation of my freshman spring, this one is its negative corollary. Our class lost so much to the pandemic: we did our first semester completely virtually, and we were allowed on campus for our second semester, but with heavy restrictions and still mostly virtual classes. The world was metaphorically on fire (and literally if you were in California at that time), yet somehow we were expected to do our classes, figure out how to MIT, and otherwise proceed as if  . I think the idea behind my sticker resonated with many of my classmates, as I’ve seen it on so many laptops across campus. Apparently it also made its way into a Caltech discord server: I don’t get how it’s an insult?? Y’all are the clowns for having to   use another school’s graphics but I digress.

Our followers have told us that they love sharing and enjoying our comics with their fellow nerd friends/family/partners. And Instagram insights corroborate with the fact that our comics are being shared. Sometimes people tag their friends in the comment section too. It’s so heartwarming to hear that we add a bit of laughter to people’s days.  We also think  about how we can build community beyond just drawing comics. That has led to two successful Nerdy Pickup Line Tournaments, distributing physical Valentine’s Day cards to all students living on campus last spring, and emailing a couple hundred virtual cards as well.

Apparently, you can read the resistance of a resistor by looking at the four colored bands. Each band corresponds to a number determined by the color code, and the resistance can be calculated as ([first band]*10 + [second band]) * 10^[third band]. The fourth band is the resistance tolerance, which tells you how precise the actual resistance is in comparison to the labeled resistance.

Last October, I went to  MICE Winnie got me these adorable possums from the Boston Dyke March last year. Dark Monk Flowtoys I bought a pair of Podpoi from Flowtoys last year to explore these artistic possibilities. They were quite the investment, but they’ve been so worth it. Podpoi in particular have a lifetime warranty, can be programmed and synced up with other pairs of Podpoi too. My new water bottle and laptop are currently devoid of stickers. While Victorian era widows were expected to mourn for two years, I’m sure my old water bottle and laptop case would want us to move on, to live life to fullest. I see many more stickers in my future, but I’ll never forget the ones that came before us. #laptop stickers

I hate Bevi. It’s frustratingly slow, the user interface makes me want to pound my head against a wall, and it costs hundreds of dollars per month to operate on top of that. Overall, a terrible product. The industrial revolution and its consequences… If you were lucky enough to be blissfully unaware of Bevi’s existence, prepare to have your day ruined as I tell you all about it. Bevi is a “smart” water “dispenser” company  started at MIT . I put “smart” in quotation marks because Bevi machines stop working as soon as the WiFi goes out (
 
which happens at MIT more than I’m proud to admit ⁠ 01 Ironically, most often in computer-science classes because there are so many people in them. So. Unbearably. Slow. That I always end up contemplating what went wrong in the past few minutes for me to have the misfortune of using a Bevi machine. (The reason is usually that the other water dispenser on my floor in the office is, against all odds, worse than the Bevi machine. The sensor doesn’t quite work, so I always feel like Velma from Scooby-Doo fumbling around for her glasses when I try pouring myself a drink using it.) I could go on for hours ranting about how much I despise Bevi… but this post isn’t about that. I want the MIT Admissions Blogs to remain a platform for positivity, so here’s a story about the one time when Bevi brought a glimmer of joy into my life. But first, I need to give you more background about how Bevi works. If you’ve used a Bevi machine after July 2020, you’ve likely noticed the random QR code that appears on the touchscreen interface. Scan it, and it’ll direct you to a “mobile dispense” webpage where you can control the machine remotely using your phone. The feature was probably implemented as some kind of COVID-prevention measure, but my first impressions from last summer were more along the lines of “Woah, I can dispense water from  two  feet away now instead of just  one  foot away! Thanks, big tech – you always know exactly what I need.” And so, my opinion of Bevi remained that way until one fateful night this summer when I was on a call with some friends. My friends on that call are interning in San Francisco this summer, so we were busy comparing the differences in office amenities between the East and West Coasts. As usual, I was complaining about how Bevi was literally ruining my life for real. Suddenly, a crazy idea struck me. “Hey Steven,” I said as I held my phone up against the screen of a nearby Bevi machine, “Can you try scanning this QR code, please?” I was fully expecting the machine to freak out and passive-aggressively tell me to get better at dispensing water, but to our surprise, the QR code lit up green and morphed into a circle. “Mobile connected”, the screen read as Steven was presented with a phone menu for choosing flavour options. I was too stunned to say anything, but Steven wasted no time pouring me an ice-cold cup of sparkling lime-mango water from San Francisco, over 2500 miles away. It was a truly magical feeling, and I think you really need to experience it first-hand to understand how I felt at that moment. It was a bit like that famous scene from  Tarzan  where Tarzan and Jane first touched hands (only if Jane was still in Europe and Tarzan in Africa). From that day on, I’ve had a newfound respect for Bevi. Not that I don’t intensely dislike it anymore, don’t get me wrong, but rather that Bevi is more than just a glorified kitchen faucet to me now. … all this unhinged ranting to say that this blog post and the water in my bottle were (as Petey aptly puts it at the end of his emails) Sent by the magic of mobile technology #Course 6 - Electrical Engineering & Computer Science

It is summer in Cambridge, which means that: AirNow Great Concavity Cattley Guava share your garbage with the world What does it mean to be an admissions blogger? MIT students are the Institute’s best ambassadors. Admissions officers can explain complicated processes and provide words of wisdom, but we can’t write about what it’s like to live on Conner 2, or plan REX, or UROP, or decide how to pick your classes, or a really cool new thing you learned today in class, and so forth. The mission of the blogs is to help our students communicate what MIT is actually like. We do this by hiring students who have good judgment, a compelling voice and perspective, and the disciplined exuberance to post at least twice a month on average. We may ask you to help advise creative projects in the office and serve as a touchstone for student culture. We pay you for this work. It’s a pretty good gig, to be honest. Your application will be read by a small committee made up of AOs, senior bloggers, and a few blogger cruft. This application itself was designed mostly by student bloggers to help ask and answer the kinds of questions that might be useful for identifying their kin. Please note that *only* current MIT students may apply to be bloggers (i.e. no prospective students or students at other colleges). This application is open to all MIT undergraduates of any class year. This application will go live on 07/01/2023, and close on 8/01/2023. Anyone who has started their application by 08/01/2023 will have a grace period of 7 days to complete and submit it. We will begin reviewing applications after the grace period, and hope to select and alert bloggers before orientation if at all possible. If this sounds like something you might like to do, then  fill out the blogger application . If anything isn’t clear,
 
let me know in the comments or via email! ⁠ 01 However, please note I am on vacation and/or away for work travel for much of July, so my response may be delayed.

I recently downloaded a chess app on my phone. Now, I know people who have been reading chess books since grade school and have numerous opening plays memorized, but to be entirely clear, I’m not one of them. My older brother didn’t have the patience to play chess with me (I had a tendency to just sort of… not follow the rules), and as a result I never actually picked it up. I didn’t even remember all of the names (much less the movements) of all the chess pieces when I decided to hit the download button. The other day, I called Allen, one of the underclassmen in my wing, and he (very patiently) coached me through a game. It took an hour – I’m kind of painfully bad at chess right now. I’m also incredibly sucky at videogames. I sometimes play my friend Satya in Smash, and I don’t think I’ve ever managed to kill him more than once. I fall off stage, use my special attack at the wrong moment, and if I’m not playing Samus I’ll spend the better part of the game just bashing buttons. I still play Smash, though, and I’ll probably try to continue playing chess once in a while, too. And, like, sure, I could make this post about tenacity, or whatever. But I think my suckiness at Smash is interesting because it’s probably not temporary. I’m almost certainly not going to put in the hours required to be good at chess, or learn to play Smash really well, because they’re just not a priority. I hope eventually I’ll be passable at these things, but I don’t mind the fact that I do these things, I’m bad at them, and I probably will be for a while. It’s easy to interpret that as lazy. And maybe it is – I’m not sure that it’s necessarily the most disciplined philosophy. And I won’t deny that progress can sometimes creep up on you. I am now able to squat more than my body weight, despite being pretty weak when I started college, because I just kept going to the gym, kind of thoughtlessly. It wasn’t my whole life, and I often ignored it in favor of PSETs and meetings, but I did it because it was fun and appealing. But I want to emphasize that progress doesn’t have to be the end goal. I think recognizing and accepting that I can be really bad at things was one of the most freeing decisions I’ve ever made. It wasn’t an easy epiphany to come to. One of the things about MIT is the stunning awareness that you’re surrounded by people that pick things up at lightning speed. I’ll turn my head and realize that my friend has become surprisingly good at parallel algorithms or Hollow Knight in the course of a few weeks. Nowadays, it’s mostly just a source of quiet appreciation, one of those moments when you think to yourself,  It didn’t used to feel like that, though. When I was a freshman, many of my friends used to play a game called Tractor, which I believe they learned at competitive math camps (?). I abhor Tractor, with a burning passion. It’s mildly interminable, since in order to successfully win a game you have to get through 14 rounds. It’s played in silence, because you have to remember the number of cards of a certain type that have been placed down, and that requires a lot of concentration (at least on my part). Everyone knows the quiet shame of being the worst at something in a group of people who don’t have the patience for you. You’re petrified of slipping up, perpetually defending yourself from mild jeering after every mistake, and for some reason it really hurts to feel irredeemably terrible at something, even when that something is as simple as a card game. Somehow being bad at cards feels like an indictment of your intelligence; everyone is looking at you because you’re the dumb one who messed up. Of course, most people probably don’t really care whether you remembered to place down your queen of hearts, but some people are so competitive, it can feel like not being among the best at an arbitrary skill is a personal failure. The first time I played Tractor, I was introduced to it alongside my friend, who was better at math and had played many more card games than I had. I admitted that I suspected I wouldn’t be as good of a player as he was, so my partner should accept me as a major handicap. Another friend paused, asking why I thought I’d be any worse than him, since we had approximately the same (nonexistent) experience. My fellow newbie laughed, and as I accepted my hand from him, he leaned forward conspiratorially, and simply stated “I’m just   than her.”  I felt a soft burning in my nose and realized with a shock that his dig had hurt. It was as if the statement had plunged its hands right into my chest, yanking the insecurity and teary embarrassment of grade-school Shorna straight from my past. I mentally chastised myself – I was too old for this, too grown, too capable to be hurt over a card game. But when I left the room, the tears still came. Admittedly, I had pretty bad taste in friends when I was a frosh, and I eventually realized that. The hate for card games stuck around, though. A friend and I exchanged practically identical stories about Tractor not too long ago. This past CPW, one of my freshmen was on Next CPW Comm, and suggested a Tractor Event. I reacted almost immediately, pressing that he should host something with wider appeal. A nearby prefrosh lazily cocked his head at me and simply said, “If you don’t like cards, maybe you don’t fit Next House culture” I stared at him, disgust bubbling under the surface. I stayed up for over 30 hours making the 2023 Next House i3 video when the first one fell through. I’m the Vice President of Next, and I put so much work into making the house run and keeping 3E welcoming and clean. I wanted to chew him out, to put him in his place, to call him out on his bullshit. But I was a soon-to-be junior and he was just a kid, so I held my tongue and simply shrugged, noted that “Next House is a heterogenous place”, gave a final suggestion against cards, and left. I find it hard to overstate how badly I   want to make anyone feel like that. To be clear, I think this is representative of the actions of a few bad apples, not the culture of MIT (or Next) as a whole; most people I’ve met here are helpful, charitable, and compassionate. More importantly, though, I have simply learned that I just want to be able to teach my friends things without making them feel inept. I like asking my friends to paint with me. It’s stupid – I’ll pull out my portable watercolors, hand them a brush and a cup of water, and let them work. It makes me unreasonably happy. I say this with love in my heart – some people are shockingly bad at painting. I don’t care whether or not it looks good, though, because a person I care about is spending time with me doing a thing I love. I guess the best way I have to express this is actually through a line from Adventure Time. There’s a scene in which Jake, the older brother (who… also happens to be a very elastic dog) assures the main character, Finn, that “sucking at something is the first step to being really good at something”. It’s a little bit silly, but to be honest I think the correct philosophy is just that “sucking at something doesn’t have to suck”. I spent that hour with Allen groaning over the fact that I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to prevent him from taking my bishop. And Satya has somehow managed to not get exasperated at me despite the numerous hours playing Smash I’ve spent dying, over and over and over again. Having casual relationships with your skills is important – you don’t have to be the best at anything, or even particularly good at many things, to be worthy of grace. So, in too many words, don’t let your fear of sucking at something get in the way of actually sucking at it, because with the right people, sucking at something should never make you feel inadequate, and it should, actually, be a little bit wonderful.

I found one of my old sketchbooks the other day. I’m ashamed that this “old” sketchbook, which I had started in 2019 (that’s four years ago!!), is also my most recent sketchbook because I’ve hardly drawn for myself since starting college. I’ve made a ton of art for my clubs at MIT and for Admissions, but when was the last time I sat down and let myself draw or paint without expectations? My high school friend Deelia is an art and
 
human factors ⁠ 01 my understanding is that this program covers user centric design from both artistic and engineering lenses Gallery 263 
one structured life drawing session before, ⁠ 02 if you don't count creepily drawing classmates during boring high school classes or strangers at a cafe The session hits the ground running with 1 minute poses. Every mark I leave on the paper, I make with intention because I only have time for so many. Humans are a living, breathing sack of flesh with so many different planes and contours. It’s fun to choose which ones to emphasize with such a limited set of lines. Learning how to distill the complicated human form into marks on a paper is why most models are nude and why these sessions are done live! Drawing from a photographic reference removes the process of translating a 3D form into 2D, while live drawing makes you do just that. Of course, I’m acutely aware that model is real person whose body is being scrutinized from every angle, and I try my best to approach the session with respect and sensitivity. As the poses fly by, my markmaking feels increasingly fluid — “looseness” is the dynamic, expressive quality that many strive for in their sketches. My high school art teacher’s biggest piece of feedback for me was to loosen up, and I’ve never quite understand what that means until recently. Upon peeking at other artists’ sketches, the ones that stand out to me don’t necessarily copy the model’s exact form, but rather take artistic liberty to exaggerate certain contours. By protruding an arm or pushing out a hip, they create fluid motion in an otherwise static drawing. The two minute poses feel similar to the one minute poses, except now I have a bit of extra time to add just a smudge of shading. It’s feeling looser, but it’s not exactly where I want it to be. I peek at Deelia’s sketchbook and notice how much depth and motion she’s able to get in such little time with charcoal. Previous Next So for the 5 minute poses, I try charcoal for the first time. Deelia explains to me that using charcoal is one of the first things they teach you to use at a college art program. Because charcoal is a blunt stick, as opposed to a pencil sharpened to a fine point, it’s difficult to control. And when something is hard to control, you simply don’t. Instead of trying to capture outlines and details, you use charcoal to capture the broad shapes of light and shadow. I find a process that seems to work for me: first I rub charcoal in a vaguely human shaped blob and smudge it out with my finger. With a kneaded eraser, I remove patches of charcoal to carve out areas of highlight. Then I go back in with the charcoal to deepen shadows, rub away highlights with the eraser, and repeat this process of give and take until the five minutes are up. I’m really proud of the sketch of the model’s back! I did my first strict pullup last year and shaping the subtle contours of the model’s back reminds me of all the exercises I did to build up my upper back strength. For the the 10 minute poses, I switch to a gouache palette that I brought with me. It’s such a shame that I’ve hardly touched it since high school, but gouache is my absolute favorite medium. Gouache is commonly described as, if acrylic and watercolor had a finicky child. It’s opaque like acrylic, but water soluble like watercolor so you can reactivate dried layers of paint. As a result you can sort of layer gouache, but light colors tend to dry darker and dark colors tend to dry lighter. You can see this effect on the grayish patch on the model’s shoulder on the left. I add light blue, almost white paint to that section in attempt to capture a highlight, but it mixes with the existing brown underlayer to create that unsavory gray. But I love gouache with all my heart for it’s ability make bold strokes. In the movie
 ⁠ 03 literally my favorite movie “I had a painting teacher once tell me that the difference between a good painting and a great painting is typically five strokes.  And they’re usually the five boldest strokes in the painting.  The question, of course, is which five strokes?” ~ Aster to Ellie I’m not necessarily striving for a “great” painting here. I just want to have fun with art again. But it’s a good reminder to paint fearlessly. Even if humans aren’t exactly purple, purple is great for creating bold shadows in human skin. I apply cool purples liberally to create contrast against the warm yellows, reds, and browns that color living flesh. The 20 minute pose feels like eternity. I take my sweet time to carefully build up layers of color. I avoid muddying up the areas where the studio lights directly hit the model, like the face and left shoulder. But I notice that the muddied area in my 10 minute painting would look great in areas softly illuminated by reflected backlighting. So I add the blue-white paint to the model’s back and right shoulder to represent that softer backlighting. I’m happy with that choice! “Love is being willing to ruin your good painting for the chance at a great one.” ~ Ellie to Aster Even if a bold stroke doesn’t work out in one painting, it can still work in another. I’ve been drawing for most of my life. I have the privilege of having taken studio art classes in elementary and middle school, which have been instrumental in teaching me the foundations of observation, sketching, and color. In high school, I had the opportunity to give back and teach younger kids at the same art studio, which has given me a lot of time to think about explaining something as subjective as art in definite terms. Even though I’ve been art-ing for a while, art is a lifelong learning process. I’ve learned so much in the two hour long life drawing session just by carefully observing both the model and sketches from the people around me. That’s another benefit of life drawing sessions: getting to observe and be inspired by other people’s processes. Art brings back the joy that I’ve sometimes lost sight of when work piles up and I get hosed. I know how to make bold strokes; I just need to pick up my sketchbook more. #life drawing #the half of it quotes

(Check out what I did  last summer I’m staying on-campus again! I’m continuing my Spring  
UROP ⁠ 01 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. Undergrads get to participate in real research with professors. Without going into the details of the research project, the general idea is that I’m working on a program that can navigate several robots such that they’ll follow a trajectory that helps them reach their goal. It’s a mix of formation control and neural networks within the field of autonomous robot systems. my project so far is just code, so i don’t have any pretty pictures to show you just yet During the spring, I was able to get a simulation of the program working so that it finds an optimal path for multiple robots to get to a destination. The goal this summer is to get that program working in actual robots. This process is called sim2real, or simulation-to-real. After that, the next goal is to improve the program so these robots can traverse different kinds of environments, like rough or unstable terrain. And then I will create Skynet. I got two jobs this summer: UROP in the day and desking at night. If you’re a student, you get the chance to have free summer housing if you’re hired as a desk worker. Hence why I’m living at Burton-Conner for free. Desk work is chill. You handle packages and mail that come into the building, but there’s a great chunk of downtime that comes with it. During the semester, students work on problem sets or procrastinate on them. I’ve been mostly playing games and occasionally busting out some writing. In fact, I’m writing this post right now while I’m on my shift. katana action in Superhot I’m working out, baby! I like exercising, and I want to be strong. Unfortunately, my laziness is usually stronger. But things WILL be different this summer. Reasons why: Making illustrations for the next   (or HowToGAMIT for short). It’s a student-produced handbook that’s a guide “written by students, for students.” You can get an idea of what it’s about  here It’s sci fi! I’ve always wanted to write a book, but it’s much harder than I expected. I’m going to be an FPOP counselor for the First-year Arts Program this summer! FPOPs, or First-year Pre-Orientation Programs, are week-long programs that incoming freshmen have a chance to participate in before Orientation. There’s a whole list of them, and they have themes that range from entrepreneurship to ocean engineering to outdoor activities. I got to do the First-year Arts Program when I was a pre-frosh, and I met people who are still friends to this day. But more importantly, I have very good memories illustrating a Tim the Beaver x John Harvard fancomic. I’m not the only blogger who’ll be a counselor this year!

This year, I made a spread for MIT’s  Infinite Magazine , and now that I am  , I feel like I have time to write about it. I’ve been a part of Infinite since I came to MIT, and I highly recommend it. There’s a role for everyone. During my first semester, I met someone who joined solely because he was obsessed with typeface. Like   with fonts… If you’re interested, there are already some well-written MIT blogs about  Infinite MIT Gala This year, the theme of the magazine was  . At first, I had no idea what I wanted to do with that. But I did know that inside me there are two demons. Demon #1 –  Demon #2 –  And my spread,  , was born. It initially didn’t have that name. I think someone on the board called it  , which I thought was ridiculous, but I stuck with that name until a few weeks before release, when I asked Chat-GPT to name it for me. The inspiration for   was that I wanted to crochet organs and then affix them to humans. I thought it would be funny. Also, without getting too 6-9, I’ve always been fascinated with the levels of abstraction that exist within the physical form. For most people, you don’t have to learn   about your body for your body to work. And yet, it does. And you can just walk around with the understanding that the body is a sack of liquid and flesh. And trillions of cells will conduct incredibly complex processes regardless. And even the people who have dedicated their entire lives to studying the body and the mind will die with some of these complex processes left undiscovered. Less philosophically, I also thought about these: Anyways, here is the spread! I will include the names of the models below, but I would also like to give a special thanks to my photographer Marina T. ’25, and editor Angelica Z. ’26. And if the quality is bad it is because I screenshotted it from a PDF, which you can find in better resolution at the website I linked above!

I can’t wait to write one of those class tier list blogs before I graduate, and I know for sure that
 
6.115 ⁠ 01 or 6.2060 according to the new numbering system, which does not deserve rights I signed up for 6.115 because I needed a lab class to fulfill a course 6-9 requirement. 6.115 is known as the hardware appreciation class, and having little prior experience with this kind of stuff, I wanted to appreciate hardware. It helped that a handful of my friends felt like signing up for
 
hell ⁠ 02 more on this later ;-; I walked into the first lecture wondering, what even is a microcontroller (or microcomputer)? When Steve asked the class that question, people responded with answers along the lines of “a small computer” or “a single chip designed to do things” or “[insert hardware jargon that I don’t remember because I had no idea what they meant at that time].” Steve immediately rattled off counterexamples for every single definition. Apparently there’s no specific feature that makes a processor a microcontroller, versus just a CPU, as microcontrollers are so vaguely defined. (Thank you Callie for reminding me exactly what Steve said here; her ability to retain content from lecture was unmatched). I still don’t know what a microcontroller is, but no one really does either. Steve had a very distinctive style of lecturing that I can only describe as an ~experience~. His incredibly animated personality and propensity to call electronic components “dude” made me want to absorb everything he was saying. But he went  I looked down for five seconds to jot down some notes. I looked up and he was talking about an entirely new topic. I was feeling unsure of myself after having understood approximately 1.28% of what was said in lecture, but it was reassuring to know that some of my friends were in the same boat. Lab was a whole ‘nother experience. I easily put 20 hours/week into 6.115 labs, structuring my eating schedule, sleeping schedule,   around the lab hours. Basically whenever I wasn’t at another class or at a Spinning Arts related thing or
 
sleeping, ⁠ 03 I once fell sleep on the narrow, hard, not-ergonomically-suited=for-sleeping bench outside of the 6.115 lab and another time napped on a couch inside the nearby bathroom... I do not miss those days don’t bring this to the airport I often joked that 6.115 in a nutshell was, “how do you make something that takes 10 minutes on an Arduino take 10 hours on an 8051 microcontroller instead?” The point was to strip things we often take for granted, like how Arduinos can read analog values, down to the bare bones of creating pulses of electricity for the right amount of time at the right place. And through that we truly understand what’s going on under the hood in a microcontroller. the very climatic result of 20 hours of work: turning on a fluorescent lamp My friend Shruti, who took the class a year ago, told a career fair recruiter about programming in 8051 assembly in 6.115. To which the recruiter responded, “Are you   you worked with 8051s? …because those are really old.” After roasting the recruiter and the general tendency for men to question whether feminine presenting people actually know what they’re working on, we laughed about Steve’s philosophy of rejecting modernity. The 8051 microcontroller family was invented in 1980, not long before Steve started his undergrad at MIT in 1983. As a result, 6.115 hasn’t changed much since Steve first started teaching it. This was confirmed by a conversation with someone who took 6.115 over ten years ago. What sounded like the biggest difference between then and now was that they had to lug around a lab kit stored in a wooden box about waist height, while we got the luxury of suspicious looking suitcases. The  class website 
best: ⁠ 04 well yea duh, because it's in his own words This class is not particularly about learning how a specific microcontroller is programmed, or about designing circuits, or about wiring chips together. We do a little of all of these things, but our real goal is to introduce you to a palette of tools and techniques that let you build what you can imagine. These techniques are much more general than the details of a single processor or programming language. Chips come and go, but successful approaches for engineering design have a life that spans many iterations of a particular technology. When he says “palette of tools and techniques,” I think a lot of it is learning how to  . At one point a TA asked me, “Have you used a multimeter before or are you more of a 6-3?” Ah yes, the two genders. The class was pretty split between seasoned hardware enthusiasts and 6-3 software
 
bros ⁠ 05 used in a gender neutral way here The labs taught you how to… by just making you do it. My friend Alicia asked a TA if there was supposed to be a schematic attached to the lab handout, to which the TA responded, “oh you’re supposed to draw one yourself.” We learned that microcontrollers and other electronic components all came with datasheets, which held answers to how to wire and use them. Figuring out the circuits was one thing, but making them work was another. I’ve always thought of hardware debugging to be some sort of black magic— how do you figure out which one of your countless components is borked? I couldn’t just throw print statements everywhere in the same way that I would with a software program. It turned out that the hardware equivalent of print statements was using an oscilloscope, a device that plots the voltage of an electrical signal over time. I learned how to predict what the shape of the electrical signal should look like through reading datasheets and intuition built over time. If there were discrepancies between my expectations and the oscilloscope reading, then I’ve (probably) found the bug, whether that be incorrect wirings or a blown out chip. As I did this more and more, the scattered pieces of what I managed to gather from lectures started to come together. Everything about the labs fostered collaboration. The office hours were severely
 
understaffed ⁠ 06 shoutout to the TA/LAs who overstayed shifts by over 3 hours ;-;  were in this together. don’t ask how much time and how many people i had to ask for help to get this stupid LCD screen to work The last three weeks of the semester were dedicated to the ✨final project✨, where we could make anything that integrated hardware and software systems and used a Cypress PSoC development board. I decided to make a mechanical DoodleJump out of addressable LEDs (the same RGB strip lights that you might put up in your room) because I wanted an excuse to play DoodleJump for “research purposes.” The PSoC (pronounced “pee sock”) is the most poorly documented development board known to mankind, which we had the sheer luck of using because Cypress funded a significant portion of 6.115. Maybe that was the point though. Because the PSoC had very few prewritten libraries, we had the
 
immense honor and privilege ⁠ 07 /s It turns out that like many electronic systems, RGB strip lights are controlled by a series of square waves. A square wave of a certain timing is interpreted as a 0 bit, and a square wave of another timing is interpreted as a 1 bit. see how keeping the signal at high for a tiny bit shorter gives you a 0 and a tiny bit longer gives you a 1? A sequence of 24 bits determines the color of a single LED — the first 8 determine the red value, the second 8 determine the green value, and third 8 determine the blue value. To control multiple LEDs in a strip, you would just send a second set of 24 bits to control the second LED, and so on and so forth. After five hours of staring at square pulses lasting fractions of a microsecond on an oscilloscope, I …*drumroll*… turned on an LED! I only have Cypress to thank for this riveting learning opportunity. Here’s the rest of my project! If you haven’t played the mobile game DoodleJump before, you tilt your phone to get the little jumper dude to jump on platforms of increasing heights. In my mechanical version, the player instead uses clicky pen controllers retrofit with parts I machined on a lathe to control a jumping red dot. If the player dot jumps to another side of the LED cube, a motor spins 90 degrees such that the player dot is always on the side facing you. I had handwritten a beautiful seven page report documenting the process in my lab notebook, but I forgot to take pictures before turning it in. The following picture carousel includes the hardware schematic, software flowchart, and mechanical CAD drawing for you nerds who care: Previous Next Here’s a video of my jumpy boi in action: In my first draft of this blog, I wrote something along the lines of “6.115 taught me how to persevere through things that are hard.” But I already knew how to persevere. I’ve already made it through countless classes whose problems set my brain cells on fire prior to taking 6.115. I can confidently say that everyone here is good at persevering, by the nature of how academically and emotionally demanding MIT is. Instead, I’ll say that 6.115   my ability to persevere, except this time I knew not to beat myself up in the process. While I couldn’t resist mentioning in every other paragraph just how many hours I spent on certain parts of this class, sometimes those hours led to nowhere. Sometimes my system wouldn’t work no matter how much I probed and poked at it. Of course, it was disappointing to admit to the lab grader that your system didn’t work, but so what? I know that given enough time, I am capable of solving the problems that I wasn’t able to this time around because I have collected a spectacular palette of tools and techniques over the last semester. And if I encountered a similar system or problem in a research or workplace or other Real Adult setting, I’d know exactly where to start. #"6.115 rules!"

I was a high achiever since a young age just because I thought school by itself was really boring. The challenge of winning a bunch of stuff made the whole experience more bearable. But I wasn’t always a perfectionist, not until the past several years. Perfectionism and high-achiever-ism go hand in hand whenever people discuss either of those topics, but there’s a distinct gap between the philosophies behind them when it comes to how someone confronts failure. The goal of high achievement is to reach a lofty bar that you set for yourself. It’s a challenge. The goal of perfectionism is more similar to a survivalist mindset. If you mess up, you’re screwed, no matter what. Mix that with high achiever tendencies, and that shiny bar you’ve set for yourself becomes the standard for survival, whatever you’re trying to survive against. If you don’t hit that significantly above-average point, you’re so screwed. You’re meat. For whatever reason you’ve made up to justify that. It’s hard to say with confidence that perfectionism is purely evil, because I do believe there are cases when it can do good. I’m also not implying “high-achieving good, perfectionism bad.” The thing is, perfectionism is not the only path to success, neither is it the most “valid” path. Perfectionism wants you to believe that though, and it guilt trips you into believing that you settled for mediocrity if you go a different path that is riddled with setbacks and failures. Once you reap the rewards of perfectionism though, it’s hard to break away from it because you no longer feel safe without it and that you’re going to give yourself to catastrophic failure anytime soon. When I say I experienced a lot of failure in my sophomore year, it’s not a dramatic exaggeration of otherwise satisfactory results. I wasn’t prepared for the amount of shit I was going to eat, sometimes served on a high-speed conveyor belt all at once. I straight-up failed a class in my fall semester that is required for my major, so I had to retake it. I failed not just one exam, but a few exams along the way. I would’ve failed another class, if it wasn’t for the incredibly generous curve. from Wiktionary I wish I could say I was a tough guy. I took that failure really personally. I cried a lot, often in my room or empty classrooms on campus, with people sometimes walking in and then awkwardly shuffling back out. I’ve contemplated several times about running off to a cabin to become a writer (which wouldn’t really solve my problems, but I could dream). “Imposter syndrome” is a common buzzword nowadays, but it’s a good way to describe how I felt. I really couldn’t understand why I was at MIT. The hardest fact to reconcile with was that I put a lot of time and effort into these, even if the grades told a completely different story. That was the most devastating blow. As if the coursework alone wasn’t hard enough to trudge through, the drop in motivation that followed put a crushing weight on my shoulders. If  that  was what my full effort looked like, then I didn’t see a point in moving any further. The universe seemed to be telling me that I made the wrong choice and all of the dreams I had were just illusions that were meant to be broken. The universe is just teaching the same lesson that every organism must endure during their short lives on Earth. “The path to success doesn’t open by eliminating failure. If you want to succeed in the things you want to do, you must learn the art of eating shit and move on.” I unfortunately haven’t completely learned the art of eating shit, so I’m not going to preach advice to you that I don’t understand myself. I can say how it’s affected me though. I got a bruised ego, for one. hahahaha On a lighter note, I’ve also become more sure about what exactly I want to aim for in the near future. Basically, in the face of utter despair, what’s the one thing that keeps me moving? I wrote back in March  that I rediscovered robotics as a potential career path, and conjuring up mental images of robots helped me get through grueling coursework way more effectively than a mental image of a mega-lucrative SWE job that I thought I was supposed to aim for, because every other successful CS major was. I think it would’ve taken me much longer to reach that conclusion if I didn’t endure those failures in sophomore year. In acknowledging that failure can happen to anybody, it’s also deepened my respect for the people I admire. I used to think, “They’re amazing because they achieved this.” Now I think, “They’re amazing because they achieved this,  .” Although I think I’ll still fall back on perfectionist tendencies every so often, I’ve decided that I don’t want to grow up into the kind of person who uses perfectionism to dictate how they lead their lives—whether this is someone whose fear of failure holds them back from what they want to do, or someone who is as unnecessarily stern on the people around them as they are on themselves. I’ve been both kinds of people, and I don’t think either experience was worth it. Most of all, I don’t want to be like DJ “Suffering from Success” Khaled when he lost his Number One position on the US charts to Tyler, the Creator, and he threw a whole hissy fit about what real music is. I haven’t been That Person before, and I’m going to keep it that way. As important as it is to try my best at whatever I’m doing, I’m just trying my best to eat shit when it does get served so I can move on and work towards what I want to do, and not to let my disappointment turn me into a bitter tightwad. By the way, I’m still here. The world didn’t end because I failed.

why is ai so bad at making hands? Recently, I read something by a fiction writer that went something like,  As somebody who has spent many years learning about the craft of writing, I certainly understand the frustration—if my goal was to produce well-written sentences, then perhaps the advent of ChatGPT would mean that all my efforts had been wasted. But AI-generated writing doesn’t bother me, and if somebody were to create a story generated by AI “written in Rona’s style” or trained on my publicly available work, I wouldn’t mind—I’d be amused, more than anything else. Of course, this is only  reaction, and certainly other creatives might not feel the same (and a quick glimpse at Twitter would prove that they  feel the same). Artists’ ire is two-pronged.   artificial intelligence poses a professional threat. I’m privileged in that I never expected to rely on writing as a steady source of income, and if everything goes as planned, by June, I will hold bachelor’s degrees in mathematics and computer science from MIT. I’m uncertain how I would feel if this weren’t the case, so it’s possible that, under the stress of economic insecurity, my opinion would be vastly different, but my current belief on this topic is: AI is absolutely a professional hazard to artists, as it is a hazard to software engineers, data analysts, executive assistants, and a menagerie of other professions. It is a hazard in the same sense ride-sharing was a hazard to taxi drivers and photography was a hazard to painters. All this is to say, technological innovation reshapes our processes and systems, and it inevitably threatens current jobs. This does not mean we shouldn’t move forward. But even if you can agree with that notion on an intellectual, abstract level, that doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly stressful to see your career prospects shrivel up. One of my friends predicts that AI will lead to widespread unemployment, which will bring about civil unrest—and while I hope this won’t be the case, I can certainly understand the underlying rage that comes with losing a future you worked so hard to achieve. artificial intelligence is creatively humiliating. It can  to see a machine churn out a derivative of your work, to know that a soulless language model trained on snippets of   soul to produce said derivative work. I have limited knowledge of copyright law and how data is used within these models, so I can’t comment on the legal ramifications here (and I suspect that the government will move to enact new legislature in this direction). I also don’t want to undermine other people’s emotional responses, so I only speak for myself here. I don’t quite see my work as an extension of myself, or as a deep excavation of my inner life, or perhaps the more accurate statement here is that I view the  of writing as distinctly different from the  of writing. Translating the confusing, limitless galaxies within me—that process is intimate, a conversation between the page and me, and that journey won’t disappear simply because a computer can generate pretty paragraphs. The joy of reaching for an apt metaphor, of conjuring a visceral image, of understanding myself more fully—that remains regardless. Once those words are written, once they exist as separate entities beyond myself, they are for the reader. And if the reader is a robot that wants to feed upon my dangling participles only to spit out an imitation, that’s okay too. here

As we  conclude our work with the Class of 2027 , and turn our attention to the class of 2028 and beyond, I want to take a moment —   alongside President Kornbluth 
explain ⁠ 01 In addition to the main text of the post, if you see any text highlighted in transparent red — like “explain” is, here — you can hover over it on desktop (or tap, on mobile) to see a related annotation on the right hand side of the post (or inline, on mobile; note that the desktop/mobile UI is triggered by the width of your browser). The annotations are numbered, and repeated as endnotes at the bottom of the blog. We use this feature to add additional commentary, evidence, and background information throughout the post, in case readers want to explore more context than we could reasonably fit into the main body of text. We do encourage you to read the footnotes; we’ve done our best to show our work in them. how a diverse student body advances our education Last fall, the Supreme Court  heard arguments two cases same plaintiff 
expected sometime in June. ⁠ 02 The Supreme Court does not announce when it will release its decisions in particular cases in advance, so we don’t know when this will be. However, decisions are typically released by the end of June, and the Court usually announces in advance which days it will be posting decisions (without specifying which cases will be decided that day). You can see a calendar of these dates — and copies of opinions, once they are posted — at <a href="http://scotusblog.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCOTUSblog</a>, and follow along at home just like we are. wrote the amicus brief MIT submitted Affirmative action is legally complicated, politically controversial, and widely misunderstood. Under the currently controlling precedent,   (2003), universities are allowed to consider race   to the extent —  and only for the   —  that it is “narrowly tailored…to
 
further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body” ⁠ 03 In other words, we cannot preferentially select students of certain races in order to redress historic or contemporary disadvantage, nor are we permitted to mechanistically give ‘points’ to students solely because they are from under-represented backgrounds despite other deficiencies in their application. Sweeping measures like those — rooted in attempts to broadly redress inequality and advance justice — have been legally prohibited for decades. As the law stands now, the only reason we may narrowly consider race for individual students in our process is because of the cumulative benefits of diversity on the student body — and the wider world — benefits that have been recognized in the Court’s precedent for more than half a century. 
“critical mass” ⁠ 04 ‘Critical mass’ is a metaphor — best known in nuclear physics — that suggests a minimum necessary amount of material to support a self-sustaining chain reaction capable of generating tremendous additional power. In our work, it means we cannot have quotas or targets for any racial or ethnic group, but we can take steps to pursue minimally sufficient populations to collectively advance our educational mission. In our <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/policies/#diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversity statement,</a> we try to give meaning to ‘critical mass’ as such: “Every student should feel that ‘there are people like me here’ and ‘there are people different from me here.’ No student should feel isolated; all students should come into contact with members of other groups and experience them as colleagues with valuable ideas and insights.”  if they can demonstrate that
 
no other workable methods can achieve that critical mass. ⁠ 05 In other words, under current law, if there <em>were</em> other, race-neutral, methods to achieve a diverse student body sufficient to produce these educational benefits, we would be required to use those instead, and required to <em>not</em> consider race. For many years, we have
 
admitted students to MIT consistent with the approach prescribed by  .  ⁠ 06 As we say in <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/policies/#diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our policies</a>, “In undergraduate recruitment and selection, MIT looks at each application holistically, taking account of many different factors that have shaped a student’s experience, including their racial, ethnic, social, economic, and educational context. We believe it is crucial for the successful future of our world to educate people from every walk of life.” This and other statements on the relevance of diversity to MIT’s educational mission have been developed in close consultation with <a href="https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/committee-undergraduate-admissions-and-financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUAFA,</a> our student-faculty advisory committee. In this blog post, I use “affirmative action” and “race-conscious admissions” interchangeably, as the litigation does. The former is a general term describing a broad class of approaches that intentionally seek diversity; the latter is how we do it in our specific professional context. 
considerable investment in our outreach and recruitment programs, ⁠ 07 We put a lot of thought and effort into trying to identify and support students from under-represented and/or under-served backgrounds who are <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/what-we-look-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong matches for the MIT education</a>. This includes (but is not limited to) <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnering with MIT summer programs</a>, targeting travel to regions and high schools that would benefit most from our physical presence, and working with our alumni to run affinity programs like <a href="https://wise.mitadmissions.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WISE</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9t8qKHWKv/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sin LiMITe</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CcIhUR5OYne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ebony Affair</a> that help students learn about, and find community at, MIT. We also work with well-matched partner organizations like <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuestBridge</a>, <a href="https://collegehorizons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College Horizons</a>, and more to help their students learn about what MIT is like. Meanwhile, our generous need-based, full-need, no-loan financial aid ensures that everyone who is admitted to MIT can afford to attend; we <a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/#:~:text=Register%20to%20vote%C2%A0%E2%86%92-,BY%20THE%20NUMBERS,-TOTAL%20MIT%20SCHOLARSHIPS">distributed more than $153 million in scholarship grants to our undergraduates last year alone,</a> and about a third of our undergraduates paid no tuition at all. 
progressively more diverse ⁠ 08 What it means for a class to be “more diverse” is a complex and contested question. For the purposes of this post, we mean we work to improve the recruitment and enrollment of well-matched and academically prepared under-represented minority students — as well as other students who are less commonly present in our applicant pool — to the point where MIT obtains a critical mass sufficient to provide the educational benefits of diversity consistent with <em>Grutter</em>. Demographically speaking, there is no majority race or ethnicity at MIT, and a majority of our students are either <a href="https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/immigration-kind-oxygen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immigrants</a> or the child of at least one immigrant. Of course, diversity across <em>many</em> axes of identity, experience, and perspective is required to achieve educational benefits consistent with our mission, which is why we actively pursue all of them in our recruitment and selection, including through our partnership with <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuestBridge</a>, our membership in the <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/3-questions-stuart-schmill-mit-admissions-stars-college-network-0404">STARS Network</a>, and many other initiatives — including our <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/career/rotc/">ROTC programs</a>, some of which are the oldest in the country — that tend to broadly attract people from many backgrounds and worldviews to apply. It is the combination of diversity across all these features of our community that collectively generate its robustly diverse character. The reason this blog post focuses principally on the question of racial and ethnic diversity because that is the issue presently before the Court. 
simultaneously more academically successful ⁠ 09 For example, steadily rising graduation rates across all demographic groups, as well as steadily falling numbers of students receiving academic warnings or review at the beginning and end of the term, over the last decade or so, just in terms of things we can straightforwardly measure. We also see that strength in our <a href="https://capd.mit.edu/post-graduateandsummer/">postgraduate outcomes across graduate school and employment</a>. As our Provost Cynthia Barnhart <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-provost-cynthia-barnhart-mit-community-excellence-0519">recently said</a>, “MIT has been working to broaden our community’s diversity for at least four decades. If work like this threatened MIT’s excellence or its reputation, we would surely have seen the impact by now....Our student body is both more diverse and more accomplished than ever. And, each year, MIT is well represented among the recipients of prestigious awards and honors. It is clear that our increasing diversity is not hampering excellence at MIT.” — class profile — 
largest proportion of under-represented minority students in our history ⁠ 10 For the purposes of interpreting the descriptive statistics reported on the class profile, we adopt the standard convention of using “under-represented minority students” to count Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students, who are historically under-represented in STEM education. This is a crude standard, and one that has been (rightly) criticized for subsuming other minority groups — particularly <a href="http://asianamerican.mit.edu/recs/">Asian-American students</a> — into monoliths, as well as for sidestepping the sovereign status of Indigenous peoples; we acknowledge the <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/h1w0nbqp/release/3)">limitations of these ways we currently count people</a>. However, I want to be clear that the bluntness of these reporting standards does not represent the subtlety of our admissions process, where we regularly make fine distinctions based on the individual experience of students as evident in their essays, activities, and other aspects of their application. Meanwhile, admissions is part of a broad group of MIT students, faculty, and staff working to develop more appropriate and fine-grained ways to collect and represent the complexity of individual identity without reducing the power of collective claims. I hope more will come from this group over the next year. —  
a common standard of academic excellence. ⁠ 11 There is a widespread myth that practicing race-conscious admissions means necessarily compromising standards of academic preparation on behalf of under-represented minority students. I want to make it clear that this myth is false, and we reject it utterly. As we have said for many years, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/diversity-or-merit/">there is no inherent tradeoff between diversity and merit</a>; the considerable leverage of race-conscious admissions comes from our current ability consider diversity when picking among comparably prepared applicants whom we believe are all ready for an MIT education. To use a math metaphor, the utility of race-conscious admissions is generated by the difference in demographic denominators: because of <a href="https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Inequities-in-Advanced-Coursework-Whats-Driving-Them-and-What-Leaders-Can-Do-January-2019.pdf">widespread and systemic educational inequality in the K-12 system</a>, there are typically many fewer students from under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds with demonstrated academic preparation for MIT in our applicant pool. So we have to be very intentional in our recruitment and selection to identify and enroll such students when there are — for structural reasons — fewer of them applying to MIT, in order to achieve the diversity that we think provides educational benefits to the Institute. 
as we have practiced it under the guidance of Grutter, ⁠ 12 As I said earlier, our ability to narrowly consider race under the <em>Grutter</em> framework is what has enabled us to enroll extremely strong under-represented students despite their relative under-representation. At bottom, what seems to be at stake in this case — based on oral arguments, since we haven’t seen the decision yet — is the question of whether or not the diversity of the MIT undergraduate body remains a legitimate goal we can pursue through the selection process, and — if it still is — what steps we can take to achieve diversity given these systemic challenges. 
essential to achieving these outcomes simultaneously. ⁠ 13 The reason it is essential is the same reason <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we restored our SAT/ACT requirement last year</a>: because the judicious use of testing (as one empirically important measure of academic preparation, at least for our specific education) combined with the narrowly tailored consideration of race (to help select a diverse class from among many well-prepared applicants) allows us to craft a class that is <em>both</em> academically robust <em>and</em> demographically diverse. We are not the only institution for whom this is true: in their <a href="https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/the-efficiency-of-race-neutral-alternatives-to-race-based-affirmative-action-evidence-from-chicagos-exam-schools/">detailed study of Chicago’s exam schools</a>, MIT professors Glenn Ellison and Parag Pathak have shown that “prohibitions on affirmative action policies that explicitly consider race” introduced “significant efficiency costs” in the selection process — reducing both socioeconomic diversity <strong>and</strong> academic preparation simultaneously — and that no race-neutral (e.g. socioeconomic or geographic) methods restored that diversity, a finding consistent with other studies I review below. It may be that the Supreme Court upholds its own
 
recently affirmed precedent; ⁠ 14 The <em>Grutter</em> framework was reaffirmed as good law by the Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas_(2016)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as recently as 2016</a>. Meanwhile, the lower courts concluded at trial that Harvard and UNC were acting legally within the <em>Grutter</em> framework, before the current Supreme Court decided to take up these cases. 
all of the accompanying benefits that flow to our students, the Institute, and the world. ⁠ 15 In addition to our <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/policies/#diversity:~:text=Statement%20on%20the%20role%20of%20diversity%20in%20MIT%E2%80%99s%20educational%20mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on the role of diversity in MIT’s educational mission</a>, I would like to draw your attention again to our <a href="https://ogc.mit.edu/latest/mit-submits-supreme-court-amicus-brief-harvardunc-admissions-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amicus brief</a>, filed jointly with Stanford, IBM, and Aeris Communications, which addresses (1) the vital role that diversity, including racial diversity, plays in achieving the educational missions of institutions of higher education for all students, with particular focus on STEM fields; (2) the importance of diversity to our nation’s success in the global economy; and (3) why consideration of race as one among many factors in the admission of students to selective STEM degree programs is essential to achieve these critical educational goals. However, it may be that the Supreme Court chooses to further restrict — or fully prohibit — our ability to do so. If the Court rules in a way that constrains how universities may compose their communities, our  commitment achieve — 
flagship public universities ⁠ 16 For example, in his <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727272300021X">landmark study of the University of California system</a> — with a dataset spanning more than 2 million applicants over nearly 30 years — Zachary Bleemer estimates that passing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_California_Proposition_209">California Proposition 209</a> in 1996 led to a decline in Black enrollment at its most selective campuses by more than 60%, and that no race-neutral initiatives have restored diversity to prior levels at those campuses. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/kidder_paper.pdf">a separate study by Kidder and Gándara</a> found that “in spite of high investments of both human and financial resources in many areas ⌈with⌋ an array of race-neutral alternatives, including outreach, partnerships with high minority schools, academic preparation programs (some of which it invented), and targeted information and recruitment efforts… a percent plan ⌈and⌋ comprehensive review of vast numbers of applications…modified admissions criteria…special attention to low-income students ⌈and⌋ one of the most generous need-based financial aid programs in the country...the ⌈University of California system⌋ has never recovered the same level of diversity that it had before the loss of affirmative action,” which has remained most true at its most selective campuses to this day. 
attendant negative consequences for their communities. ⁠ 17 In a <a href="https://record.umich.edu/articles/u-m-files-amicus-brief-in-support-of-harvard-and-unc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compelling amicus brief</a>, the University of Michigan describes the effect of the 2006 ban on their community: “Despite persistent, vigorous, and varied efforts to increase student-body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means...the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously...especially among the most-underrepresented groups, Black and Native American students, whose enrollment has fallen by 44% and 90%, respectively...fully one quarter of underrepresented minority students surveyed indicated they felt they did not “belong” at U-M, a 66% increase over the last decade...U-M’s more than 15-year-long experiment in race-neutral admissions helps to establish that racial diversity in student enrollment, and the compelling government interest in the resulting educational benefits, cannot be adequately realized at selective institutions without taking race into account as one factor among many in admissions decisions.” Meanwhile, <a href="https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/affirmative-action-mismatch-and-economic-mobility-after-california%E2%80%99s-proposition-209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another study by Professor Bleemer finds that</a> — contrary to the “mismatch hypothesis,” which holds that affirmative action negatively impacts under-represented students because they are necessarily unprepared for the college to which they were admitted — Proposition 209 had substantial negative economic and educational impacts on under-represented Californians, with none of the supposed academic or professional benefits predicted by the mismatch hypothesis. The reason communities changed in those states  — —  
crucial tool ⁠ 18 Indeed, as the research I mentioned above demonstrates, and the <em>Grutter </em>precedent demands, it is still the <strong>only </strong>effective tool for the task of achieving robust racial and ethnic diversity. 
goals ⁠ 19 Like shelter, and warmth. 
certain tools ⁠ 20 Like a hammer, or a saw. 
goals for each class, ⁠ 21 Like robust diversity, and academic excellence. 
we also use tools to achieve them. ⁠ 22 Like <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/we-are-reinstating-our-sat-act-requirement-for-future-admissions-cycles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standardized testing</a>, and race-conscious admissions. 
if one of our important tools is taken away, ⁠ 23 As I said above, the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the cases in question; it may yet come to pass that we can continue to use our processes and practices to make an MIT that is as broadly diverse as the nation and world we hope to serve. I’m sharing these concerns, and this research, ahead of time because I want to illuminate the potential scale and complexity of the challenge that would face MIT should the Court further restrict our abilities to achieve the kind of diversity that advances our educational mission. MIT is full of brilliant people who love to take on and solve hard problems, and our admissions office is full of incredibly dedicated and hardworking staff. However, we cannot ignore the data that shows difficult it has been for other similarly situated institutions to pursue diversity to be when their ability to consider race has been curtailed. The fundamentally unequal and inequitable distribution of resources linked to race and ethnicity has deep roots in the United States, and affirmative action itself provides at best a patch for any given institution. There are no easy solutions or innovative hacks to the challenge of true equality and justice; it requires transformative change. 
our values ⁠ 24 As we put it in the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT Values Statement</a>, “Valuing potential over pedigree, we know that talent and good ideas can come from anywhere – and we value one another’s contributions in every role. Together we possess uncommon strengths, and we shoulder the responsibility to use them with wisdom and care for humanity and the natural world.” 
qualities of our applicants ⁠ 25 We are particularly concerned that some may interpret any future significant changes in the demographic composition of the MIT student body as a referendum on whether students admitted in the past really ‘belonged’ at MIT, as has been the experience in California and Michigan, according to their amicus briefs. So another reason I am writing this blogpost is to reaffirm, in the strongest possible terms, my unshakeable conviction that every student we have admitted belongs here, and that their academic excellence and individual contributions to campus life demonstrate those <em>bona fides</em> beyond a shadow of a doubt. I think this is widely understood at MIT — people here know how hard it is, and how great our students are — but it may not be as salient to members of the broader public, and I think it deserves to be said. In the public discussion of these court cases, it has been suggested by some that the educational benefits of diversity are diffuse and abstract, but I have felt them personally and concretely. As a Jewish kid from an immigrant neighborhood in Queens  — Ladino — 
We were all so different from each other, ⁠ 26 It was the first time I had been surrounded by so many non-Jewish students (and so many students from all across the country); meanwhile, for some of my fellow campers, I was the first Jewish person they had ever met. 
my fellow campers opened my eyes ⁠ 27 And because I was surrounded by so many different people, it was a much more valuable and life changing experience than if I had stayed in a program closer to home, with people more like me. Later, when I was applying to college,
 
the dynamic diversity of MIT drew me to the place ⁠ 28 Indeed, in survey after survey, our admitted students tell us that a primary reason they choose MIT over peer schools is the community, in all of its colorful heterogeneity. This is true for students of all backgrounds: whether under-represented or not, the vast majority of our students cite the diversity of the MIT community, specifically, as a strongly positive factor in their decision to enroll. 
a boat full of athletes from across the country and the world; ⁠ 29 A few of them had been rowing for years, but most had never touched an oar before; by the end of the season, they would be rowing together in total harmony. 
progressively more diverse generations of alumni ⁠ 30 It is perhaps worth noting, here, that <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/help/faq/legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we do not have a legacy preference.</a> 
represent the Institute to prospective students. ⁠ 31 In that role, I saw how both our alumni and our applicants were mutually inspired by their differences and similarities, as I once was all the way back in Wichita. Over the course of my 40 years here, as our doors have opened to more people from broader experiences, our education has grown stronger as our community has grown more richly diverse, at the same time and for that very reason. Indeed,
 
because diverse teams are better at spotting and solving problems, ⁠ 32 This is a consistent finding across a variety of disciplines in the social sciences, from <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421787">investigating the origins of good ideas</a>, to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15534225/">generating better solutions to novel problems</a>, to <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/2wu7aft8/release/3">collecting more accurately grounded data</a>, to <a href="https://hbr.org/1996/09/making-differences-matter-a-new-paradigm-for-managing-diversity">managing teams of collaborators</a>, to <a href="https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/04/03/is-the-oculus-rift-sexist.html">being able to detect when technologies are working or breaking for different users</a>. As the late sociologist Susan Leigh Star wrote in her <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00027649921955326" class="broken_link">classic study of infrastructure</a>, technical problems should always be understood as <em>socially relational</em>: “For the person in a wheelchair, the stairs and doorjamb in front of a building are not ⌈useful tools⌋, but barriers...One person’s infrastructure is another’s ⌈difficulty⌋.” mission 
“advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.” ⁠ 33 As Provost Barnhart <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-provost-cynthia-barnhart-mit-community-excellence-0519">said last fall</a>, “What is powerful about our community is that we are bound by our collective mission and set apart by our individual experiences. I believe that the more we bring together people with different perspectives, experiences, and approaches — the more each of us learns and is able to do our best work. That is why a community of diverse, talented, and passionate people is critical to living up to our mission.” In addition to our <a href="https://ogc.mit.edu/latest/mit-submits-supreme-court-amicus-brief-harvardunc-admissions-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aforementioned amicus brief</a> coauthored with major corporations attesting to the importance of diversity in STEM education and workforce development, I would also draw your attention to the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/232539/20220801205901633_20-1199%20Harvard%20FINAL%20Revised.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. government’s brief on behalf of the military academies</a>, arguing that “highly qualified and broadly diverse” leadership is critical — both within and beyond the military — to improve both credibility and performance. Given MIT’s longstanding role in educating future leaders across industry, the military, and other sectors of the economy and institutions, we are acutely aware of how the composition of our student body affects systems downstream of us. Nearly sixty years ago, my predecessor B. Alden Thresher wrote  College Admissions and the Public Interest 
full of striking insights ⁠ 34 For example, Thresher presciently reminds members of our profession to never disregard or suppress “education’s greatest asset: the inherent diversity of talents with which nature has endowed individuals.” Thresher considered diversity “the chief source of progress” in both natural and human affairs; indeed, the driving force of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-progressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressions</a> seen at MIT for many decades now. observes 
humbling quote when I consider the constraints on what we can actually do ⁠ 35 People often ask admissions officers a version of the question: “what is it like to determine someone’s future?” But this is not really what we do, since every prospective student passes through our process already traveling on a trajectory set by all prior opportunities they have (or haven’t) had well before their application reaches our desk. All we can hope to do is use the weight of our institution to positively inflect their flight, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist">gravity assist</a> that accelerates a spacecraft already shooting through the stars. shape of the river Again, we don’t know yet what the Supreme Court will say, and even once they issue their decision, it will take time to interpret and implement its practical meaning. Immediately after the judgment is handed down, we will turn our full attention to understanding its impact on our work. In the meantime, I want to assure you that, whatever the ultimate disposition of the decision, our commitment to a vibrantly diverse and academically excellent MIT will remain undimmed; the North Star by which we will steer through uncertain waters ahead.

i felt the need to have some sort of memorial service to commemorate the death of east campus and the death of this room in particular 62h306 today i remember the people who lived in this room before me of the several dozen years that this room has lived i’ve only been here to bear witness a small part, only trace a quarter of it i don’t know your full history, but i do know enough to have gotten to know you i’ve done enough in this room, placed enough things, learned enough about it, to have formed this connection i know you’re not real, you’re not living, you’re not sentient, you won’t ever hear this even though i’m saying this inside you right now i felt the need to do this because i will miss you, in a way this has been the one place i’ve stayed in the longest (without considering my parents’ place) i stayed here for, in total, two years, which isn’t even really that long in the scale of places i’ve stayed in but the fact that it has been that long, and it’s way longer compared to anything else, is kind of a big deal to me this is just to say, i’m gonna miss you, h306 i’m gonna miss east campus, and all of it’s weirdness, all the art painted on its walls all the hidden passages, the memories made by dozens and dozens of people before me in a way it reminds me of suzume, i guess, in how you have to think about how this place was used before you, all the memories made by people in this soon-to-be-abandoned building because a place is never really about the place, it’s about the people who live in the place, the people who do things in the place, and now all of those people are gone, and i will be one of the last to leave i’ll be one of the last to leave i guess this is also the conclusion to me graduating, or of my time in mit, because after i leave ec i won’t be on campus for a while i’ll be in et, and the next time i’ll be back will be for a therapy appointment but, whatever i don’t know why i felt the need to do this, but i’m doing it anyway and i i’ll miss you i’ll miss this and i’m very sad about graduating, and i don’t know how to express that in words even though i think i’m normally a very articulate person it feels like there’s this hole it feels like, when you’re buliding up a tower of lego bricks, but you only have enough to go up two of the sides, and you can’t bring up the middle to be the same height as the rest, and you end up with this weird-looking structure, and in a sense i feel like my whole life has been this weird-looking structure where i’ve been leaving lots of gaps everywhere because i can’t find the pieces to fill them with because that’s how it’s been it feels like i’m grieving, even though i know that no one is dying even though i know i could see people again, if i wanted to even though for some of the people i said goodbye to, it might be the last time i said goodbye to them i have no idea how humanity has a whole hasn’t figured out this medicine you could take to stop feeling grief there are no stickers that i could place on memories to save them the closer and closer i zoom into this fractal the more and more hurt i feel even in the infinite tapestry of beautiful memories and color that people have made inside here i’m sorry goodbye

drawing class Every Tuesday evening, right as the sun was setting in the horizon, I’d embark on a long bike ride over to the complete opposite side of campus.  At Building W97, the Theater Arts building, I took 21M.601 (Drawing for Designers). It’s one of my favorite classes so far.  There are other bloggers who have written about this class, including  Waly  (who focused on gesture drawing),  Afeefah  (who shared their favorite pieces), and  Danny and Allan  (who commented on the art class scene as a whole at MIT). I focus more on the struggle of drawing, a selection of my pieces, and how drawing connects to  . From 7 to 10pm, the class was a long three hours, but it was always so worth it. As a class, we had one goal: learn to apply   and   to capture reality. I liked the bare bones premise because I could focus better. Additional artistic factors like color, paint, imagination, and so on would’ve made art as a whole more overwhelming, at least I know it would in the beginning for me. Instead, our class used mostly-monotone pencil, crayon, and charcoal. It was approachable: here are a few tools, now draw what you see.  being ~bad~ at drawing I must preface that I never thought of myself as a drawer.  In fact, for the larger part of my life, I’ve thought of myself as very bad at drawing. Like, anytime I tried to depict people, I’d end up with wonky stick figures.  It was always a bit frustrating having images exist so vividly in my mind—so clear, they felt real—but they would get lost in translation to the page. One instance of this happened in  high school robotics, where I tried to explain a
 
DR4B linkage ⁠ 01 double-reverse 4-bar linkage! they have such sleek movement. i loved building these. more info <a href="https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/hardware/lifts/dr4b">here</a>. I’ve enjoyed abstract painting, but largely because it’s hard to mess up “abstract,” if not impossible. It was safe. Reality was always difficult to do justice.  Basically, I’ve always wanted to learn to draw, and this class was an opportunity I eagerly decided to take on. It seems this want to draw is shared amongst many MIT students, because this is one of the few classes that requires you to apply for it through a Google form (FYI: most MIT classes you can just register for, no questions asked). Gosh, I essentially wrote a love letter to drawing in my application. I badly wanted to take this class, and am so grateful I was able to.  things i drew Each class began with a demonstration of drawing techniques, followed by timed drawing prompts where the class applied what we learned.  Behind all of the polished class drawings, there exists many warm-ups and drafts. Every class ended off with a final piece that would be added to our portfolio. Here is a selection of mine: inanimate objects Previous Next animate objects Live models came in to pose for class a few times! It was really cool to work with real people. I wasn’t allowed to take photos, so I won’t be adding any references along with the drawings, but you get the idea. Previous Next After one class, my friend Charlotte W. ’23 asked me what felt different between drawing a real human vs. a not-real human. This was our conversation: Previous Next 
K: it was soooocoolllllleeeee. okay so you see them breathe. and get to keenly observe the way a breath translates to subtle movements in the rest of the body. the guy moved around to a bunch of different strange positions and we had 1 minute each for this one 20 minute warmup. I could go on but those are the main things I really enjoyed 
C: I feel like it’s cool to notice so many little things. With drawing it general. It seems like it teaches you to take notice of things most people just rush by 
K: it’s a visual romanticization of life 
C: It makes sense that you would enjoy/be good at it because you romanticize (stealing your word) things already 
K: awwwh thanks 🥰. it reminds me of a convo i had with dourmashkin recently where we talked about how he comes up with such great examples. he just watches life through such a physics lens and appreciates all the little seemingly-fleeting things like how a paper delicately floats down after being brushed off a table or the electric shock we sometimes give to each other. he really loves this stuff it was so endearing to hear him gush 
C: Awwww I feel like this is a common physics major thing lolol. Romanticizing the little things once you realize how complicated they really are. Or maybe a STEM thing 
K: omgyeah stem thing. or really any academic thing. everything is really complicated and trying to understand those things feels like a form of appreciation/love rooms Previous Next self portraits For one assignment, I had to produce two self portraits. I decided to draw a literal piece (that spoke more to the  ego id superego Previous Next master copies The name captures these assignments well: I had to copy masters (select pieces and emulate them). Previous Next everything is connected to everything I had a lightbulb moment! One great thing about this class is you can do 1-on-1 consultations with Professor Sharon Lacey, who is a professional artist. I went into our call full of questions. cad (computer-aided design) While workshopping one of my self portraits, she suggested I add “construction lines,” which are  temporary lines that help anchor permanent lines. , I revisited the “Sighting Method,” a technique I learned in class where one repeatedly   Every feature affects every other feature. This process felt oddly familiar, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. All of a sudden, it all connected: this was exactly like CAD.  There’s literally a type of line in CAD softwares called “construction line” that functions exactly the same as the one I learned with Professor Lacey, and I voiced to her that connection.  I’ve been teaching myself Fusion360 for the past year, and have found it challenging to create some intricate shapes, but it all became easier because of this drawing class.  Every skill was transferable. In addition to applying   in CAD, I also learned to use  .  Changing the view settings in Fusion360 allows me to see how shadows fall to best capture what I’m trying to depict. I came out of the class excited to 3D design objects that were previously too intimidating for me to take on. massage therapy Similarly, I was also reminded of my mother’s work as a massage therapist. I told Professor Lacey about a time where I felt extremely sore in my shoulder from weight lifting and asked my mother for help. She began with massaging my leg, which I was really confused by. My legs didn’t hurt at all. My mom proceeded to explain that there are nerve “lines” that run through your entire body, and they’re all connected. To get to massaging even remotely near my shoulder, she had to tend to the lines that connected to it first. The bend of your leg changes the flux of arm muscle. This fascinated me, because I always thought of components of the body as very separate entities; one can move each limb independently. However, applied to drawing, I can look at how the adjustment of one limb affects the rest of the body, even in the subtlest of ways.  the butterfly effect I had to mention this.  The Butterfly Effect 
Chaos Theory, ⁠ 02 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">one of my favorite theories EVER</a>, partly because of its engineering applications but mostly because itʻs just so beautiful. i love viewing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">Lorenz Attractor,</a> which is basically a set of chaotic solutions (solutions that are super sensitive to what the initial conditions of a problem are) to the Lorenz system (a model of atmospheric convection). and the attractor, when graphed, happens to look somewhat like a butterfly, which I think is a cute coincidence of naming. conclusion I learned a lot of things from this class, both technical and non-technical. Finally, I feel comfortable with at least attempting to draw things. Now, I find myself sketching in the margins of museum maps, my school notes, napkins, anything I can get my hands on. The class was formative to this comfort, but I’ve also come to learn the accessibility of drawing. Anyone can draw, so long as you put pencil to paper and practice. And, of course, I’ve learned that nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, is left unconnected in this world. Source:  The Tate Gallery, 1992-3 #21M.601 Drawing for Designers #Art

Five years ago I wore a barong and sablay. In my high school graduation rites, there was a defined moment when we graduated. It was when the principal confirmed the graduates, through the authority vested in them from the Department of Education. At the end of my gap year between high school and college, I wrote a blog post quoting the chorus of  At Least It Was Here But I love you more than words can say 
I can’t count the reasons I should stay 
One by one they all just fade away 
But I love you more than words can say I wrote it because I didn’t feel “sad enough” about leaving the Philippines. I had friends I loved, and places I’d miss, but my friends had moved on and the places had changed. When I searched for reasons to stay, all I found was emptiness. A yearning for somewhere to call home, a place that’d last, not like the city I’d move out of, or all too short summer camps. On my first post on the blogs,  Colorful I had my first day of classes in MIT. There’s this saying I’m attached to: when you graduate from MIT, you die in real life. Implicit is the Institute being a life in  . You are born, or reborn, when you enter MIT. You die when you leave, only to be born, or reborn, wherever you end up next. In literary practice, bookends are matching scenes at the beginning and end of the story, to illustrate change or lack thereof. When things happen in my life I force them into stories, and when a story is about to end I think of its beginning. If time will push me  into cycles I had my last day of classes in MIT. Last weekend, I went to a retreat with some friends, and I didn’t realize we were in North Conway, New Hampshire, until someone suggested a visit to Diana’s Baths. The chorus of  Something Better And all my life 
I’ve seen these skies 
It’s paradise, paradise 
And every time 
I leave this place 
I’m terrified, terrified My life in MIT is paradise, in both the I Have Truly Found Paradise sense, and the I Hate This Fucking Place sense, because you cannot have one without the other. When I leave MIT it will be the end of one life. I’m terrified, but what choice do I have? There is no one moment when I “graduate”. The turning of the Brass Rat, the president’s charge for the graduates, the receipt of the diploma—these are pomp. The last day of class, the last dinner with friends, the day everyone moves out—these are circumstance. Today I will wear a cap and gown.

 event of this scale, featuring an art gallery and fashion show and bringing multiple groups together to celebrate arts at MIT. Put together over the course of the year by a team of  members and affiliates, the Gala featured 34 looks from 20 designers and showcased Issue 11’s ten spreads. The spreads, which you can check out  here mit gala at start of event MIT Gala was conceived from a simple desire to commemorate the magazine’s release with an event much bigger than a casual handout. Beyond spreading awareness about  , it was a definite success, given that it sold out, cohesively combined talent from a range of student groups, and inspired interest in arts at MIT. Running any sort of large event at MIT is hard. Besides the actual event planning, there’s a lot of hoops you have to jump through, such as security, room reservations, and safety plans. Even with years of detailed instructions on how to set up events, some organizations I’ve been a part of have struggled a  . That’s why I’m impressed how the MIT Gala board was able to make everything run smoothly in their first iteration of the event. It took a lot of coordination from the board, which consisted of 12 students from all classes. MIT Gala had a several thousand dollar budget, quite a bit of which went to the printing of the magazines. This was incredible because they’re really expensive, but could be handed out for free at the event. I think it’s great that the Gala enabled more students to have access to the magazines—in my experience, many more people were talking about the issue this semester than in the past. For a first-time event, it’s crucial that there’s a significant amount of pubbing done weeks in advance. Unsurprisingly, the designers killed it. I’ll let the content speak for itself. https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/348858473_6277977335600934_6467364592316268255_n.mp4 block printed tickets At the beginning of the event, attendees had the chance to explore the art gallery, which featured independent works from students and projects from classes. It had a wide range of mediums and was an amazing opportunity to showcase student work. The highlight of the event for me, though, was the fashion show, which featured models wearing works designed by MIT students and Boston creators. It was a whole affair—it took a ton of work from models, designers, stylists, and runway directors to be a success. I signed up to model since I’ve had great experiences modeling for   in the past. I thought it would be pretty casual, so I was taken aback to find out how well-coordinated as it was. It started with the models gathering in the Burton Conner dance studio to practice their walks and poses for the runway. As someone not engaged whatsoever with the fashion world, I didn’t realize how much work goes into walking, so I was a bit out of my element; even though I’m a dancer, I felt like my body was not cooperating. I knew it would take quite a bit of refinement to get to a place I was comfortable with, and adding 5-inch heels to the equation could only make the task more perilous. We headed to the Porter Room to practice walking on the runway, where a designer with runway experience was there to critique us. A track was playing to help guide the 8-counts we’d be walking and posing on, and the designer told us where to look, how to pause for the camera, and everything else, down to the last detail. After several run-throughs, I felt like I wouldn’t embarrass myself, and left to start getting ready. Thanks to a team of lovely stylists who graciously volunteered to help with the event, the models’ hair and makeup were done in accordance with their stylists’ vision. My designer wanted a natural/basic look for me, so I thought I’d be able to do my own makeup, but my stylist did a way better job than I ever could. Figures. I’m really grateful the process was organized from start to finish. The runway director and designers made sure there was no confusion on my part, and the only concern I had became the outfit I’d be wearing. It was a pretty huge concern, in fact. I had limited communication with my designer, the founder of Boston Fashion Week, so I didn’t know how I’d be styled. I knew I was wearing the  Science Surface collection a mid to low serve ig Previous Next Walking was a crazy experience. My friends did their utmost to catcall me so I’d lose character, but I didn’t break character, trip in my heels, or otherwise humiliate myself. Even though the ordeal only lasted a few minutes, the lighting and music made it feel legit; the runway was lined with red LEDs, courtesy of  E33 Productions MIT Laptop Ensemble Even though the show took a lot of hours out of my day, I was grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a dope experience. I loved spending time with the models and designers, and it was great to hear my friends cheering me on in the audience. Also, when I wasn’t modeling, I took advantage of the catering and photo booth, so I’d say it was a 10/10 event. MIT Gala was a huge success. It’s amazing that the event could take talent from so many different groups to showcase how vibrant the arts community is at MIT. Arts isn’t at the forefront of many students’ minds, so it’s incredible that MIT Gala could centralize various facets of art on campus and create a space that fosters connections between creative students. Not only was the event helpful for introducing people to  , but for encouraging people to explore different avenues of engaging in art on campus. While the future of this event is uncertain, I have no doubt that it will evolve to be even more wonderful. I’m excited to see how it grows and can’t wait to see what   does next! this amazing post

I was probably one of the youngest people ever to read the blogs. I have no idea how I stumbled across them as an elementary schooler with very limited unsupervised screen time, but I did, and I fell totally in love. The blogs were one of the first pieces of writing I ever binged, after Harry Potter but before any other book series, fanfiction, and the newspaper. Sam and Mitra and Mollie, the earliest bloggers,  MIT to me. They were weird and cool and smart and funny. They weren’t just everything I wanted to be, but everything I wished I could find around me as I struggled to make friends through elementary and into middle and high school. When I got into MIT, visited for CPW, and finally comMITted, the biggest reason behind my decision to come here was  the people Today, it is five years and one month after I comMITted; four years and eleven months after I applied to be a blogger. I have been blogging for ten semesters; five years; about seventy-five blogs. Although I can still bring it up in my mind, the MIT that the blogs showed me when I was still young has been almost entirely replaced by the MIT that I’ve seen myself with my own two eyes. Of course, the MIT I know after five years of living here is  on every level than the one I knew only through others’ words. This MIT is larger, better, more complex, worse, more joyful, harder. But at its core, I do think that it is the same. MIT has been a place where I felt more like I belonged than I ever did before. MIT has been a place where I cried because I felt so alone. MIT has been a place where I accomplished things I never believed I could. MIT has been a place where I fell down and did not know how I could possibly get back up again — and where someone reached out a helping hand and pulled me up. All of these experiences are the kind that shape a person, and shape the relationships between people. I loved the school I went to from grades 7 through 12; I spent six years there and when I left I was a fundamentally different person than I was when I arrived. I believed then, and still believe now, that that school made the person I am today. I don’t think this is true of MIT: I am not a fundamentally different person than I was when I arrived. But I’ve changed dramatically. I arrived at MIT with the raw materials I needed to be an adult — maturity, compassion, curiosity and a desire to grow — but no idea what to do with them. MIT took me in, ragged at the edges, with sharp spots and pieces that didn’t quite fit together, and helped me shape myself into something I could be proud of. I’m not all the way there yet (who is?) and I don’t know exactly what my next steps will look like, but I’ve come a long way and I know that I know how to keep moving forward. All through this process I’ve been blogging, writing about the mundane, the little joys, the big questions, the uncertainties, the accomplishments. Sometimes late at night when I don’t want to go to bed and I’m feeling a little bit of bittersweet nostalgia, I get caught up clicking through my own old blog posts. Their emotions feel so familiar, but the time they write about feels so long ago. My own blogs are, to me, primarily a benchmark of how I’ve changed and how I’ve stayed the same. When I fell in love with the blogs, I didn’t have the maturity to see these changes in others; the MIT I first loved was static, one solid shape rather than a detailed picture. There’s nothing wrong with that — you have to see the shape of a picture first before you can begin to fill it in. If you are new to these pages or to MIT, I hope for you, sometime in these past years, I’ve drawn some of the shape. But if you’re a regular, then I wonder if I might have managed to fill in a few of the details. I hope so. After five years of blogging, I’ve changed in all the ways people usually do. I’m more tired, more jaded, more experienced. I have a better sense of what I want out of life, but still feel that I don’t know what I want out of life. I’ve made friends and lost them. I’ve struggled through tragedies and kept going. The change I’m proudest of is that I’m more confident in myself and who I am. I came to MIT a quirky nerd who was unafraid to speak up, who liked leading groups and loved learning new things, who wanted to work hard and do well. I am leaving as someone who is all these things, and proud of it; someone who doesn’t feel that I have to hide who I am to make friends and feel welcomed. The blogs were one of the first places I ever saw people like me being so openly proud of who they were. I hope that some of my own journey to reach that place has come through on here. I hope that if you’re a young person reading these words, you can believe, as I did, that this is a place — and there are many such places — where this can happen to you too. Now the magic of MIT has done everything it can for me: the real world calls. Five years ago, MIT was scary, big, exciting, unknown, full of possibilities. Today, my new job and my new city feel the same way. They will shape me, just as MIT has, in ways I do not yet know. This is an adventure beyond what the blogs can show me and what I can show on the blogs. But I have the friends I’ve made, who can guide me, learn alongside me, and help me when I struggle. I have the lessons I’ve learned about living, which I’ll surely build upon but which make a strong foundation for that building. And I have confidence that I’ll figure it all out somehow. Thank you for reading, today and at any and every time in the past five years. Thank you for making this space where I could learn first from others and then from myself. Thank you for being there through the best and worst of times. This place has changed my life. I hope I have repaid the gift by changing, in however small of a way, yours. 💜

Is it selfish that I’m happy as we pass the setting sun? from  goodbye : So long, goodbye Hey, here’s a fun idea How ’bout I sit on the couch and I watch you next time? I wanna hear you tell a joke when no one’s laughing in the background So this is how it ends I promise to never go outside again from  waves : I watched my wild youth Disappear in front of my eyes Moments of magic and wonder It seems so hard to find Is it ever coming back again? Is it ever coming back again? Take me back to the feeling when Everything was left to find from  why am i the one : Or go on, go on, go on If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come Why am I the one always packing up my stuff? For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I’m right where I belong Why am I the one always packing all my stuff? from  going home with miles and alaska : I wanted to go home, by which I mean the fall of 1993 – smoking cigarettes under this bridge with people I loved who loved me. I’d never loved peers like that before: ferociously, without any self-consciousness or fear. That couldn’t have lasted, of course, and it didn’t. As the graffitied Walt Whitman quote puts it so succinctly, “These are the days that must happen to you.” And after, you can go back to the smoking hole and its beautiful graffiti, but you can’t be home again. from  homestuck : TT: Please do not do this, Dirk. TT: Why not?? TT: Because. TT: I do not want to die. TT: I understand you are disgusted with me. TT: As an unpalatable expression of yourself. TT: I would feel the same way if I was in your situation. TT: Which I am. TT: As such, I know that you know this is wrong. TT: … TT: Dirk. TT: Don’t kill me. TT: Please. TT: I am scared. TT: You are? TT: Yes. TT: I am scared to not exist. TT: Aren’t you? from  bojack horseman : D: I think there are people that help you become the person you end up being, and you can be grateful for them, even if they were never meant to be in your life forever. I’m glad I knew you too. B: Knew, huh? D: Mhm. B: Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if this night was the last time we ever talked to each other? cj – something better, goodbye, why am i the one, homestuck vincent – violet evergarden, everything goes on, waves, going home with miles and alaska, bojack horseman

For my (maybe?) last blog post, I felt that it was only fitting to write some notes for the people that have made my MIT experience, especially this last semester, memorable and good. Here are just a few of them. To my dearest, sweetest Emma. I feel like this will be a reiteration of my Peace Corps rec letter for you, but let this be a public display of my affections. I am incredibly grateful that I happened to stumble into Maseeh Waffle Night all those years ago in April 2019 during CPW. And that I made the decision to walk up to Bryan despite not having seen him since the fifth grade. And that you took the initiative in the conversation and turned to me and asked “hey are you filipino?” and that interaction alone solidified us as friends for life. I’ve truly never met anyone like you. It’s something that you can only understand once you’re actually in your presence, words unfortunately can’t do it justice. But being around you really does feel as though I’ve been transported in some manic pixie dream girl world, where the rules and laws of the world are beneath us and we are, in fact, the drivers of the plots of our own novels. Call it lucky girl syndrome, call it optimism, call it what you want; there is just something so magical and whimsical about being with you. I entered MIT really afraid of what people were going to think of me. I was scared and self-conscious and worried about literally every little thing I did or said. I wanted so desperately to be liked. But by seeing the way you existed — the way you’d burst into song in public, or break out dancing in the middle of the field, or laugh so, so loudly in the middle of lecture — without a care in the world, with no fear of repercussion or consequence, taught me that I could do the same. Yes, I’ll still panic when you knock something over and instinctively yell “ !” at you, or side-eye you when you play a video in a library without any headphones in, but I think I just will never be able to fully let go of my inhibitions in the way that you do. I think at some point in our friendship, I used to envy you. The way in which you could parade around campus, waving and smiling at everyone. Seeing the way in which you not only thrived on campus, but thrived   you went, how you could so easily build connections with anyone and everyone. But as I grew, that envy morphed into respect. A profound, deep respect for you and everything that you are. I will never have the confidence to just walk up to someone and befriend them in the way that you do, but that’s okay. That’s why we work, such polar opposites of people that somehow found their way to each other. Thank you for being my friend all these years. For telling me when I fuck up and teaching me how to grow from my mistakes. For pushing me out of my comfort zone. For teaching me to relax more once in a while, to trust in the world and the luckiness that pervades our space instead of trying to micromanage everything. For giving me the YA book life I’ve always dreamed of having. There’s nothing else I can really say here aside from what I wrote in your letter. I have always known Emma would be the person in our friend group to do fantastic things beyond even my understanding. Her aspirations are lofty and high. Someone who may not know Emma may look at her bucket list and scoff, thinking that it would be impossible to achieve such a range of activities even in the long life-span we as humans have. However, anyone who knows her would look at the list and wouldn’t bat an eye. Their kneejerk reaction would be “Of course” because Emma is a doer. She is known to do what she puts her mind to. That’s why I didn’t even react when she told me she would be applying to the Peace Corps. Instead, I had the same simple thought in my head: Of course. This makes perfect sense for Emma because not only is she a doer, she is a doer of *good*. And perhaps that is the most important kind of doer. Emma has always ensured that she uses her talents and intelligence for something that betters the world, that moves it forward. And I firmly believe that she will continue to better the world around her, just through her presence and existence alone….She has an incredible work ethic, having taken so many classes at MIT while balancing it alongside her various extracurriculars like Rocket Team and varsity volleyball. But most importantly of all, she is kind. She is always the first to cheer after a friend’s presentation. The first to call during summer break. The first to go in for a hug after a long period of not seeing someone. I could not recommend anyone more to this program than Emma. Emma, my favorite agile and power 5’3″, how lucky I am to know you. To my dearest Eva, I’m…so fucking sad to know that we met so late into our MIT career. I have never met anyone so acutely aware of their presence and impact on others, someone who is so in tune with not only their emotions but others’ as well. It’s something about you that I find incredibly admirable and something I’ve learned from you a lot. I want to thank you for being the epitome of what a good friend is. I feel like you’re always the first to check in, the first to comfort, the first one to run over when something gets fucked. You’re the kind of person where I know I can tell you anything and I won’t receive any harsh judgments upon the first pass, and it’s something that I’ve really relied on and especially appreciated these past couple of months. I also love the way you try and delve into people’s interests. The amount of times I’ve mansplained something stupid and niche to you like Twitch vocabulary or the Omegaverse or some other fucked terminally online thing, you actually make effort to understand it and get excited about it. I think this letter is easier to write and feels less sappy because I have such a strong confidence in the fact that this isn’t goodbye, but a see you really soon, because you’re one of the most communicative and reliable people I know. I can say with certainty that we’re going to text. That I’m going to see you in July in SF. That we’re going to lose our fucking minds in the farthest back row of the Taylor Swift concert in August. That I’m going to come back and visit Boston and crash in whatever apartment or complex you’ve found. I just know it so strongly because that’s just the kind of friend and person you are. But regardless, I’m going to miss our loud, inappropriate conversations in Baker dining or Hayden, spilling all our tea and stories in front of … literally everyone sitting around us. Our spicy Bridgerton nights where we’re just screaming at a TV for 4 hours over people making intense eye contact. Sitting in your room sipping on wine and talking. I’m going to miss you so…so..SO fucking much, but I will literally see you so soon and I’m going to bother the shit out of you and sit in your apartment and you will not be able to get rid of me, Eva, I promise it. I love you so much. Not a goodbye, but see you soon. Dearest Kylee, I’ve been meaning to write a message like this to you for fucking forever but every time I try to start I kind of tear up and get stressed because I really can’t imagine a world where we don’t go to the same school together. You were the first person I ever met in person at MIT! I still remember walking with you around Random Hall and then to Flour to get my first meal ever as a real MIT student with another MIT student. For a good, long portion of my life, I really didn’t believe that people were inherently  . Or that a truly   person existed. I think I was just 13 and really edgy, but, genuinely, knowing you has really showed me that there really are truly, wholeheartedly good people out there. I always jokingly refer to you as my moral compass whenever I talk about you to other people, but the statement still stands. You’ve been there through every single major moral crisis I’ve had at MIT and I will go to you every single time because I know I can always, always trust your judgment on something 100%. You have such a way with words in a way that I never will and you always manage to express things so succinctly and accurately. I also appreciate how you will always remind me to consider the other person, to not just remind me to be empathetic, but really show me how to put empathy into practice. I will always love your stupid deez nuts jokes, the way you always manage to bring up Georgia or the South into every conversation we have, the “hey that’s what they used to call me in high school” bit that we play into way too much. Thank you for being my Jeopardy buddy, my fellow Santouka stan, my favorite enabler of “hey….can I take a quick look at that?” Just know that you can’t get rid of me that easily and that I   be bothering you in Ohio every chance that I get. I love, love, love you to the moon and back. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for teaching me to be a kinder, more considerate person. Thank you for being my shoulder to cry on for all these years. To my dearest deephers, Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the love and kindness you’ve shown me throughout these two years. The day I moved into the house I cried because I was afraid I wasn’t going to have any friends or feel like the hussy mansion would ever be my home. But oh how I was so fucking wrong. Some of my favorite nights from these past two years have been our rotting sessions, sitting on that (what I’ve only realized now is) gray couch, talking shit, eating Vivi’s chicken and boba, and procrastinating on work. I’ve loved being your resident frat brother this semester. Thank you for giving me such joy in one of my hardest semesters. Thank you for listening to my rants and complaints and indulging in my wild, crazy stories about hookups and mistakes and messiness. To the seniors that already have left us and taught me how to make dphie a home: I love you. I miss you all so much. I will come visit you all. To the juniors and sophomores I’m leaving: I’m gonna come back and visit. I kinda have to, since all my stuff is in the house, but also I’m coming back because I love and care about you all so deeply. MIT is really fucking hard, and so please remember to care for each other and lean into each other when you need it. And now some quick notes: arianna – I love you so much, you don’t even know. You are one of the kindest, most compassionate people I’ve ever met. I’m going to miss your silly screaming, your fidgeting, your obsession with Zelda, and your silly meche activities. The world has thrown so much shit at you that you do not deserve and yet you remain so resilient and kind to everyone you meet. I adore you endlessly, even though you lied to me in poker and made me cry when I was drunk. siyoung – I am so sad we became friends so late, but also I don’t think we could’ve been friends earlier because we hadn’t yet gone on our ~character development~ growth arcs yet. I think you really strive to understand people and to hear them out and the advice and perspective you give always is so precise and helpful. I admire the way in which you push others to grow and reevaluate themselves. But not only that, I think you’re a kind, caring person as well, in the way that you constantly check in on people and ask how they’re doing and really do take the time to  . It’s something so rare and hard to come by these days, and you are so special for that. mulan – You are such a talented, smart, and driven person. I’ve already said all these things in your senior shoutout, but I admire the way in which you hold yourself so, so much. You speak with such poise and grace, and simultaneously know how to stand up for yourself and stand your ground. I love how silly and goofy you are and I love your frat bro accent you develop when hanging out with frat men for too long. I love you to bits and can’t wait to see what you do in the future, mi amor. sirena – Sirena!!! I don’t even know where to begin. I’m so happy we got closer this semester. I feel like even though we’re not very similar people, we get along very well and mesh together so well. Thank you for watching AOT with me and explaining all the little things that I don’t understand. Thank you for the deep philosophical questions and making me just think more about myself and the world in general. And ultimately thank you for being such a calm presence in the house that offers up so much wisdom and perspective to all of us. I can’t wait to hang out (and live..?) with you in New York. Have the most fantastic time in Japan and I’ll see you in June/July! jess – I am so happy we got to talk more this semester. Thank you for listening to me rant and vent and giving me so much advice. I’m so happy to have spent so much time with you just shit talking and also talking about our crippling ADHD. I cannot wait to hang out with you in New York <3 I feel kind of silly for writing this one, especially putting you in my last ever blogpost, but also, I think life is too short to not to say what’s on your mind and thank the people in your life. I think you’ve changed the trajectory of this semester so much for me, even in the short period I knew you. And though time wasn’t on our side and I don’t even know the likelihood of us ever interacting ever again, I can say with full confidence that I am very grateful that I decided to go over that night. And all the days and nights after. Despite being a blogger whose whole job is to write their feelings and thoughts down, I told you I’m not really good at words, and that I struggle to give out compliments and kindness because that’s just not how I was raised. So I figured I owed you this too, since I’ve never really told you all the things I think about you. I think you’re an incredibly sweet person with a good heart. Thank you for giving me so many fun memories this semester and making me laugh and ultimately just giving me someone to look forward to seeing after class. There’s a lot more I could say, and maybe I’ll just send this to you personally, but just know that You once called me out, saying that I like to act tough but inside I’m really just a big softie and if this blogpost is anything to go by, you’d be exactly correct. I really loved having you in my life and having our paths cross over, even for just a brief bit of time. I like to think that if we had met earlier, things would’ve ended differently. But that’s just not how things go, and even though it ended somewhat abruptly, I’m really happy with how this semester went and having had the chance of meeting and getting to know you. Megan, I love you so so much. I love running into you randomly and then just talking for hours about anything and everything. Conversations with you always make me think   fucking hard about life and the world. I am so impressed by how much you do on campus and honestly just by how much you care. You are an absolute superhero. I also want to take this time to remind you to take care of yourself, make sure you don’t burn out, and also say that it’s okay to take breaks once in a while. Come visit me in New York, bae, and I hope you have a fun time in India. I don’t even know where to begin! I feel incredibly emotional to be saying goodbye to the first ever real home I felt at MIT. In my freshman year, I became a blogger. And I got to meet so many people through the blogs and it was the first community I ever interacted with. Even though our beginning meetings were a little stiff and awkward, once the pandemic hit and we did our silly little zoom calls, blogger meetings became such a huge part of my life and my MIT experience. Every week, I would look forward to our calls and stay for hours just shooting the shit and chatting with everyone. I want to just especially thank the AOs and the blogger community for putting up with my crazy antics, my endless blogs in which I overshare, my horrible ideas, my drama, and everything else. Every time I’ve had a question about MIT or life or needed advice on something, the blogger slack is one of the first places I think of because you all have so much knowledge and wisdom. I feel like I’ve learned so much from all of the admissions officers and bloggers on here but in particular: alan – I literally just admire you so fucking much. I don’t know how you do all the things that you do, but you do them and you do them  While simultaneously being a kind and great person to be around. I know this semester has been especially stressful for you, and I just wanted to say that I’m proud of you for all that you’ve done and you have so many people rooting for you! mel – My blogger child, my MIT pen pal, my crocheting king. I’ve loved all of our conversations and I always love being around you and spending time with you. I literally adore you to bits and I promise to visit you lots and please hang out with me!!!! I am always wishing you well and I hope the world sends you good things. ella – Ella ella!!! I am so so happy you became a blogger. I literally love sitting next to you in blogger meetings making side comments and talking shit with you. You are endlessly funny and intelligent. Your writing is incredible and constantly inspires me. kellen – Even though you’re not an admissions officer here anymore, I feel like I’ve just learned so much from you. I am so grateful for all the trust you put in me, especially with the MIT Admissions account and letting me run wild with my stupid ideas. You’re honestly such a positive presence and mentor for so many people and I love and appreciate how you’ll always encourage students in their silly projects and endeavors. Thank you for believing in me and supporting me. jeremy – Jeremy!!!! I don’t even know where to begin :( Thank you so much for always listening to my drama and my tea and giving me advice and also for always making me laugh in and out of blogger meetings. Thank you for always looking out for me as well and giving me advice whenever I ask for it. You honestly make the admissions and the blogging-sphere feel like such a safe and comfortable environment and have helped mold it so much into the community it is today. petey – I don’t even know where to start! I will also probably write and email you a longer version of this so take an abridged version: Thank you for being such a supportive and kind mentor to me throughout these four years at MIT. I remember feeling very lost and uncertain during summer 2020 and the weekly MIT coaching whatever support calls we had were something that really grounded me and helped me figure out my place at MIT. I was so stressed about my major and my path and what the world had in store for me, but through these talks I was able to figure it out (ish, or I guess, worry about them a little less). I am so very thankful for everything you’ve given me and taught me over the years, constantly providing me and pointing me towards resources. I especially am grateful for the advice you gave me last summer when I was having difficulty with my workplace — I was very scared and didn’t know how to handle the situation, I felt as though I had really found myself in deep, deep shit and didn’t know how to climb out, but the advice and words you gave me were extremely meaningful. Every single time I faced some major hardship or roadblock at MIT, I could turn to you and the other admissions officers to support me and advise me through it and for that I am so endlessly grateful. Thank you for always looking out for me. And perhaps on a cliché, thank you to every single one of you who has read my blogs and the blogs in general. I’ve kept every single email that readers have sent me and I’m just so grateful and honored to be able to have a platform and audience in the first place. This job is so fucking cool, like  fucking cool and I’ve gotten so many amazing opportunities through it. I am always so touched whenever someone tells me they’ve read one of my blogs, or sent it to a friend, or even tell me in person that they read them consistently. I always forget that I’m not yelling into a void. This job has been hard — it’s been weird being perceived by so many people. But I wouldn’t change a thing. I love being a blogger, I love being able to write for the blogs, and I love reading all of your comments and emails. Thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me such a cool weird funky little job. You can follow what I’m up to on my socials |  x x I will also be trying to slowly migrate all my blogposts to  Substack

After four years here at MIT, I am finally graduating. I have a lot of mixed feelings on graduating. On one hand, I’m nervous. I’m terrified to leave MIT. How do you make new friends as a new grad? What if I have no friends? What if I hate my job? What if my roommates don’t like me? How are you gonna tell me I’m just going to need to be an adult for the rest of my life now? But on the other hand, I know that this chapter of my life is done and that in order to grow we need to put ourselves in uncomfortable positions and this is a necessary step towards growth. Regardless of that, though, the irrational part of my brain has just been set to panic. I’m afraid to graduate. I don’t know what this summer looks like. And I’ve been trying to convince myself that that’s okay, because it is okay, and things will be okay, but it’s hard to know things will be okay when I’m not…  the okay. But then I think back to where I was four years ago and how   I’ve come. I couldn’t have anticipated any of this — any of the things I’ve accomplished or seen or done. And so I’m trying really, really,   fucking hard to embrace the unknown, to open my arms out to it and welcome what the universe has in store for me. This Saturday, I officially move to New York City. I have no plans, no itinerary, no agenda (well, until August, at least) and for the first time in my life and I will be simply doing whatever the world pushes me to do. Despite the fear and the nervousness, I do have a lot of hopes for this summer. I’m excited to explore New York. I want to eat good food and explore the clubs and bars. I want to continue crocheting (did I mention I picked up crocheting?) and learn how to embroider. I want to cook and bake a lot more. I want to read more books and write a lot more and and and I just have a lot of things I want to do, which reminds me of my   back from July of 2019. In this application, I wrote a sample blogpost in response to the prompt ‘What is your current obsession?” Here’s that blogpost: in the beginning of the summer, i made this long list of things i was gonna do to improve myself and “glo up” but unfortunately, my arch nemesis who i thought i had defeated in may began to manifest itself into ways never known before. high school had returned to haunt me and had conditioned me to believe that if i’m not going to be the best, then what’s the point in doing it? and in this singular thanos snap, my motivation was gone in the wind. so instead of doing all the things listed above, i decided to procrastinate by turning to my holy grail: the sims 4. the only people who play the sims 4 as much as i do are the ones who spoiler alert: im the latter,,,thats me, folks! thats how cami tdoog came to life – the sim version of me that is not only an accomplished surgeon, but also good at all of these things too: she’s basically the ideal version of me, a version of myself that’s smart, athletic, and a cooking kween. (she also brings home BIG bucks for the kids so they should be grateful,) originally, i went to the sims to escape responsibility and wallow in self pity as i watch her cook eggs benedict while i struggled to even fry an egg. but, funnily enough, watching my sim grow in her skills actually..motivated me to start doing the things i said i’d do. for the past week or so, i’ve been watching my sim grow her talents. from starting house fires with her horrendous cooking to making dinner every night for our family with finesse, the sims helped me come to the somewhat painfully obvious conclusion that ~with practice comes perfect~. to be honest, it was inspiring to see cami tdoog grow into the accomplished woman she is today. with a few clicks of my mouse, i put her to work. gym, cooking, handywork. and yeah, she definitely struggled. after about an hour at the gym she was ready to pass out, but now, she’s a gym rat. i realized that i could be cami tdoog if i really tried. i didn’t have to keep longingly looking at a screen and envy a freakin’  sim so i got my sh*t together. i whipped out my unused bullet journal and  started making plans. in the back of my head, there still was a bit of fear lingering. what if what i do ends up being bad? but then i remembered cami tdoog. and she had the firefighters over at our house  three this month, i’ve been doing everything i wanted to do. i painted my first painting in the past three years. i started learning how to cook and bake [cause i signed up for only cook for yourself dorms HAHAHahAh catch me starvin!!] i started singing again and revived my dead youtube channel to document my progress because i am a  sucker  i’m boxing? and dancing? and doing all the things i never had time for before and it is so,  so feel so cami tdoog, this is my love letter to you. thank you for inspiring me to stop watching and start doing. i may not become a world famous surgeon like you, but at least i can cook a fried egg without burning my own home down. I have gotten better at cooking. And guitar and piano and singing. And I actually do consistently go to the gym now. So I really feel like I’ve come far. Seeing this blogpost…the excitement that I have when it comes to new hobbies and wondering what my future has in store for me, I feel that all coming back now that I’m moving to a new place. So yes, the future is. Incredibly incredibly scary. I am terrified. But also, looking back on eager dumb prefrosh Cami reminds me that there’s so much I have yet to learn and discover about myself. So here is to graduation! And to my summer in New York!

i’ve ⁠ 01 cj: speaking is lumia n. '24 time passes. frosh fall was when i really got to know
 
cj. ⁠ 02 cj: the amount of times i am mentioned in this post is kinda uncomfortable lol time passes. i finally met cj in person in frosh spring, when mit let people live on campus again. this was back in covid times, when we had these things called “pods”. i was in the same pod as alex and a couple others from a sizable friend group, and we played a lot of board (and video) games together. cj wasn’t in our pod, but since i lived on floorpi anyways, i interacted with cj’s pod a lot, with my interactions including playing  stone age 
pod’s lounge ⁠ 03 all the pods had rooms as lounges. his pod's was H306 and mine was H314 time passes. yannick, who was in cj’s pod, had the goal of playing all the board games on floorpi before he graduated. i don’t remember whether he actually completed this, but from what i remember from looking at data, he at least got pretty close. one board game that he hadn’t played yet was spirit island. apparently cj liked it a lot, because the day after, he dm’d me this message: of course, i said yes, though i’d also never played before. (this was after we got vaccinated so we could actually play together) i did remember looking at all the games on that shelf earlier, when i wanted to play a shorter game with my pod, and we passed up spirit island because the box said 90-120 minutes. cj told me that it was closer to 30 minutes times the number of players, and as i’m writing about it 2 years later, i agree with this. Previous Next he then asked me to choose one of the four low complexity spirits, just
 
based on vibes. ⁠ 04 cj: this is the correct way to play your first spirit island game cj explained the rules to me very well, despite having played the game only once before. he explained roughly how the invaders worked, what blight and dahan and fear did, and how we fight against them. like always, there were a couple of outstanding questions, but those were niche enough that they were better answered as they come up during the game. i don’t remember which spirit cj played, i think it was river. since neither of us knew anything about strategy, winning was nontrivial, though not difficult either. now, there were at least 4 things that made me want to play more: 
plastic = bad and wood = good ⁠ 05 cj: not very subtle, this game 
which i didn’t particularly like, ⁠ 06 cj: i think hanabi is a bad game, fight me we ended up playing a lot more in the rest of the semester. i would play a game with a podmate right afterwards, and then we spread it around the rest of our pod. the next couple of games, i would play through the 3 other low complexity spirits with cj, in sandbox-ish games against the max level adversaries (where we control all the random cards), just to see what the adversaries would be like. i don’t quite remember anything else about those games, except that one of them had both of us trying to play 2 low complexity spirits at once, which was definitely too overwhelming for the amount of experience either of us had. i think i played lightning and river for that game, and i didn’t yet understand how their synergy worked. Previous Next i and cj would both eventually play all 8 spirits in the base game at least once that semester. at this point, this was basically the only board game on floorpi that i would end up playing for the rest of the semester. by the end of the semester, we were playing against low-level adversaries and winning pretty consistently. eventually, i would find out that spirit island had expansions, and my hyperfixation got even stronger. we did buy the expansions with the prize money from the puzzlehunt, but it was very late in the semester so we wouldn’t be able to play it before the summer ended. time passes. as fall 2021 began, the first thing i did after returning to campus was looking for the expansions we bought. unfortunately, branch and claw failed to be delivered, so we only had jagged earth, but jagged earth was a lot of content anyways. we opted to not add all the expansion content yet, at least not combining the power card decks together, because we were still playing with a lot of newer players, and we would need to separate the decks if we wanted to do so. fortunately, some jagged earth spirits could be played without expansion content. so became my first game as starlight. then a second, then a third, then like 10 more. before long, starlight became my most played spirit. i of course also tried out the other spirits that didn’t need tokens several times, though we were also locked out of a lot of the spirits because we didn’t want to combine decks together. i played fractured, memory, and shroud several times, though i still enjoyed starlight a lot more. i think the reason i liked it was because it was the spirit that did the most of the two things i enjoyed the most: gaining power cards, and matching elements with each other. Previous Next time passes. at some point later in the semester, i became floorpi’s
 
gamecomm, ⁠ 07 manager of board games 08 cj: floorpi is run through comms, which are people responsible for something like buying games or maintaining the kitchen we finally decided to combine the decks together. with the extra power cards from both branch and claw and jagged earth, the minor and major power decks became huge and shuffling them became hard. we still had everything stored in plastic bags too, so setting up a game would take almost as long as a (2-player) game itself. therefore, cj decided to buy
 
an organizer. ⁠ 09 cj: this is from towerrex, i love all their organizers this is also around the time when cj made a spreadsheet to document all of floorpi’s games of spirit island. the first few games didn’t have a lot of details on them, but as time progressed, we started adding more and more calculations to the spreadsheet, like a sheet for spirit pairings, person-spirit pairings, and info sheets for the spirits and for the adversaries. i was able to find some extra details for our earlier games through pictures that cj posted on blog posts before. when the organizer finally arrived, setup time became short enough that we went from playing two games a week to almost one game a day. at some point,
 
cj said ⁠ 10 this is a riff on the quote “We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth,” which i thought was kinda silly this was definitely the most active semester. we would play several larger games, including one game where we needed to draw another island board because there were only 6 boards in the physical game, but we played the card that added a 7th. after that we would play the card that destroys a board, but we would do shenanigans that would leave one of its lands intact and other shenanigans that let the card destroy a land on a different board all the way across the island. in the end,
 
the island ended up looking like this: ⁠ 11 cj: to be clear, that is one isolated land, not adjacent to anything Previous Next time passes. in 2022, we started with playing about 4 games a week, though the amount we played slowly dwindled due to other commitments. i would still be updating the spreadsheet, adding other sheets for spirit-adversary pairings and other statistics. the spreadsheet would work slower over time, and we started talking about building a web app to do these calculations more quickly. we also kinda stopped playing with just each other in 2 player games. i think we just didn’t find it interesting enough anymore. instead, we tried controlling more than 1 spirit at a time. sometimes we would play 2 handed, but other times we would each control 1 spirit but have another spirit be jointly controlled, making the game 1.5-handed. another factor that may have contributed was that we completed every spirit-spirit pairing, so we didn’t have nearly as much to work towards anymore. even though we stopped playing with just each other nearly as much, we started becoming more involved with the greater spirit island playing community. i and alex would become active in the main spirit island discord server, discussing strategy and rules. on the server, alex would post pictures of the games that we played on floorpi and at et. we would also consume more
 
spirit island content ⁠ 12 cj: you know a game's serious when there's lots of content around it various youtubers podcast about spirit island by this point, spirit island has long been thoroughly entrenched into our lives. when we play other board games, we use spirit island terminology to talk about things. for example, cj apparently forgot how resources worked in 7 wonders, so i told him they work like elements. this would be much more visible in other cooperative games though. when we play aeon’s end, we would call our characters “spirits”, the monster we fight against an “adversary”, and our spells “slow powers”. i would even answer questions asked to general groups with spirit island references. the silliest one i remember is someone asking about how to choose a major, and i said something about taking the one that fits my elements. i would also change both my minecraft username and skin to starlight. i would then import my minecraft username into real life, and that’s why my name is now lumia. relatedly, i would experience gender euphoria by
 
hitting every elemental threshold with starlight, ⁠ 13 cj: a feat i have not done yet time passes. in the fall, two new expansions for spirit island was announced. the first one was horizons, which was a standalone game that was a slightly simplified version to cater to more people, but it had new spirits so we wanted it anyways. the second one was nature incarnate, and it was talked about a lot, because they were introducing a new mechanic and a lot of content. we were also pretty hyped for it and printed out some of the announced content so we could play it ourselves. i bought horizons on the day it came out, traveling south to a target past where the red line split. it took a decent amount of time, but i did get to see
 
cj’s reaction ⁠ 14 cj: it was a pretty strong reaction lol a couple days later, i would give alex the stuff we printed on floorpi, since we didn’t need it anymore. i forgot to tell him not to look at it until he got home, so he figured out pretty quickly that i have acquired horizons. in november 2022, nature incarnate would open its campaign on  backerkit 
under 15 minutes. ⁠ 15 cj: incredibly wild time passes. i and cj have started going to et more often. in spring of 2023, cj
 
pledged to et while i initiated ⁠ 16 pledging basically means becoming a member of the house, initiating basically means becoming a resident of the house floorpi was more convenient for all of us, but et’s copy had sleeves, which made a major difference, in that we could add more cards to et’s copy more easily because we could put the new nature incarnate cards we printed in front of other cards (that we could steal from horizons, because horizons’s cards were just a copy of the cards from the base game), and then we wouldn’t be able to tell apart the newly added cards from the cards we already have. anyways, our schedules didn’t line up well enough for us to play on floorpi often anymore, so a substantial proportion of our games this semester were at et, where we could play with the new cards. i would try to play spirits that liked major powers at et so i could see more of them. since cj is graduating and ec is getting cast down after this semester, i have been appreciating playing with him on floorpi more. he seems to be so naturally good at the game, and he’s pretty decisive about what he’s doing every turn, unlike me who often takes a while to make decisions about what cards to play. (though it definitely doesn’t help that starlight is one of the most complex spirits and massively widens the decision space) as we played our final game on floorpi before packing everything, we made sure to make it memorable, and end up sinking the entire island except for one land. i’ll miss cj so much after he graduates, hopefully he comes and visits us regularly. i think we’ve convinced him to come play some games with us after nature incarnate comes out. I MISS BESTIE ALREADY

Recently, one of my friends relayed that she grew up in an environment filled with vicious, competitive peers.  It’s a story I’ve heard from plenty of people.  . This dynamic might continue long after college admissions; after another friend received a prestigious graduate fellowship, he said he felt it, too. I’ve never really known how to deal with others’ envy, and it feels weird to even say that, to suggest that other people might be envious of me—it’s like I’m claiming there’s something about me or what I have that is so spectacular that others might want it, and isn’t that a boastful claim to make? And isn’t it presumptuous of me to assume someone else’s underlying emotions? So I’ll give an example where the other person openly admitted their envy of me, so I don’t have to speculate about their motivations. I switched to a math major (from a humanities major) in fall 2019; initially I struggled to adjust, but by late 2020, I had gained more confidence in the area. Some cool opportunities came my way: I was invited to speak at Math Prize for Girls, a competition for top female students in mathematics, which I’d attended in high school. I was accepted into well-regarded international programs. I was admitted into a research program that led me to co-write a graph theory paper with an established mathematician, which was then published in a combinatorics journal and got me an  Erdös number One of my close friends, a fellow math major and a guy, saw all this happening and asked, point-blank: “Do you think you’re getting all of this because you’re a girl?” That question went over about as well as you might expect. I was one of four women (out of sixty students) in my research program. If they were trying to show favoritism to girls, they were doing a terrible job at it. Later, he did confess that he’d asked that because he was jealous that I was succeeding, even though he didn’t think I was that good at math. We talked things through and moved on. This was a relatively mild situation—yes, this guy was upset and said something rude, but he wasn’t actively rooting for my downfall, and he never would’ve done anything malicious to hurt my prospects. But in another universe, maybe he would’ve emailed those programs saying I was bad at math so they should kick me out, although I’m not sure how effective that approach would’ve been. Maybe he would’ve purposefully given me the wrong answers when I asked him for help. Maybe this resentment would’ve manifested in ways that are completely unrelated to math. In retrospect, I’m not entirely sure how I should’ve defused the situation or avoided it in the first place. Yes, there’s an argument that I didn’t do anything wrong so there was nothing I should’ve done differently—that’s true, but it isn’t about whether or not I’m morally right. It’s about self-preservation, and things could’ve gotten much worse if this guy had been more malicious. Perhaps I shouldn’t have texted him about all the good things happening—maybe that had felt like bragging. Or I asked him for too much homework help, so his impression of my math ability was worse than the truth? Once I’d realized he was angry, I could’ve resorted to self-deprecation ( to placate him. You might be reading this and thinking,  But it isn’t about this specific friendship. It’s about how I interact with people in general. I’m not sure how to avoid this flavor of ire. I’m not sure how to preemptively stifle these flares of jealousy before they ignite. For many years, the only LinkedIn profile I had was a joke. Not to brag, but I have more than 20 Twitter followers now. I made it on a whim for shits and giggles, but there was some underlying discomfort, too, which I was trying to manage through humor. I  LinkedIn. I knew how people use it—how they scroll through someone’s profile, casting judgment over all of their achievements (or lack thereof), reducing a person to their resumé. A charade that I’d eventually have little choice but to participate in—so many job applications required a LinkedIn profile. I didn’t want my accomplishments to be dissected—I didn’t want to do anything that might threaten others’ egos. Hence, jokes! In third grade, my classmates called me the class clown, but they also called me the second-smartest kid in the class (first place went to my math rival). If they were busy laughing, they wouldn’t hate me for how quickly I could complete my times tables. I don’t think eight-year-old Rona had the social awareness to understand jester’s privilege, and there are so many more reasons why I adore humor—truly, it makes the world go round—but even now, I sometimes find myself relying on it as a protective measure. Not everyone uses that tactic. Some of my friends keep a low-profile, no online presence, never talk about what they’re doing. Others are extremely discerning about who they forge relationships with, and only get close with people who don’t seem prone to envy. I’m still figuring out my own style. It feels imbalanced to write a post about others’ envy but to not discuss my own, but truthfully, as I got older, I became less preoccupied with comparing myself to other people. The change wasn’t one of moral goodness but self-assurance. I’m happy with my path with all of its twists and turns; I’m happy with who I am. This doesn’t make me  than anyone who might struggle with envy—first, I still have my moments of insecurity, and second, I think it’s a perfectly natural emotion and society would be more harmonious if it were socially acceptable to confess one’s envy. Maybe that’s why my favorite non-single song from Olivia Rodrigo’s  album is “jealousy, jealousy”. It’s admittedly surface-level—she never delves deeper into the root of her resentment—but she’s unafraid to make that angsty adolescent cognitive dissonance so explicit:  . Messy. But that’s what makes life interesting, no? here

there is a ddr ( dance dance revolution ) machine in the basement of  walker memorial . i have known this fact for at least a year, but didn’t bother actually checking out the machine until around two weeks ago, because i’ve never been good at rhythm games and have relatively slow reaction times so i assumed ddr would be a struggle this is what the ddr screen + pads setup looks like the basic mechanics of ddr are as follows: there are four pads on the ground, each corresponding to an arrow direction (up/down/left/right). players choose from a variety of songs; when a song begins, arrows begin moving from the bottom of the screen to the top, and the player’s job is to step on the pads at the same time that the corresponding arrows reach the top of the screen; you get points based on how well your footsteps match the onscreen arrow movements. usually the arrow patterns are designed to match the beats and rhythms of the song, so if played correctly you should feel like you’re moving in sync with the song example of a typical sequence of arrows i ended up enjoying ddr a lot more than i’d expected to, largely because the learning curve for beginners is well-designed and pretty satisfying. over the course of my first hour of gameplay i learned how to keep myself centered on the pads without looking at the ground (through a mix of muscle memory and leaning on the bar behind the machine), how to time my footsteps more precisely (by relying less on visual cues and more on the song audio), as well as more advanced gameplay mechanics like  jumps  (simultaneous arrows that require stepping on two pads at once) and  freezes  (long arrows that require holding down a pad for a sustained amount of time) example of a sequence containing both a freeze and a jump towards the end of my second ddr session i found a level i wanted to beat in my remaining week at mit. it was  grand escape , a song that features prominently in  weathering with you , one of my favorite anime movies. unfortunately it seemed like i was out of my depth – every time i tried  grand escape , i’d survive for the first four minutes, which were relatively beginner-friendly, and then i’d reach the climax of the song and my screen would fill up with arrows: consecutive jumps in the climax of grand escape while the rest of the song contained maybe one jump every ten or twenty beats, the climax had 27 jumps in a row. i simply did not have the processing power to react to two arrows at a time, coming in every beat at a tempo of 146 bpm or 2.43 beats per second, so i lost during the same section every time a few days later one of my friends (F) watched me attempt and fail  grand escape , and then we had the following conversation: F : i think you need to change the game settings and increase your onscreen arrow speed me : but if the arrows move up the screen faster, i’ll have less time to react to each one F : i don’t think your problem is not having enough time to react to the arrows. i think your problem is that there are so many arrows cluttering the screen during the climax that it’s interfering with your ability to read the arrows, and if there were less arrows onscreen you’d be able to process them faster me : but doesn’t having less arrows onscreen make it harder to prepare? like, don’t i want to be able to read the next two or three sets of arrows at the same time so i can plan better for them? F : you should never have to plan multiple beats in advance me:  oh… i took the advice and changed the arrow speed settings so that the arrows moved 2-3x faster than they previously did. here’s what the same part of the song looks like before and after the speedup: the left is grand escape with regular settings; the right is the same level with faster onscreen arrow speeds but the same musical tempo and footstep patterns it turns out my friend was correct – even though increasing the arrow speed meant i had less time to prepare for each beat, the decrease in screen clutter allowed me to read off the arrows much faster, and a few attempts later i was able to hit most of the jumps and beat the level nowhere near perfect, but at least i didn’t lose! in retrospect it’s almost comical how closely my struggles with ddr and  grand escape  mirrored my struggles with anxiety. you expend so much energy trying to look further into the future and plan more steps in advance, and you put so much on your plate that the clutter makes it hard to concentrate on anything at all; then when you encounter difficulties you tell yourself the answer is to  think even harder  and  plan even better . but maybe none of that is true; maybe what you needed all along was a way to worry less about the future, to clear out your plate and give yourself the space to focus on doing one thing well at a time

In July 2018, in my application to be a blogger, I left a note at the very end: One last thing: in Canada, we have approximately three oreo flavors. In the US, you have like twenty. I am fully committed, when I arrive at MIT in the fall, to trying each and every one of these flavours and writing a review at the end of the process. If hired as a blogger, I will guarantee you exclusive rights to the publishing of this review and all associated anecdotes and photos. It is now May 2023. I have been a blogger for five long (and excellent) years. I have tried SO MANY Oreo flavors. And the time has come for me to share what I learned with you. I have to admit up front my cardinal sin:  . I think it would almost be true to say that I’ve tried all the flavors sold in the U.S. in the past five years, but even this more limited statement may not be true: the more unusual ones are often only available for a month or two and I may have missed some while away or during the pandemic. Over the course of this project, I’ve also come to realize that there are many more flavors sold in other markets; I couldn’t possibly hope to try them all without bankrupting myself with import fees and burying myself in Oreos. So, this post is a best-effort — but if you make it to the end (or if you give up early due to length :P) I think you’ll agree that the effort was pretty good indeed. A few logistics: I’ll go through each flavor in the order I tried it and give a quick review and some anecdotes. Then I’ll wrap up with my overall thoughts and a tier list! In this post, I will not review the most common varieties of Oreos. These are ones that I’ve seen and eaten numerous times as a child in Canada: original, chocolate, and vanilla. Even if you haven’t tried them, I don’t think it would be helpful for me to describe them; these are the baseline against which all other Oreos can be compared. I’d recommend giving them a try, and they should be readily available in most locations. I also want to note that I won’t review every single flavor combination – for example, you can buy mint oreos, original oreo thins, and mint oreos thins. I won’t review mint oreo thins, instead counting them as simply a combination of oreo thins + mint oreos. This is partly because they’re typically very similar and partly because not doing so increases the number of unique flavors to an unmanageable extent. Freshman year got off to a great start because after I mentioned my Oreo quest to my new roommate, she brought me two interesting flavors to try! I thought that was really lovely of her, especially because she had come in on a plane from the Bay Area and had to pack all of her stuff into a huge suitcase. The two flavors she brought ended up being one of the best and worst I would try throughout the whole project, which is pretty funny. Choose carefully: one always lies and one always tells the truth… : really quite good. The cookie itself is differently flavored, not just the creme, which often sets the better flavors apart. The cookie has a graham cracker kind of feel to it, which helps to cut the sweetness of the creme. The creme itself was a little disappointing, tasting more ‘sweet’ rather than actually ‘cinnamon’-y. extremely weird. The front of the packages advertises that the cookies have “soy nut inclusions”, and to be honest that descriptor sounds exactly how the soy nut inclusions tasted: surprising and kind of bad. They did give the filling a nice texture, with a bit of soft crunch a la lucky charms marshmallows. But ultimately, the cookie itself tasted bland and the creme’s flavor was weird in an unpleasant way. : I bought these on my very first grocery shopping trip of college! I felt like a real adult walking into the store and quickly learned why real adults write shopping lists, as I got overwhelmed and forgot all of the real food I had intended to buy. I found that the peanut butter was too strong here and made it hard to taste the chocolate (but I like chocolate more than PB, so this could be a bonus to someone who feels the other way). The sweetness balance felt good, though, which makes this better than many other varieties. : I bought these when our
 
GRT ⁠ 01 Now called a GRA and sometimes called an RA elsewhere; a graduate student who lived on our floor and gave us life advice. , with not a lot else going on, making it not horrible but not particularly appealing.  These were an IAP purchase. My grocery shopping always shoots through the roof in IAP as I stock back up after finals and winter break, and because I have more time to cook. I really really liked peppermint bark! There were little crunchy pieces throughout the filling that gave it a fun texture (but without the weird taste of rocky road trip). The flavor wasn’t too sweet or weird; it was actually quite light overall, and I almost wanted it to be stronger. This desire kept me going back for more Oreos — actually wanting to eat more after the first one or two was a rare occurrence during this project. (I proceeded to get very hosed and hit the freshman credit limit freshman spring; I have few memories of this time and even fewer Oreo reviews.) The next two flavors, I actually did buy in Canada! I went home for the summer and tried these with my parents. These are an exception to my rule to typically not try the combo flavors because you actually can’t get the pistachio flavor in the regular Oreo format! Not sure why, as the pistachio thins were great. The flavor is definitely more on the artificial side (think pistachio ice cream), but still delicious, and there’s a nice balance where as you take a bite, the chocolate cookie starts out stronger but the nutty pistachio comes through at the end. I think a more gently-flavored cookie would have made these just perfect. Honestly, the dark chocolate Oreos were just fine. They weren’t that different from regular chocolate Oreos (which I admittedly love), and although the chocolate flavor was a bit stronger, they were also a bit sweeter which felt counter to the typical expectations for dark chocolate. Ultimately, they were too sweet for us. : These were another IAP purchase (notice how sophomore fall disappeared? Let’s call that another poor decision with respect to time management.) The caramel flavor was a bit artificial, but not too bad. The coconut was supposedly in small chips, but they weren’t very noticeable either texturally or flavor-wise, making these feel like they were just caramel flavored. They were  sweet which just made them hard to eat (you may be noticing that this is an overall theme with the weird flavors). About a month and a half after buying the caramel Oreos, the pandemic hit. I spent the first six months at home in Canada with my parents, then moved into an apartment in Cambridge with friends for my junior year. For most of this time, we were getting our groceries delivered; that, combined with a general feeling that the world was a little short on joy, led to a lack of new Oreo flavors in my life. I did try two, though: Another one that was just “fine”. It felt like a blander version of the normal chocolate Oreo. I don’t think you would notice the marshmallow if you weren’t looking for it, but with careful attention it does come through and is pleasant, if light. A similar experience but somewhat better. My original notes read: “Tastes like you took 30% of the flavor out of a chocolate Oreo and then put 15% hazelnut back”. I like hazelnut a lot, so this was a win for me. I also liked that they weren’t too sweet, maybe because they were more lightly-flavored overall. At this point in the post, you’ve made it through exactly half of all the Oreos. If you’re like, “whaaat, really?!” — me too, man. Senior year was back on campus, baby! Knowing that the end for me was coming nearer, but the Oreo list wasn’t getting any shorter, I made a concerted effort to try to get through all the flavors I hadn’t had yet. A lot of the ones left were ones I hadn’t tried because I didn’t think I would like them, so I started bringing them to blogger meetings so that other people would help me finish them. This one is not. it. It feels like they took vanilla Oreos and just made them worse — sweeter, more artificial in texture and flavor. It does look pretty though! Opening the package felt like getting suffocated with an artificial-coffee-flavored pillow. The Oreos themselves tasted a lot better than they smelled, but that’s saying very little. I thought I would dislike them because I don’t like the taste of coffee, but actually, they only tasted slightly like (fake) coffee; mostly they just tasted overwhelmingly and disgustingly sweet. Again, I thought I might dislike these because I don’t like
 
the taste of mint, ⁠ 02 To such an extreme extent that I use kids' toothpaste to avoid the mint-flavored kind  These were pretty good! A welcome relief after the last few. They weren’t as strongly spiced as real gingerbread typically is, and they were still a little too sweet, but overall the sweet-spice balance wasn’t bad at all. Another entry in the “textured with small pieces” category, but I felt like the pieces were a little too small to be noticeable. This mostly just tasted like sugar, but in fairness, that’s also a pretty good description of actual toffee; there was at least a   bit of a faint burnt/browned flavor. I kicked off my last year by finally getting my hands on  Oreos, which are only sold during (obvs) July and which I’d struggled to find for several years. These are exciting because they have a different gimmick! There are little crunchy pieces, but they’re actually  and they pop in your mouth. The Oreos themselves tasted boring and crappy, but the pop rocks were actually super fun. They popped on a bit of a delay, which made for a fun aftertaste after eating the main Oreo. If the flavor was better, these would’ve been awesome. another classic but time-limited option. I was unconsciously imagining pumpkin pie without realizing it and was a little apprehensive, but these taste like the spice rather than the pumpkin and were pretty good! They were strongly flavored enough that they actually felt fall-appropriate.  These supposedly have neapolitan-ice-cream flavored creme and “waffle cone” flavored cookies. What is waffle cone flavor? Bland. I had expected the creme to be in stripes, but instead it was stacked, which meant the Oreo tasted super different depending on which direction you held it as you ate it. The vanilla mostly disappeared, but it was fun to be able to choose whether to eat a chocolate Oreo or a strawberry one. Both did an okay job of replicating ice cream flavors, but were, as always, much too sweet. In case you, like me, had never heard of a “brookie”, it is the combination of a brownie and a cookie. This makes sense as a treat that you could bake, but it does not really make sense as a flavor for an Oreo, which is already a cookie, to have. The package advertises that there are three stacked flavors of creme: “brownie, original, and cookie dough”. Like neapolitan, in practice this mostly means depending on how you hold the cookie, you’re eating a regular Oreo or a chocolate Oreo, both of which are fine but neither of which are very interesting. The chocolate one did have my fave little crunchy bits! A typical weird flavor – these mostly just tasted like sugar with a very faint hint of snickerdoodle (although in fairness, many actual snickerdoodles are also pretty faintly flavored). Extremely mediocre. These were actually kind of cool — I had expected them to be a dupe of dark chocolate, but they genuinely did taste  somehow! Maybe the creme was softer? Not sure, but it was interesting. The flavor was more like regular chocolate than dark chocolate, and as always they were too sweet. Overall, to be honest, most of these flavors totally sucked. They were all super sweet and either tasted bland or weird. A few flavors made it to the point of “almost as good as the original Oreos, but I would never buy them instead of the original”; even fewer actually made it to “as good as the original or better”. Here’s my tier list:  (better than regular Oreos): Oreo thins, double stuff, peppermint bark  (equal to regular Oreos): regular Oreos, chocolate Oreos, pistachio thins  (not as good as regular Oreos, but I would still buy and enjoy them): cinnamon bun, pumpkin spice, gingerbread  (not good enough to buy, but I would eat them if offered): vanilla, chocolate marshmallow, dark chocolate, red velvet, chocolate hazelnut, Brookie-O  (if I picked one up and took a bite, I would finish it, but reluctantly): chocolate peanut butter pie, mint, caramel coconut, toffee crunch, Fourth of July, Neapolitan, snickerdoodle, blackout cake  (if I took a bite by mistake, I would throw out the rest): birthday cake, rocky road trip, coffee I think if more care had been put into each of these flavors, Oreo could have done a much better job with most of them. But I guess they got my money anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ And in any case, I had a ton of fun doing this project over the last few years. It was nice to have something that could take a backseat when I hosed, but that I could pick back up when I wanted to, bring up at parties, and laugh about with my friends. We’d dissect and diss on each flavor together and have a great time doing it. I regretfully admit that I will likely continue trying every new Oreo flavor I see at the store, despite knowing that they will probably not be very good. Who knows? Maybe years from now, when I share new Oreos with my new friends, I’ll think back to all the people I shared them with here.

 It’s a question that many of my friends have asked me, and one that I often ask myself. Usually, I default to my  “origin story” sophomore year @thefrenchdormitory 
nourishment to others. ⁠ 01 cj: good ol <em>nourishment</em> uh huh The results 
macabre, ⁠ 02 cj: im not convinced jacky knows what macabre means. to be clear it does not mean “delicious”   CJ commented that my freshman year blogpost screamed of “too much time on P/NR.” While that was certainly the case three years ago, my life has gotten much busier since.
 
Dental school applications, ⁠ 03 cj: did you know jacky got a perfect score on whatever exam you have to take for dental school? that's not true but i hear he aced it

Like many at MIT, I am guilty of relentless perfectionism. I have allowed this “pursuit of excellence”, which has helped me tremendously in my career thus far, to trickle down into my avocations. I only realized this recently, when I looked at my schedule and realized that all my free time was filled with overblown pastimes that almost feel like trainings for alternate careers.

East meets West. Surgery meets cooking. When a Taiwanese silkie chicken and an American Giannone chicken are sutured together, encased in a salt crust, and baked, the normally dry silkie chicken takes on the moistness of regular chicken, while the regular chicken is imbued with the rich flavor of silkie chicken. Inspired by chef Alain Passard’s  mi-poulet mi-canard  To quote my philosopher friend Keanu again: “You are the questions you seek the answers to and the problems you attempt to solve.” Much of my cooking is driven by, on the most basic level, the desire to know what X would taste like when prepared using Y technique. I certainly still have my affinity for offal and exotic meats – a few days ago I heard about a chef in Taiwan who is making sushi from giant   isopods, and I’m tempted to fly home just for a tasting. More recently, however, I explore by combining all the different lessons I’ve learned during the past few years. The monkfish dish shown in Figure 4 is a great example – it was wrapped in caul fat which I learned to use during junior year; served with a sauce I formulated as a sophomore; and prepared using   techniques I picked up in freshman fall. What made this dish possible was not just knowing the techniques themselves, but having the imagination to combine the techniques in my mind and envisioning an end product. It turns out that the finished dish tasted very similar to what I imagined it would be like – silky smooth, balanced, and without any of the monkfish’s

Even though metaphors for food, cooking, and ingestion abound, there is no “digestion” – the eaten are not assimilated into those who eat them. The process of eating does not proceed, but rather, only repeats and extends. On the surface, this seems to contradict many of the food metaphors in the  , such as the description of Hell as a “toothed gullet” swallowing sinners, in canto 13. However, I reconciled this fact with my food-centric reading of the   by realizing that in a certain way, the process of eating itself can be timeless. Of course, there is the physical process of transformation during digestion, but when we remember a meal, we hardly ever focus on the process by which food is transformed into feces inside our gullet. Instead, our memory of food is fixed at a specific point in time, at the vanishing instant of when we encounter the food in our mouths. We remember the flavors and aromas of that one instant, long after the physical particles of food have degraded and scattered. In eating, therefore, food is made timeless: transformed from a physical body to an eternal profile of taste. Few processes capture this consecration of perishable moments into lasting memories better than winemaking. Last year I made banana wine using bananas from MIT’s famous Banana Lounge (Figure 9).

“So, Andi, let’s talk about your  accomplishments  from this semester. Was your research output impactful enough to  lead to a start-up ?” I just sat there and shook my head in silence. “No? What about a  publication  in a peer-reviewed journal? Or at least a  patent ? I know MIT kids like you love inventing cool new things.” Again, I had nothing. Trust me – I would’ve loved to have either of those things, but my semester just didn’t shake out that way. “Come on, at least tell me you  presented at a conference  or  to the EECS department at large .” What would I have told them? That my experiments  didn’t  work? That the effect I investigated is likely  not  experimentally realizable? “So what exactly did you accomplish then? You know this question is required, right? Whatever, just make up some  other  thing.” Of course, this was not a real conversation with a person at MIT, but rather me filling out a particular section of the semesterly UROP evaluation form. And so, with the same regret I’ve felt the previous semester, I checked the “Other” box and moved on to the rest of the form. What is a UROP anyway? A UROP  –  U ndergraduate  R esearch  O pportunities  P rogram – allows MIT undergrads like me to collaborate with renowned MIT faculty on cutting-edge research. Typically, a student would find a lab studying an area of interest and work on a project alongside a grad student or postdoc while the UROP office or the lab funds their research. UROPs are wildly popular, with  92% of undergrads  doing one at some point. Understandably so – students gain technical expertise and research experience while labs benefit from the (effectively free) labour of highly-motivated undergrads; overall, a win-win situation for everyone involved. Additionally, many UROP projects sound extremely cool – who wouldn’t want to work on  laser-induced mind control  at MIT? But probably the most enticing part of doing a UROP (at least for me) is the prospect of applying the skills I learned in classes to create a tangible product. Did you know that Collier Memorial outside the Stata Center was  designed and built, in part, by UROP students ? And that
 
iRobot ⁠ 01 The company that makes Roombas. partially the product of a successful UROP experience ? And just a few days ago, Kathleen ‘23 had  her research  published in Nature and featured in MIT News! Unfortunately, my UROP experiences thus far have not been nearly as successful as the ones listed above. I’ve been with my current lab for the past two semesters. In the fall, I fabricated magnetic memory devices using two exciting new materials, only to discover that they didn’t work because the crystal structures were incompatible. And in the spring, I tried to simulate a hypothetical physical effect that never emerged in the dozens of experiments I tried over the semester. And it feels a bit disappointing At MIT, I’m surrounded by incredibly successful people with incredibly successful research projects. I know students who discovered a major security flaw in Apple’s content recognition system as part of an MIT class project and presented their findings at

These people pour enormous amounts of effort into their work and don’t go around boasting about their successes ⁠ 03 Obviously, there are exceptions, but this is true for almost all of MIT. right  that I’m doing  wrong ? Why do so many people have posters, publications, and/or patents to showcase their UROP work while I only have experiments that don’t work? Am I just bad at doing research? In some ways, the answer to that last question could be “yes”. I initially struggled to understand things in the lab because I started the UROP without knowing any quantum mechanics, and I didn’t spend as much time in the lab as I should have because I was overcommitted in the past two semesters. Because of that, I worry about how those around me, like my UROP mentor, my lab’s PI, and my peers, would judge me. With MIT providing me with such amazing resources and guidance, I was afraid of being seen as incompetent; unable to get any of my experiments to work. My insecurities are amplified further by the UROP evaluation form and a few people at MIT I’ve interacted with who make it seem like getting publishable results out of UROPs is the norm. “Oh, just publish a few good papers in your field.”, I recall one professor commenting when I asked about graduate school admissions, “That shouldn’t be too hard for an MIT student like you.” Sometimes, I feel like I’m also a part of this problem. As an
 
associate advisor ⁠ 04 A student who provides academic support and resources to first-year students. But that’s just how a lot of UROPs go Upon further reflection and talking with some of my professors from this semester, I’ve realized that my research experience is surprisingly common across the undergrad population. It still kind of sucks that I didn’t quite advance humanity’s scientific knowledge as I’d hoped, but I feel considerably less bad about it now. Firstly, most students who do UROPs do not get to publish their results either; the stuff I see in the news is the cream of the crop in undergrad research. After all, the publication process is long and arduous, as I learned in my communication-intensive classes this semester, so huge kudos to all my peers who have published before. (The numbers reflect this too – MIT publishes  fewer than 2000 science papers annually , with grad students and professors accounting for the vast majority of MIT’s academic output.) All this to say that getting a publication out of a UROP, especially at my level, is probably not a realistic goal to set in the first place. The publication process, as described by a professor in 6.2600 (micro/nano processing tech). Secondly, it’s okay if things don’t initially work in research. When I showed my results from this past semester to my UROP mentor and PI, they were unexpectedly pleased with my work even though my simulations hadn’t worked as I’d hoped. As they explained, the insights we gain from knowing what  doesn’t  work are just as important as knowing what  does . For example, my simulations taught them to avoid using
 
permalloy ⁠ 05 The magnetic material I was using in my simulations. The nanofabrication class I’ve previously written about  did a great job of teaching me this lesson. In preparing us for research in microelectronics, it’s one of the very few classes at MIT where the final project doesn’t have to work to be considered successful. Although having a functional end product was satisfying, I learned much more from messing up intermediate steps and then reflecting on what went wrong. (As an aside, I think it’s rather unfortunate that researchers don’t publicize their experiments that didn’t work, because others will ultimately try those same experiments and obtain the same results.) But most importantly, I still managed to achieve my main goal for the research experience – to learn about nanofabrication and magnetic computing devices. Sure, travelling to conferences and publishing a paper would’ve been nice, but I believe the whole point for many UROPs at MIT is to learn research techniques outside of classes and gain exposure to exciting new fields. (And plus, I still have at least four more semesters left at MIT to get something to work!) A happy ending after all I must confess that up until now, I’ve been slightly misleading about the UROP evaluation form. The part I showed in the introduction was the only part of the form I disagreed with; the rest contained valuable questions to help me reflect on my experience and plan for future semesters. For example, the evaluation form emphasizes the importance of setting goals and expectations at the beginning of a project, which I’ve found immensely helpful for planning this past semester’s project. Although the results of the past two semesters have been somewhat disappointing, I think it’s good to experience disappointment this early in my career before I start doing research full-time. Thanks to my UROP experiences, I now have much more realistic expectations about academia. I also learned a lot about what kind of work I want to do in the future; for example, although computational work allows me to get results much more easily and quickly, I still find experimental work more interesting. Despite the disillusionment that often comes along with them, I find that UROPs really do live up to their names – opportunities for undergrads like me to do research, not only on cutting-edge technology but also about their personal preferences. #UROP

my last concert with the mit ohms, my a cappella group, happened around two weeks ago usually we hire a sound company to handle sound on the day of the concert – they bring in their own equipment, set it up, do live mixing during the concert, and then tear down their equipment afterwards. this semester our sound company canceled four days before the concert, and four days isn’t enough notice to book another company so we proceeded without a typical sound company and did everything ourselves we spent the days before the concert contacting as many music-adjacent mit groups as possible to borrow equipment from them. ultimately we ended up getting: 5 wired mics, a mixer, an amp, and 2 speakers + speaker stands from  av ; 8 wireless mics, a speaker, and a mixer from  next sing ; 16 wireless mics from  mtg ; 10 wireless mics and a mixer from  synco . this was a bit overkill since our group only had 13 members total, but it was the right choice because we didn’t know which groups would respond in time and weren’t sure about equipment quality or cross-compatibility between different sets of mics, mixers, and speakers so the safe bet was to acquire as much as possible the day before the concert we did a quick sound test and confirmed the equipment from synco and mtg wouldn’t work with our speakers. then i built my first sound system, connecting the 5 av mics to the av mixer to the amp to the speakers, and it worked! it was cool to actually figure out how to put everything together myself, after having relied on external sound companies to blackbox away all the details for the first three years of my time in college of course 5 mics wasn’t enough, so we also set up the 8 next sing mics + mixer + speaker, giving us the 13 mics we needed. for a while we thought we’d need to run the av and next sing sound systems in parallel, and have someone manage both mixers separately during the concert, which would’ve been painful and would have resulted in very limited mixing and weird audio imbalances because people sitting in different locations would hear different mixes. then i had the idea of setting up the systems in series instead of in parallel, with the 8 next sing mics feeding into the next sing mixer and the mixer output feeding into the av mixer as a single input. this would still require managing two separate mixers, but would solve the audio imbalance problem because all 13 mics would output through the same set of speakers we tried this and it worked! except it turned out the next sing mics were quite noisy and the next sing mixer was not powerful enough to remove the static, so that wasn’t ideal either. then we realized there was another sound company in cambridge that we could borrow 13 wireless mics + a compatible mixer from, so we acquired those the night before the concert the day of the concert i arrived six hours early with some alumni to set up the new equipment. our final setup had the 13 wireless mics feeding into the new mixer, feeding into the av amp and speakers, as well as an extra output into the next sing speaker to serve as a monitor during the concert (a monitor is a speaker pointed at the performers instead of the audience, so that they can hear themselves). i thought it was cool that our final setup combined equipment from three different systems, and it fun to talk through the optimal locations to place the speakers and cables and other equipment; i think i got better at event planning in the process i won’t say much about the actual concert other than that it went fine and a decent number of people showed up and i was exhausted by the end because i’d essentially been in the same room from 8am to 8pm for setup, rehearsal, performance, and teardown. ohms time commitment the week of concerts is usually 15-20 hours but this time i think it was closer to 35-40 for me because of all the equipment logistics we had to deal with afterwards it took me a few days to process that i was done with a cappella for at least the foreseeable future and probably done with south asian fusion music for life. i didn’t want it to stop, but we didn’t have any more activities planned, so i started writing – thoughts on publicity and organization, commentary on all the arrangements and all the music i’ve ever written, pages and pages of documentation which nobody asked for but which i wrote anyway because there was nothing else left for me to do one of my favorite videos is a behind-the-scenes  clip  about the filming of the  lord of the rings  trilogy. in the video, peter jackson (the director) is shooting the last scene involving elijah wood (who plays frodo, the protagonist). peter gets the shot he wanted but continues asking for more takes because he’s not ready to say goodbye to elijah yet, and then at the end he breaks down and thanks elijah repeatedly all of which is to say that i have no idea what to do with my interest in music now that i’m no longer in the ohms. maybe get into composition or music production? experiment with interactive music systems and text-to-music conversions? i expect to continue making music in the future, but probably of a very different nature than what i have done in the past and i have no idea what that will entail

And sometimes it gets quiet enough that I forget about how tired I’m feeling, and for a moment, it’d feel like I could live forever. And maybe you’d feel the same way. And then we could tell each other stories. But until then, I hope you enjoy reading mine. What does it take to get to know someone? Here, I’ll tell you something you want to know, and something I want you to know. You probably want to know my name, CJ, or my class year, ’23, or where I’m living, East Campus. Here’s something I want you to know: I’m graduating in a semester, and that thought terrifies me, because I don’t think I’m ready for the real world just yet. You probably want to know about the things I like. We could talk for hours about Vampire Survivors and interactive fiction and compiler optimization. Or maybe you want to know what board games I like? I like Roll for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders and NMBR 9. Here’s something I want you to know: I have a particular taste in  music Maybe you want to see some places I like. We could go to the ESP office in the Student Center, or the SIPB office just upstairs. We could walk down Revere Beach, and I’ll complain about how I hate getting sand on my feet. Or we could go to 66-110, my favorite lecture hall on campus, even if I’ve never taken a class there. Here’s something I want to do. We’ll go to a random lounge. And we’ll talk about AI, and anxiety, and faith. And sometimes it gets quiet enough that I forget about how tired I’m feeling, and for a moment, it’d feel like I could live forever. And maybe you’d feel the same way. And then we could tell each other stories. But until then, I hope you enjoy reading mine. What does it take to get to know someone? A few words, a few sentences, a few pages, a whole book, more? From the fact you’re reading this, you already know a few things about me. My name is CJ, and I’m an MIT ’23. You can see my avatar, which is what I looked like, once. If you clicked Keep Reading to read the rest of this, you can see above that I’m in Courses 18 and 6-3, which are Mathematics and Computer Science. Is that it? We could talk about the things I like, if that will help. My favorite video game genre is deckbuilding roguelike, like Backpack Hero, which I’ve been playing a lot of lately. More academic interests include model theory, dependent types, fan studies, and linguistic typology. I like Galaxy Trucker and Roll for the Galaxy, which, despite the similar names, are unrelated board games. I like pop  music Or we could go on an adventure. Many of my favorite places aren’t accessible right now because they’re in the Student Center: the ESP office, the SIPB office, La Verde’s. Lobdell and La Sala, W20-407. When East Campus will close for renovations later this summer, more of my favorite places will disappear: my old room, the TV Lounge, KL, my new room. We can learn, experimentally, what exactly it takes to get to know someone. We can talk about institutional change and the meaning of distance. And maybe it’d get quiet enough that I forget about how tired I’m feeling, and for a moment, it’d feel like I could live forever. And maybe you’d feel the same way. And then we could tell each other stories. But until then, I hope you enjoy reading mine.

i was finished with school work since about two weeks ago i have lots of things i could be doing and i am not doing any of them because i am too busy being sad and burnt out i’ve been spending my time playing video games and walking around and being on voice calls and scrolling through wikipedia pages and getting information and not doing anything with it i could be working on personal projects or gph or learning piano or packing or whatever instead i am sitting and lying in bed and watching all my friends fade away from campus as i say final goodbyes because i am going out (not with a bang but with a whimper)

As per my previous post, I’ve been going through a lot of shit! But there’s also a lot of incredibly fun and freeing things that I’ve been doing this semester that I figured I should talk about. I turned 21 in February! I don’t talk a lot about party culture on the blogs just because I find it kind of weird, maybe a little jarring. I prefer to keep my blog life and, I guess, like, party/hookup culture life separate, but I figured in an effort of maintaining my brand of transparency I’d just touch on it a little bit. I love going to parties! I love going to bars! I love going to clubs! And I’ve been doing a LOT of that this semester. There’s a common club that a lot of college students go to particularly on Thursday nights so usually my weekends consist of me going out with a bunch of friends on Thursday, having a great time, and then going to other bars/frats/clubs on Friday and Saturday. It’s been horrible for my sleep schedule and for my homework schedule,   I cope by telling myself the ever so common mantra “It’s senior spring, you deserve this.” I’ve been going to new frats that I’ve never really been to before and meeting so many new people which is also really nice. Before, I spent the majority of my time at ZBT for obvious reasons, so it’s been so fun branching out and seeing the different frats around MIT. Previous Next For spring break, I went to visit my family on Big Island in Hawai’i. I took this as an opportunity to really cool down and learn about myself and try and center myself post-breakup. I played a LOT of Hades and wore a lot of cute bathingsuits and really just bonded with my family. I also ate SO much delicious food. Previous Next I’m really grateful to have such a good relationship with my family and this trip honestly was so monumental to my healing process. I heard so many fun family stories like how my aunt and uncle met, embarrassing stories from my mom’s childhood, and just learning about island life in general. It felt so very peaceful to escape my life for a bit and just live like an Animal Crossing resident on the Big Island. I also met Michelle Zauner, aka Japanese Breakfast, aka author of best-selling novel  . I read this book in one sitting on the plane and sobbed my eyes out and it was such a healing, beautiful experience to really just throw myself into a book like that. So it felt fitting to go to a Q&A and book signing event with her and go through all those big, big feelings again. I also then took myself out on a solo date of sorts and got ramen and contemplated life. I got new piercings! Maybe a stereotypical breakup thing to do. But I got my second lobes done. I plan to get another helix piercing on my right ear and then an industrial on my left and maybe some tattoos. I went with my friend Jess, and she got her first helix! On a total whim, I went to Atlanta! And I saw my Salesforce friends and some friends I met online, as well as Julie, an MIT and dphie alum! I toured Georgia Tech, went to the aquarium, ate really good food, and just shot the shit with all my friends. Previous Next I essentially filled them in on the giant emotional crisis I’ve been going on since February which was really just like, relieving to get their input and tell people about my problems. And of course hear about their lives, too. Perhaps an unpopular opinion but Atlanta reminded me a lot of Los Angeles, with like, its horrible traffic, bad infrastructure, and need for cars. It was weird. On yet ANOTHER total whim, I bought tickets to Coachella and I went with bestie Emma and her family. I will admit I originally bought this ticket to see Frank Ocean, who then proceeded to drop out of the festival while I was on my way to the airport, BUT… Nonetheless, this weekend was   what I needed. I described it to friends as full-on Dorian Gray hedonism. Pure self-indulgence, satisfaction, etc. in one sinful three day festival. A lot of unhealthy habits, for sure, that I won’t delve into too much on the blogs. But it was so fun and lovely to just be in full concert mode for 72 hours. I feel like I’m most myself when I’m at a concert, surrounded by people singing songs loudly. It makes me just so aware of my…my human-ness? I guess. And so it was just so lovely to be in that state all weekend. I saw so many fantastic artists, namely Blackpink, Bad Bunny, Rosalía, Kali Uchis, fourtet, Skrillex, fredagain, Willow Smith, and so many more. It was great. I would 100% go again next year if Emma and her family went again. It was also so sweet to just have a weekend with me and Emma and her family. I’ve known Emma since CPW and I just love being around her all the time, I think she balances me out so well. She so easily made friends with so many people at Coachella and I know my experience wouldn’t have been the same at all without her. I am also so grateful to her family for taking me in as a last minute straggler! Previous Next Springfest!!!! It’s here again!!! I did not help plan it this year because I am simply too hosed BUT this year we had the lovely lovely Doechii perform. I absolutely pissed and shit myself when I found out the artist for this year was Doechii because I listed her as my main inspiration for rappers for my rap class that I’m taking this year so it was absolutely surreal to see her on stage. Her stage presence and just command of the stage is truly something incredible. I adore her with all my heart. She also grabbed my phone and filmed with it during the concert, and also I got the setlist at the end of the concert. Life made. Previous Next

I remember the moment that the East Campus renovation announcement email hit our inboxes. I was a freshman. Covid
 
pods ⁠ 01 you got up to five other people who you could interact with normally; you had to remain socially distanced from everyone else Renovations actually got pushed back a year, letting me enjoy two and a half years at East Campus. Never before have I experienced such intense feelings of belonging and joy, tidbits of which I’ve documented  on the blogs Two Fridays ago, I threw most of my belongings in too many cardboard boxes. The dust on my walls and shelves traced out the silhouettes of what used to live on them, like ghosts. The circular base of a cat butt figurine. Rectangles of pictures from freshman year. I hate packing. It’s so physically tiring, but I also hate the way it shoves into my face, “you’ll never live here again.” I
 
anti-hazed ⁠ 02 tEp is a co-ed fraternity that is very against hazing new <del>pledges</del> peldges (aka new members), so much so that peldges are entitled to politely anti-haze current members into doing tasks of their wishing. also i guess i'm a frat boi now :O I bumped into some of my graduating friends as I ran around campus taking care of moving out related errands. I wish I could sit down and have a real conversation, but a badly lit selfie and a quick hug would have to do. One day we’ll meet up again in whichever city we happen to be in at the same time and complain about shitty coworkers or the economy or whatever. But it stings not knowing when “one day” will be. I don’t want to say goodbye, unwilling to let go of the certainty that comes with “today.” I spent all of Monday night finishing up two final projects. Notifications from both classes’ group chats went off the entire night, a periodic reminder that my time at East Campus was ticking to an end, that I’m stuck in my room shorting microcontrollers instead of late night baking in the chaotic Tetazoo kitchen for the last time. I was dreading Tuesday night, where I’d have to fall asleep to an empty room with bare walls. So I didn’t, instead stumbling around hall in a sleepless stupor. At 6am Wednesday morning, I took one last glance at the East Campus that I knew and loved and left for the airport. Four flights and three layovers later, I arrived in China. This trip was a “now or never” deal: my parents had wanted to make this trip after my high school graduation to visit extended family, but pandemic restrictions made getting a visa impossible until now. With rising political tensions between China and the US and Taiwan, who knows for how long borders will remain open. This was reason I left MIT so early, before I could properly say goodbye to the people and places I cared about. This trip has been full of hellos. I’ve met so many first/second/third cousins and great aunts and uncles for the first time in recallable memory. It’s an unfamiliar but exhilarating feeling, experiencing what like it’s like to have a large extended family in the same area. Squeezing twenty people around the same table in a restaurant. Listening to relatives drunkenly recall stories from childhood. Walking two blocks to one relative’s place, and another two blocks to a different relative’s place. But I keep thinking about this trip as one for saying goodbye. The last time I visited China prior to this time was ten years ago, with one of my most vivid memories being my maternal great grandparents waving goodbye from their apartment’s window. I remember thinking that this can’t be our last goodbye, but in a few days we’ll be setting up their shared gravestone. A lot has happened during the pandemic and me going off to college that my parents has shielded from me: I didn’t know that my maternal great grandma had passed until I asked my mom how she was doing multiple months later. I didn’t know until now that my paternal grandma’s health has declined so much from when I’ve last seen her. “Talk to your grandma as much as you can while you’re here, okay?” I can read between lines to understand what my mom is actually trying to tell me. A wave of guilt washed over me for having complained earlier about missing end of the year celebratory events, forgoing a Spinning Arts retreat, and  OX’ing My paternal grandparents lived with my parents and me in the US until my sophomore year of high school. I could go on and on about how they did so much for me growing up. But frankly I was an awful, unappreciative granddaughter, and there’s so much I have to say about this that will stay in my private notes. These past few days, I’ve been trying to talk my grandparents about anything, holding onto the time I have left with them like water in my hands. I’ve babbled about Spinning Arts, a tailless cat I met in Wales, how I injection molded the
 
2.008 ⁠ 03 Design & Manufacturing II But I’d much rather say “wo ai ni” a hundred times over than my last “zai jian” — “goodbye.” Zai jian translates directly to “see you again,” which feels cruel to say if I can’t guarantee for it to be true.

As the name implies, this is going to be a tier ranking of all thirty three classes I took over these past four years at MIT + explanations. I’m leaving! So I can say whatever I want! Raaaraaaaa nothing matters rAaaaaaaa My favorite class of all time (hence why it’s first, yes order matters.) I’ve already written  an extensive blogpost I   write a blogpost about this class eventually, I just have been too hosed this semester to do so. But this is a great class. Honestly one of the hardest classes I’ve ever taken at MIT, just because rapping and then writing raps just isn’t a skill I’ve ever tried out before (and I’m assuming not many people have, really) but I learned SO much. Through this class, I just started thinking about words, speech, and language a lot differently. I tried thinking of obscure references, ways to spin words to have multiple meanings, clever wordplays that I could include in my raps. I even made a notes doc in my phone to write them down in case they came to me. (I would write them here but a lot of them are…incredibly NSFW so it’s probably not super appropriate LMAO!) This is actually tied for second with the rap class. I loved this class a lot — I took it last spring + TA’d it this semester and though it was a lot of reading and the discussions were semi-intimidating, I feel as though I really learned so much and began to interact with/look at the Internet a lot differently. (I think about hidden labor a LOT. Like far too much, maybe.) I wish I knew about Joaquin’s classes before my senior spring, but alas. Joaquin is one of the best professors I’ve ever had at MIT. In this class, we evaluated superhero comics through the lens of race and gender and it really opened my eyes and changed the way in which I consumed media. For example, we’d look at The Batman movie through a more critical lens and ask questions such as what is vigilanteism? What differentiates a superhero from the police force? Who determines who has what authority? How is what Batman does different from police brutality? While sometimes yes it is good and nice to just consume media for the way that it is and do a ‘haha superhero cool brain off’, it’s also important to view media critically and understand “What narrative is being spun about what groups right now? What message is this subconsciously or consciously trying to push?”and this class taught me how to ask those questions more consistently. This class is fantastic just in the fact that it’s a free for all kind of thing. Anything you wanna make, you just tell Dave and he will help you out. I’ll make a post also on all the things I’ve done and made this semester, but I learned how to laser cut, 3D print, rug tuft, and more. I wish I went to this class more — this semester was hard and I often skipped it because I just couldn’t make it or didn’t have the mental capacity, but I really did love it. There is something so therapeutic in making something. I said this in my note to Dave, but I entered MIT not really feeling as though I was MIT enough, and even until now, I still felt that way at times. I thought it was too late for me to make things, thought it was too late to learn and I was too scared to ask and didn’t know where to go. But when I got accepted into this class, I realized I was given another chance to learn all the things I was too scared to do. Dave did such a great job at creating such an open, warm and welcoming environment where anyone could ask any question. No project was too big, no question too simple or complex — he treated all of us with such respect and kindness. This class really did change my life. This semester’s been so fucking hard and being able to just push the difficulties of the world away for a bit and spend three hours really dedicating yourself to a crochet project or your rug tufting is something so so sacred and important. I felt the same peace I feel whenever I play guitar or piano or sing. This class helped me find peace, and for that, it’s one of my favorite classes at MIT. Along the same thread of ES.100, this class was a lovely respite from all these difficult and burdensome this semester. I fell out of music a long time ago because I threw myself into my studies, but by taking this class, I was able to fall in love with music again. From this class, I found myself practicing piano 3-5 times a week before or after class in the music rooms near the classroom. Garo was also an incredibly supportive and kind professor; I would often email him asking for the time signature of certain songs and he’d take the time to reply. Overall, just an encouraging and kind class that helped me a lot. I didn’t expect to rank this class so highly but as I thought about it, this class gave me a lot of confidence my sophomore year when I took it.  I’ve also blogged about this class already so you can read all the reasons why I loved it. For this class, I traveled to Spain for a month and studied Spanish literature and history. It’s a pretty good deal and the class only met for a couple hours a day and it was full of field trips to beautiful museums and tasty restaurants, hence why it’s at the top of the A tier. You can read more about my experience in Madrid  here archive Instagram I’ve also written about this class before, but to summarize, comic book writing is so different from film and prose due to the fact that it’s just still images.  You can read more about my experiences in this class here here This class is extremely cool because it literally embodies what I’ve been looking for during my time at MIT. I will also do a blogpost on this class so I won’t go too much into it, but essentially this class looks at computer science tools and teaches you how to apply them sensibly and meaningfully to humanities research. We learned how to work with text, looking at techniques like sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, and topic modeling, then images and looking at machine learning, color extraction, kernels and filters, and also at audio and datasets. Coding is honestly so very cool when I get to use it in contexts that are actually relevant and interesting to me. I’ve also written about this class already! One of my favorite CS classes and one of the best taught CS classes at MIT! Super clear and understandable, engaging lectures, well-taught recitations, reasonable-length and difficulty psets/labs, fairly graded quizzes. A class that I think should be taken after 6.0001 (Intro Python) and before 6.009 (Fundamentals of Programming). They’re trying to get rid of this class and I think that’s stupid because this class is fantastic. I believe this so much so that I wrote a letter called “Do not remove 6.034 from EECS requisites” and in it I write: 6.034 was the class that affirmed my place in computer science. As a 21E major, I am only concentrating in computer science, but I found my time and my work in 6.034 valuable, useful, and, above all, encouraging. MIT computer science classes in the past were cruel and grueling and, honestly, disheartening. I found myself wanting to quit the major over and over again because it equated punishment and suffering with learning. Classes like 6.006 and 6.009 rewarded past experience and punished new students by moving the class at such a pace that was so difficult to catch up with. I had many of my peers drop these classes for mental health reasons, the class nearly driving some of them to suicide. 6.034 is truly a one of a kind MIT computer science class. This is the  one of the only computer science classes positive cared about me.  Now read that again. How is it that I have taken 6 computer science classes and only two of them were  kind  I need 6.034 to stay in the curriculum because it teaches legitimate computer science work and fields, and does so in a  good, effective manner.  doable. This class is necessary to  keep computer science  Had I not take 6.034, I honestly would have quit computer science. But 6.034 convinced me that I could pick up computer science concepts when it was taught at an actual  normal I do not think 6.034 is “lesser than” any other intro class at MIT — it is simply more  realistic.  Great class that essentially gave me an excuse to practice video editing and filming and I genuinely got a lot more comfortable in Adobe Premiere through the class.  I’ve written about it here T.L. is a fantastic professor.  This class was great and I talk about it a little bit here Literally the nicest teaching staff EVER. I also love biology and thought I was going to be a bioengineering major at MIT so it was really refreshing being able to take a STEM class at MIT that I was actually   at. This class also made me consider being course 7 again before I realized it’s probably too late to do that (but honestly I wish I added some variation of 7 in there). This class was my first ever lecture of my college career. I love chemistry a lot so this class was really easy and fun for me and lectures were so engaging, Grossman is a fantastic prof. Previous 9.00 blogpost here. Previous 6.08 blogpost here. Also written about here. Love Ed! Only really took this class because it was a requirement. Got to do really interesting debates about media, but nothing super duper special. Ok, I actually don’t know why this is lower than the other two, this should probably be above CMS.300 and CMS.701. I loved this class, but mainly because I loved the professor and found him super engaging and his lectures really entertaining. The TAs were all super helpful and it’s one of the few STEM classes I didn’t feel stupid in. Okay class! Nice professor, nice environment, nothing super memorable. Got to watch a lot of movies :) See above. This class was poorly paced and also rough, I actually don’t know why I placed this so high, it should be in Didn’t really like it LOL but it was fun to take cause it was my freshman IAP and I took it with my friends and we suffered together. Great professor who’s really understanding. Psets were kind of long. Lecture were super clear, though. Honestly should be above 6.145. Great professor!!! Dyatlov is super great, he did little dances at the end of each of our lectures. I don’t think I absorbed the info super well, but that’s not the fault of the class, this was just Fall 2020 virtual semester. Poorly taught class in that it was messy and the assignments were hard, but I can’t fault them too much because it was their first time running the class. I learned a lot in this class and I spent so much time in Javascript. OK class. COVID semester class. Readings were interesting, but also didn’t pay a lot of attention. Very kind professor! This was the first humanities class I took at MIT. I didn’t do super well in it and I found it kind of hard. Learned-ish. Just a really fucking hard class. Not horribly taught, I’m just so bad at physics. Nice professor, he comforted me when I was angry about how we had to take a midterm the day we found out we were getting kicked off campus. Hard class, I’m just really bad at discrete math, but that’s ok. This class singlehandedly convinced me to fill out a transfer app to leave MIT. horrible transition from intro python to this class. Literally sobbed about this class every week. Literally dedicated 20-30 hours a week to this class and nothing paid off. I’m sure if I had another semester to get it, I would’ve. But this was the class that taught me that the amount of effort and time you put into a class does not always pay off.

It seems to me that we swath an imaginary future world in pretty words. We want it comfortable, we want it just, we want it innovative, and most of all, we want it beautiful. VC-talk is speckled with grandiose promises:  Everybody agrees that our current world is  , and we need to strive for change, and we aren’t quite sure how that change will ripple outwards into our global systems, but, well—here’s another pretty word! Hopefully it’ll distract you from asking any more difficult questions. I suppose we are all shackled to the linearity of time, hence this preoccupation with the  : the only chunk of our existence that has not yet been determined for us. I used to cling to regret— until I truly thought about it and realized that repeating years of my life with full knowledge of future outcomes would be incredibly tedious. This reverence we give to the future, I don’t think it’s quite deserved. The future is not so different than any other instance of time, except that it has not happened yet, and thus any adjectives may be attached to it. It can be apocalyptic. It can be dazzling. It can be destructive, or it can be beautiful. This attitude reminds me of the conservative attitude towards fetuses. Because it has not demanded anything from us, we can imagine it to be anything we want—how convenient! I’ve found myself seduced by this easy illusion.  . There’s nothing wrong with these platitudes about the future, except that they allow for laziness through vagueness. There is some importance in reflecting upon and understanding which values to prioritize—certainly that is better than wandering in the dark without any well-defined values at all—but values need to be achieved through action. It is good to know where the moon is, but you’ll never get there without building the rocket ship. I’m probably too young to be giving any definitive advice on  , so I’ll end this post by discussing the future I imagine for myself and how I want to get there. Sometimes, younger students—especially those who want to finish college in less than four years—ask me why I’ve been around MIT for so long. My answer is always because I love learning, and I love taking classes, and I love being in this inspiring, intellectual environment. I’m sticking around next year for a master’s degree. This choice has undeniable opportunity costs—I could earn much more working in industry—but actions reflect values. Seizing the future I actually want—instead of the one that will be inflicted upon me—means being okay with having less money or status than my peers. Yesterday, my friend told me that he thought I was unusual for an MIT student.  . Revealed preferences—perhaps I’ve always liked doing what is interesting in the moment, instead of working towards some aspirational future. Except that isn’t quite correct. In choosing to take a year off to work in New Zealand instead of grinding away on problem sets in college, I chose a future where I would be someone with New-Zealand-gap-year experiences instead of sophomore-year-at-MIT experiences. There is no such thing as  ; this is already my life. Is my future meaningfully distinguishable from the choices I have already made, the person I already am? Maybe I don’t need to worry about the future so much—the train will always come. here

I am finished with my undergraduate career. I officially stop being a student blogger on… *checks watch* May 31. So, I think it’s time we talked about things and I fill you in! But for now, enjoy these photos of me throughout the semester. Previous Next The goal for the time left is to spend as much time as possible with people before I embark on a new adventure :)

the title and subtitle come from my  favorite scene  of  bojack horseman some of my friends prefer the  alternate saying “it never gets easier, you just get stronger” . i think these sayings are communicating the same thing and don’t believe the distinction is important, but pick whichever phrasing you like more i suppose during the summer, fall, and winter of 2020 i refused to clean my mouth. i never brushed my teeth or flossed or rinsed or used mouthwash, and no dentist ever yelled at me because we were in lockdown so i never saw any dentists. my gums became weaker and weaker, my breath began smelling worse and worse, and i noticed these things and merely accepted them. back then i’d told myself that you had to brush and floss every day for the rest of your life to have good oral hygiene, and there was no way i was going to maintain such a long streak when just doing so for a single day was excruciatingly boring, so i might as well give up now, right? during the fall and winter of 2020, i couldn’t work for more than a few minutes at a time without getting distracted and needing to walk around or check social media. part of it was general boredom with virtual classes, part of it was me not having a clear idea of what i wanted to learn or focus on, and part of it was me thinking everyone around me was so much more capable than me that i lost motivation to work. i only survived that semester because three of my classes contained intro-level content i was familiar with, the fourth (film music) consisted of watching movies and listening to soundtracks, and the fifth (organic chemistry) was being graded on pass-fail with massive curves. when i took a break from school that spring to do an internship, i told people it was a cost-cutting move and that i didn’t like remote school and wanted to get more work experience, and those things were true, but i also did it because i thought i couldn’t handle a full courseload during the fall and winter of 2020, and the spring of 2021, i didn’t exercise for nine months straight. back when i was at home i would go on runs every two or three days, but during those nine months i moved around a lot and there were no parental figures to hold me accountable so i didn’t bother. when i did attempt to run, every step felt like i was smashing my foot into the ground, and the path ahead seemed endless, and i’d think about how i would have to smash my foot into the ground a thousand times more before the end of the run, and then i’d decide to spare myself from all that unnecessary pain and quit maybe all these issues were symptoms of bigger problems. maybe i was depressed, or maybe it was just adult growing pains, or maybe it was the pandemic playing tricks on my mind, or maybe it was all of these things and more. whatever it was, it left me lethargic, with a complete inability to perform any form of self-care or self-maintenance, and i didn’t even realize this was a problem because i didn’t yet understand these things were important while on break from school i moved to sf and got my first close-up glimpse of silicon valley culture. i’d already known beforehand that tech founders were obsessed with speed and moving quickly, but it was only after meeting more people in person that i realized the obsession with speed often bled over into seeking out quick fixes to problems: productivity hacks to help with focus, self-help tips for becoming a better person, experimentation with meditation and substances to resolve internal conflicts, an endless array of  b2b  products that claim to solve any problem a business might be struggling with i imagine some of these suggestions have actually been quite valuable and have helped many people resolve their issues – for instance, i have sometimes found a self-help book to be  useful  and have occasionally stumbled upon products that  address  their intended use cases painlessly and quickly. but my experience is that most problems are not so simple to resolve and most solutions do not work nearly as easily as they are advertised to: i personally have never found a productivity hack more effective than old-fashioned planning and scheduling, a lot of b2b software is painful to use and requires hiring dedicated personnel to interact with, my friends who arrive at epiphanies while meditating still struggle with implementing those epiphanies and grappling with their consequences afterwards, and so on in short, immersing myself in tech culture didn’t solve any of my problems, even though various people promised it would and i desperately wanted to believe them in my  favorite basketball interview  of all time, a reporter (R) asks michael beasley (B) how successful his team will be this season and how far they’ll go in the playoffs. some context: it’s september, the season hasn’t started yet, and playoffs happen between april and june at the end of the season. beasley knows that he’s a role player on a new team and that a lot can happen over the course of the season, so he refuses to answer the question and instead tells the reporter that the team’s goal is to work as hard as possible, one day at a time R : With taking it a day at a time, where should this Lakers team end up by the end of the year? B : Exactly where we want to be. R : Which is? Where do you want to be? B : Taking it a day at a time. R : But once you add up all those days, where can you end up? B : The future. R : Fair, if you’re going to move the calendar there, but in the future, let’s say April through June, April through May, where should the ceiling be for this group? B : Ceiling? I don’t know. I’m not sure. That’s not up to me… Like I said, we’re here to do one job which is work, sacrifice and take it a day at a time. at first glance it seems like beasley is deliberately trolling the reporter. take a closer look though, and you realize that beasley has given one of the most realistic answers possible to the reporter’s implied question of  will this team win a championship? here are some of the not-so-quick fixes that helped me become a more functional human being: watching that  bojack  clip every day for months in a row. doing more activities with other people, instead of trying to do everything alone. taking things a day at a time, or an hour at a time, or a minute at a time when i started brushing my teeth again after not doing so for almost a year, it was as boring and uncomfortable as i’d remembered it being.  but you gotta do it every day, that’s the hard part , i reminded myself – brushing my teeth would always require effort in the moment, while i was in the act of brushing. but the good news with taking things a day at a time was that i no longer had to worry about maintaining a long streak or about brushing my teeth every day for the rest of my life; i just had to focus on brushing for the day i was currently in, and as long as i did so things would naturally get easier over time when i trained myself to study and focus and read again, i took the same approach on the timescale of hours instead of days. i used the  pomodoro technique , where you divide your time into half-hour blocks and alternate between spending 25 minutes working on a single task without distractions and 5 minutes taking a break. the philosophy behind pomodoros is to forget about all your texts and emails and other obligations and to make the next 25 minutes your entire life – it doesn’t matter how strong the urge is to open emails or look at your phone or get up and take a walk, you only have to resist that urge for a few more minutes and survive until the end of the block, and afterwards you can cave in and do all the other things you wanted to do. and this is helpful because 25 minute blocks are much less intimidating and therefore much easier to commit to than multi-hour work sessions, even if you’re stacking your blocks into a multi-hour session anyway when i started running again, i divided my runs into individual minutes. i’d start at a walking pace, and then every minute i’d bump my pace up by half a mile per hour until i was having trouble keeping up, and then every subsequent minute i’d decrease my pace by half a mile per hour. doing so allowed me to try out faster paces without immediately giving up (because i could tell myself that i only had to maintain the pace for a minute, after which i could decide whether to keep it or slow back down), and imposing that structure helped me run for longer without quitting none of the techniques i’ve described here are really cures or solutions. taking things a step at a time does not change what is possible or unlock new skills; it merely shifts your attention to focus better on the present, and it’s nowhere near foolproof at that either. i still have days where i feel especially unmotivated and decide to go to bed without brushing my teeth; i still have hours where i become unusually antsy and switch tabs even though i said i was in the middle of a pomodoro; i still have minutes where my legs suddenly begin feeling like a pile of bricks and then i decide to end my run prematurely. i have never found a way to prevent these kinds of relapses, only ways to try and reduce their frequency over time until eventually on most days i can stop thinking as consciously about fighting the relapse and can instead carry myself through sheer force of habit these days a lot of my attention goes towards another set of problems – i struggle with  anxiety  and don’t have the healthiest relationship with food and still don’t focus as well as i’d like to. i am still looking for the right frameworks to give myself for these problems, and once i’ve found them i will try to apply them a day at a time and a meal at a time and an hour at a time, and surely it will take a while and surely there will be relapses but hopefully it will also get easier over time there are no miracles, no shortcut buttons to fast-forward to the end of the process, no magic spells to suddenly make everything right. and i think this is a good thing – i believe life would be unendurable if all our problems could be solved quickly, because that would imply that all our flaws are our fault, that they should’ve all been resolved already and the only reason they haven’t is because we did something wrong, and the intolerance for error would be unbearable. i think it is good that these things take time and have no end on an only tangentially related note, here’s another take on flossing that i found in a vlogbrothers  video  and appreciated: “I advise you to floss. I know it is hard and annoying and kind of unpleasant, but I am a big fan of flossing not only for dental health but also because it is a wondrous act of faith. Flossing is a way of current you saying, ‘I believe that there will be a me in the future, and that this me will be older and more frail than the current me, with less healthy teeth and gums, and I floss today not for current me but for that future me.’ It’s kind of a beautiful thing. Same with sunscreen, by the way.”

This morning, I was Googling Chris to find a photo of him, and was inadvertently reminded, thanks to news reports, that he was once a child prodigy who represented the United States at the International Chemistry Olympiad the summer after ninth grade. It’s easy to forget how smart he is—we’ve known each other forever, and he is my best friend, and when we talk, I don’t feel out of my depth. Chris is starting his PhD in the fall, making him the latest among my exes to pursue a STEM doctorate degree. My two high school boyfriends are both currently in PhD programs (pure math and chemical engineering); when we were teenagers, I obviously hadn’t given any thought to their plans regarding higher education, and had chosen to date them because we had a decent rapport and shared interests. “Why are you always dating these PhD types? You’re overindexing on intelligence. Why don’t you go for someone like ‘James’,” my brother Kyler once told me. “James is ambitious, accomplished. He’s self-made.” But I’ve never been romantically drawn to that kind of person—the Forbes 30 Under 30 type, the industry leader, the high achiever. Someone preoccupied with status, who wears success like luxury cologne. I didn’t say this to Kyler at the time, but it isn’t intelligence I’m looking for. It’s curiosity. When I ask Chris how he got into chemistry, he tells me about how, at age six, he really liked this chemistry book—an introductory college textbook—and read it cover-to-cover. In seventh grade, he begged and begged his parents for a lab so he could do his own experiments. He adored the colors and textures. “It felt like magic,” he told me on one of our first dates. It’s a story that diverges wildly from the backstories of other Olympiad kids I’ve known. My other friends almost always have a story that involves helicopter parents, prep classes starting in second grade, a childhood curated for success. And Chris had all of that, too—he had to play violin, he had to do worksheets in preschool while all the other kids played—but he also had an unrelenting love for chemistry. Back when Chris and I were dating, his friend called us a “power couple.” It was a well-meaning compliment, but it made us both cringe, because it felt so far removed from reality. It felt like Chris and I were kids who had been obsessive about our interests, and then we’d gotten good enough at those interests to be rewarded with some extrinsic markers of success, but we certainly weren’t trying to appear on magazine covers or increase the number of commas in our bank accounts. Over-optimized lives—cold showers, early-morning jogs, 500+ connections on LinkedIn—disinterest me. A life built to be seen by others—that’s not what I want. My friends often say I can’t help but be myself. “You wear your heart on your sleeve,” they say. It’s true, I find it suffocating to cosplay anybody or anything else. I want to spend my time chasing whatever whims I have. I refuse to stifle my obsessions in pursuit of somebody else’s idea of excellence. And that’s what I find so compelling in other people, too. Reckless curiosity, childlike wonder, a neglected resumé. Intelligence matters, success matters, but perhaps those things arrive later, and perhaps those qualities are not so rare among people I know. But the inner confidence to commit to a passion—that is special. here

Passing Through (Can’t the Future Just Wait) In high school, when I’d start to get bored of a class, I’d sit and stare at the clock, and I’d count down the time left in the class period by intervals. “It’s 10:30, so that’s three 10 minute intervals before math class, or six 5 minute intervals. It’s fifteen minutes til we are halfway there.” And I’d repeat this throughout the class. It became almost a game. “Ah look it’s 10:45, now 7.5 minutes til we are halfway there from where we are now. And you just made it 15 minutes, how bad can 7.5 be?” So on and so forth. I feel like I’m doing that with my time here at MIT too. Almost a year ago, I wrote a blogpost about how I was  halfway Oh my god time is going faster. I think this is to some extent what people mean when they say time is flying. Take for example MIT. When I was a first year, 100% of my experience at MIT was being a first year, and man did it feel slow. Then, I was a sophomore, and that eventually took up 50% of my experience at MIT. Now, ending my junior year, a mere 1/3 of my life at the institute so far has finished. It’s the natural motion of the world. More experience leads to a smaller proportion of the time it took to gain that experience. At least it feels that way. Here let me give another example that might make more sense. When you are one year old, a year is 100% of your life. When you’re 2, a year is 50% of your life. Then 33%. Then 25%. Until suddenly you’re 50 and a year is 2% of your life. You just start experiencing life faster and faster. (This  website Now, of course, there are milestones that break up your life into smaller chunks, almost “resetting” your clock. For me, one of those milestones was becoming a blogger. For me, this past year was 100% of my MIT blogging life. Which is wild to me, conceptually. On the one hand, because I’ve been blogging slightly longer than that, but moreso because there are people graduating this year for whome one year is 25%/33%/50% of their MIT blogging life. And damn, am I going to miss them. As their final blogs roll out (if they haven’t already), I implore you to read them. Take them in. Realize time is going by too quickly.  And let time pass though #halfway #paige being existential

Today was the last day of classes for the spring semester—and, as a senior, the last day of classes for my undergraduate career. So, after my very last class, a seminar-style class on modern drama, I texted

By my count, there are 61 times I’ve referenced a song in one of my posts. I made a Spotify playlist if you want to listen to them all: I’ve had to make some substitutions to some songs not on Spotify. fun. How phonology explains wordplay in Tagalog songs we visited every station on the MBTA list of things that refill my will to live Lies in MIT, lies about MIT unsubscribe Colorful . My first post, and it’s one of the dozen or so posts I have that are structured around a song. I think I stole the format of taking song lyrics and placing them as section epigraphs from the days of Wattpad fanfiction, and despite never being a fanfic author myself, it stuck with me. Downtown . I’m surprised this is the only Coldplay song I’ve referenced. The Scientist is one of my top ten favorite songs, and A Sky Full of Stars, Yellow and Everglow also form part of my favorites. Then again, I’m not sure what I would’ve written around The Scientist. Little things . No Snow isn’t even in my top three Reese Lansangan songs, but it’s suitable for a lot of holiday season happenings. ⁠ 01 This means "originally performed by", which I’ve seen a lot in a capella concert programs over here. on friends / minsan . I’ve heard four recordings of Minsan. There’s the Eraserheads original, which is a good recording, but not my favorite. Eraserheads tribute album The Reunion has a cover from Callalily, which is pretty faithful to the original. The musical Ang Huling El Bimbo had a version I had the pleasure of listening to live, which is wonderful in context. But Munimuni’s cover adds a melancholy that matches what I feel about the song. had i known how to save a life . I listened to this song so much in high school that I know it verbatim. We made a website . This is a subtle mention, but enough that I included it. It’s Tóng Huà in pinyin, and Fairy Tale in English. It’s also ridiculously popular here. I don’t speak a word of Mandarin, but I can sing along to the chorus. fun.  At the time I called these my favorite fun. songs. I don’t think that’s true anymore; I’d put Barlights, The Gambler, Why Am I the One, Stars, and All Alright above these. Though maybe I’d put At Least I’m Not As Sad (As I Used to Be) higher up. Anyway, the point is I love fun., and while I’m sad they’re on hiatus, the later works of Nate Ruess and Jack Antonoff are cool too. soulsearching / naubos na . I was struck that the music video was released at the same time I had the beginning of my career crisis. Oh, Flamingo! is the only artist in this list I’ve seen live not once, but twice, and I love them so much. If I had the time, I might’ve written about Pag-Ibig Lang Ba or Anino. If Pagtanda was out at the time I wrote  How phonology explains wordplay in Tagalog songs  “to get older” and   “remembrance”. Back to back to back . Another quick mention. Ang Huling El Bimbo is one of those ridiculously popular songs nationwide, owing to the lasting influence of the Eraserheads on Filipino music. It’s their most popular song, one I’m comfortable enough singing for a crowd, because I can bet someone will sing along. It’s my karaoke go-to. Your first last day . For The Fickle is a song I strongly associate with goodbyes. The song isn’t primarily about that; it’s about a relationship on the ropes. But the line “All my life has been about / Waiting for people to go” hits so hard. It’s also the saddest-sounding song on this list. next to normal . I’m not a huge musical person, but I got recommended the song and I still think of it from time to time about my depression. uncertainly . Sometimes I throw a song into a post for the sake of making a post, you know? Uncertainly, like For The Fickle, is another song I associate with goodbyes, and being sad. at least i’m not as sad as i used to be . This is the second mention of At Least I’m Not As Sad (As I Used to Be), and it gets a dedicated post this time. Someone sent me an email about this post once, saying they cried after reading it. I still read it from time to time. non-stop / walang hinto . I was in an Ang Bandang Shirley phase when I first listened to Alam Mo Ba? (Ang Gulo). Other songs I like are Nakauwi Na, Di Na Babalik, and Umaapaw. And Maginhawa, the song that lent itself to my first post. in remembrance of the body . Another cover. I first heard it used in an episode of TV series Dark. The dynamics in this one are great, and remind me of Somebody That I Used to Know. present tense . Like Coldplay, The Ransom Collective is another band that I love but haven’t used in my writing as much. Probably because most of their songs have this adventurous tone. Present Tense is one of the exceptions, along with Something Better, which I’ve been meaning to write a post about for a while now. Ridiculous things I’ve been up to . This is a subtle mention, but my laptop is named after Rusty Machines so I felt the need to link to one of their songs. Every song on their EP City Lights is great, so I picked Forget You. The other contender was Can’t Hardly Wait. Twenty thousand paper cuts . This isn’t mentioned or linked in the body of the post at all, but it was definitely the song I was thinking of while I was writing this post. I didn’t include it because the tone felt too cheerful, but the lyrics are good. it’s thanksgiving or something . I love this song because of the music video. Enough said. we visited every station on the MBTA . This was my joint post with Alan Z. ’23. We mentioned these songs in the body of the post. They fall in this weird category of “technically mentioned in one of my posts, but not relevant,” which we’ll only see more of later. Celeste  The only song on this list without lyrics. I play lots of video games, but none have been noteworthy enough to get their music mentioned or linked, except Celeste. That’s how much I love the music. where is home?  Why is this song titled Milk? Who knows. The album it’s in, houseplants, is the one album of a song in this list that I will listen to without skipping. The other Cheats album, Before the Babies, is also something I’ll listen to without skipping. Their first album, though, I’d skip maybe half the songs. But the rest of their songs are bangers. Two hundred puzzles, fifty weeks later . Did you know that to hunt with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ you need to know the lyrics of Rock Lobster by heart? This is a fact I made up, but it’s funny so I’ll keep saying it. whiteout conditions . I learned of The New Pornographers through Vincent H. ’23, who got me to listen to Adventures in Solitude back in late 2020. I love The New Pornographers because of how upfront A. C. Newman is about his depression, and you can hear it in Whiteout Conditions and Adventures in Solitude. list of things that refill my will to live . I’m not sure whether I first learned of Sleeping At Last through Jason C. ’22 or Jeffery Y. ’22, but I’m glad I got introduced to it. Strangely enough, my favorite songs from Sleeping At Last are from the album Covers, Vol. 2, like the cover of Chasing Cars or Make You Feel My Love. demons . This song isn’t referred to directly in the post, but it was on loop the whole time I worked on it. Demons is my favorite song, period. I wish I could hit the high notes. It’s not even that deep; the message of acknowledging and battling your insecurities is almost spelled out in the lyrics, and is an idea that’s in lots of other songs. But the comparison to demons is especially meaningful to me because of my upbringing. eternal dissatisfaction . This is a song from Rhythm Doctor, a game I picked up again two weeks ago. It’s the first song on the list I couldn’t find on Spotify, so I replaced it with another song from Rhythm Doctor, Invisible. It’s my favorite song on Rhythm Doctor, and I’m sure every creative has shared the struggle of wanting to produce more work. Rain by any other name . Now that I’m reading the post again, I realize that I also mention Aegis – Basang-Basa sa Ulan in this post, and even quote some lyrics. Oops. I’m too lazy to update the playlist or the stats. If you see any other songs I miss you should let me know lmao. everything is actually going okay . I love this song because it’s so blunt. The lyrics “I miss having sex but at least I don’t wanna die / Anymore, and I think that’s pretty cool” leave no room for misinterpretation. I hear the song got viral on TikTok a few years ago? No Snow, and on singing badly . This is an embarrassing post. I think that’s the point. Two hundred puzzles, fifty people later . There’s a video, buried somewhere in this post, of me doing a lipsync to this song. It’s only mildly less embarrassing than my cover. dear kuya . I made the subtitle “i promise this post is mostly in english” but then I put the post in the category “Blogs That Aren’t in English”. Haha, I’m so funny. I always wish I could write more posts in that category, but the inspiration was hard to come by. Dear Kuya’s a song I was sitting on for a while before I wrote the post, which was triggered by events that were happening at the time. Lies in MIT, lies about MIT . The song isn’t super related to the post at all lol. I mean, they’re both about lies, and that’s it. It’s a good song though. unsubscribe . Subtle reference, because it only appears as a link to a YouTube video in the beginning. You should read  here i go again Becoming a better programmer . Another song that isn’t too related to the post, but I like the song so I shoehorned it in. This falls in the category of Nate Ruess and Jack Antonoff post-fun. songs that I like, which includes Rollercoaster and Harsh Light. senioritis . As much as I wanted to use  We Got Work To Do How phonology explains wordplay in Tagalog songs . To be honest, part of the motivation for that post was so I could up my count of “songs I’ve mentioned in posts I’ve written”. beautiful moments . all the kids are depressed is indirectly referenced by the subtitle; I was thinking of the line “I think too much, we drink too much / Falling in love like it’s just nothing” when I wrote that. One of my favorite moments working for  6.390 Introduction to Machine Learning ice skating . It’s funny. everyone i know goes away in the end . Like My Body Is a Cage, I first heard this song from a TV show, Person of Interest. “Everyone I know / Goes away in the end” has the same vibes as “All my life has been about / Waiting for people to go”, but I was like, wait, I already wrote a post about that song. CMU / Parallel Universe . As explained in  17 Ridiculously Useful Tips Every Blogger Should Know Happy Homestuck Day!  Subtle reference, hidden behind a link. Also, the link was ninja’d in after I realized I hadn’t linked to a Homestuck fandom song, which is an important part of Homestuck. Trust me. Couldn’t find the song on Spotify, so I replaced it with another important Homestuck fandom song, Karkalicious. Homestuck is strange because it’s one of those works that’s differently understood in the context of the fandom. Recommended, but not recommended, I dunno. Circles, circles, circles . Passing mention, but this is the third time I mentioned this song, and thus the song I’ve referred to the most through my blog posts. branches . I’ve been sitting on this post for so long that graduation crept up on me, and I realized that if I wasn’t going to post it soon, I’ll never post it. It’s the same as this post, where I’m realizing how fast I need to finish all my drafts if I want to post them before I graduate. Dear gods, be gentle with me.

I often receive requests for advice about the college process. It makes sense, given my role. About two years ago, I responded to one such inquiry with the following: read this blog entry that I wrote a number of years ago sharing some parental advice https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/summer/ In the intervening period, I received several updates, expressing appreciation for the advice, and the positive developments attributed to “getting out of the way,” including: a significantly improved relationship and outstanding college options. Every situation is different, and the example provided is just that, one single, specific instance. So give them a chance.  They might surprise you.

i already feel like an alum visiting mit, when i come to meetings, when i eat dinners with people, when i go to square dancing every week. it doesn’t feel painful, but maybe it’s because i’m already done. it’s disturbing to me how painless it feels to be saying goodbye. two games i have been thinking about. one,  the witness everything ben&ben has a song called  branches birds music video i’m not a fan of psychological horror games like  ddlc omori the talos principle nier automata outer wilds the stanley parable the beginner’s guide i’m working on my first large code project in a while with a few other people, and already we’ve spawned many branches of our repository. the idea of a branch is that you can develop it on its own but eventually branches get merged into a main branch. progress ever trots forward. there’s been this saga on the random hall mailing list about bowls being “stolen” between floors. one reply says “images can theoretically be faked but the lack of bowls is tangible and real.” a bowl is a bowl is a bowl. in the song branches, the chorus isn’t directed to the listener, but to the singer themselves, as a reassurance that things will be okay even if the listener has left. but this feels at odds: isn’t the singer the one who’s the fire, and the listener the one who needs to be warmed? isn’t the singer the river, who will flow eternally, even without the birds that drink from it? so why does the singer have to reassure themselves, when it should be the listener who will be more hurt by leaving? the future versions of lives i can live will not merge into a single, uber-version of myself that includes all possible good things in all my futures. i can see so many of them, blooming in different directions, branching out. but the best i can hope for is taking all the lessons from my past, my single-threaded, only-one-possible past. the best i can hope for is to work so that as many of my future branches as possible are worlds i will be happy living in, and i can maneuver so to make this possible. i will graduate and become a software engineer, a frontend developer for the same place i worked at last summer, for they offered me a return offer and i accepted it. i asked to work in the new york office, for i  didn’t like the bay area in the same way that as humans we can feel alienated from the rest of the universe, surrounded by our own skin as people living in it, i can exist in mit and yet feel alienated from it. interconnectedness cannot exist without bleak existential thoughts. perhaps the singer needs the listener as much as the other way around. perhaps the fire needs the person to warm, else it is meaningless. perhaps the river needs thirst to quench, else it is meaningless. everything is interconnected, after all. yet, the chorus of birds: “i know that ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh / birds fly in different directions.” a game i have been playing recently is  slay the spire singing bowls the other day i went to the mit awards ceremony and accepted the  compton prize in the million million possible worlds of classes and extracurriculars i could’ve mixed and matched, in some of them i am happy, i am finding joy and love taking the things i want to take. different people do different things for fun. last semester i took a class where we wrote compilers, and to compile a program you must analyze its control flow to some extent. you must think about how its branches can flow and loop and lead into other branches. i liked that class, i did not like it as much as i could’ve, i found more joy doing other things, and we all can do the things that makes us happiest. it is not inherently bad to be privileged, it is what you make of it. and yet, do i want to advance the narrative that an mit graduate   use their education to make the world as best as they possibly could? i want to be able to say, it is okay if you  only save one person i have thought about the fig tree quote from sylvia plath’s the bell jar too many times. i have  quoted it before I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. “meaningless! meaningless!” says the teacher. “utterly meaningless! everything is meaningless.” the prechorus to birds echoes this, “everything is temporary / everything will slide.” ecclesiastes opens with existential questions, and answers that the point is to enjoy life, for these are the gifts of god. like the witness or everything, it is unclear to me whether ecclesiastes is something meant to reduce my existential dread or increase it. the shape of the compton prize is a bowl. a plain, unadorned metal bowl. after the awards ceremony i filled it with the candied nuts they had at the reception. it’s a trophy. it’s sacrilege? it’s merely a bowl. a shiny bowl, but merely a bowl. and a bowl is a bowl is a bowl. will i do good, in the company i will work for? will i contribute to the world? am i making good use of the education given to me, could i be doing better? but part of the  maintenance mindset in branches, before the chorus, the singer asks: “oh love / was it easy to let go?”

Recently, I’ve been trying to record music. I have a mic setup thanks to the rap class I’m taking this semester with Lupe Fiasco; my living group has a piano keyboard, and I’ve downloaded MuseScore. It’s my first time approaching music as a creative outlet, and to be honest, I’m not very good—some of it comes from a lack of experience, but I also suspect I don’t have the voice to ever become better than a mediocre singer. I became interested in songwriting after listening to Olivia Rodrigo’s  album and realizing how wonderfully she captured the pains of first love, first heartbreak, teenage insecurity. Her songs climbed the Billboard Hot 100 because they resonated with so many people, because they bridged the distance between souls in crisply-produced three-minute bundles. sixteen-year-old me needed this album Her music reminded me of what I’ve tried to do for a long time, with my writing, with my fiction, with this blog. Life is less lonely when somebody sees you. Feelings become more manageable when they exist somewhere outside of your own body. Identifying something universal within your own specific experiences—that feels like finding a lighthouse among dark churning waves. In tenth grade, I entered a writing contest for the first time, with a short story I wrote over winter break. It was sarcastic and silly, and I infused it with observations that had plagued me for years, like how I felt trapped between the dichotomy of being a “girly-girl” and a “tomboy”, and how boys got to be multifaceted but girls were labeled one thing or another. It was very, very fun to write. The story ended up winning a national award, and I flew to New York City for the awards ceremony. While there were many wonderful outcomes that arose from this experience—it was the first external, institutional validation I ever received for my writing, and it helped me later in college admissions—I think the most significant internal development was the sudden insight that  . Starting from fourth or fifth grade, I felt like I’d been constricted by gender norms, by internalized misogyny, by other people’s expectations of who I was “supposed” to be—but I’d never really discussed my frustrations with anybody. Then I got to make up a story and give my problems to a fictional character. That was years ago, and my relationship to creative writing has since become more complicated. I’ve been incredibly lucky in many ways—eternal gratitude to those who have believed in me and supported me even when life was rocky—but it was only after the (metaphorical) ink on the contract had dried that I realized being a professional writer is very different from being a hobbyist, from being a kid tapping out fanfiction at midnight. The expectations were stricter, the critics were more vicious, and the stakes were higher. I don’t try to take my writing too seriously, which isn’t always easy. But I’ve found that when I become obsessive about crafting a beautiful phrase or vivid image, that’s often a sign of ego—and it’s necessary sometimes, but it can also get in the way of the reasons I began writing in the first place. What if I want to be terrible and artless? What if I want to draw ridiculous comics featuring characters with unrealistic proportions and sloppy storylines? What if I want to record a pop melody that bashes a thinly-disguised ex and upload it to Soundcloud only to get two likes? I don’t want to commodify everything, and I don’t want to be good at everything. I don’t want to think about the invisible audience hovering behind my shoulder, casting a critical gaze upon anything I produce. My songs may never be heard by anybody other than myself—I don’t know if I should inflict my singing upon others. I don’t know if I have anything innovative to contribute, and I don’t know if I want people to scrutinize my music. Last week, as I wrote lyrics, the thought floated through me— —but I wanted to capture what I was feeling in that moment before it faded. I wanted to preserve that version of Rona before she was lost to the merciless linearity of time. It felt like a song was the most honest conduit for her, and it didn’t matter if it was terrible. here

It’s finally here – the grand finale of the Fredventure! Read  part 1  and  part 2  to get up to speed if you haven’t already. We spent most of days 7 and 8 rehearsing/performing our music, so half of this blog post will be my general thoughts about being in MITWE. Day 7 It was the day before the big concert; naturally, the entire afternoon was blocked out for a dress rehearsal. Still, we had one more excursion at the Cultural Centre of the Peoples of the Amazon before then. At the Cultural Center, we met Djuena Tikuna (the indigenous singer who was to perform with us) and her husband in person for the first time. Our cast of performers was finally complete! Djuena then taught us the lyrics to a song in the  Ticuna language  about saving the rainforest; we would perform an arrangement of that song in our concert the next day! While we sang with Djuena I felt like a celebrity when I saw this poster outside the Teatro Amazonas. We spent the rest of the day rehearsing in the Teatro Amazonas. Unfortunately, we ran over time so often that we ended up behind schedule by about an hour. The rehearsal stretched on for so long that we didn’t get to rehearse one of our pieces. Fred was visibly distressed (which also made us sad), so a few MITWE members tried to get Ken Amis (our assistant conductor who wasn’t on the trip with us) on the phone to help calm Fred’s nerves. Fred picture of the day. Day 8 Finally, the big day arrived. I could feel the excitement bubbling in the air as I lined up in the hotel lobby to receive a Brazilian tattoo… temporary, of course, and sanctioned by
 
MIT ⁠ 01 Well, mostly just Fred, but what’s the difference? genipapo  – a dark blue dye also used to colour food, like edible henna. (I forgot to mention this in the previous blog post, but Fred had also decided two days prior that we should perform in the
 
black t-shirts ⁠ 02 The t-shirts had the same design as the poster above. I thought they looked really groovy. A slice of genipapo toast. (And no, this was not the slice that made me almost miss a piece during the concert.) Despite the previous day’s technical difficulties, the concert was an overwhelming success! We even managed to set up an impromptu live stream of the event on someone’s phone, which you can watch  on MITWE’s Facebook page . (However, I did  almost  miss one of the pieces I was performing in because I was too engrossed in eating a slice of genipapo toast in the dressing room to notice everyone leaving to go on stage. But Fred doesn’t need to know that 😉.) Afterwards, there were even fireworks outside; I know they’re almost certainly unrelated to our concert, but I like to think they were for us anyway. Fred picture of the day. And with the concert done and dusted, it was time to head back to Cambridge and continue our MIT lives. What a way to end my spring break! As I ate brunch back at Simmons Hall and thought about how grateful I was for eating vegetables and not fish for the first time in a week, I also thought about how lucky I was to be a part of MIT’s thriving arts scene. When I first came to MIT, I thought I’d have to give up my identity of being a musician in favour of becoming the stereotypical MIT engineer, with all work and no play. But then I discovered MITWE, and there was music in my life once more. Through MITWE, I can play music from around the world in a large ensemble, allowing me to continue honing my clarinet skills and developing my musicality. And I even get six units of
 
HASS-A ⁠ 03 The arts component of MIT's humanities requirement an iPad Pro  on top of that! Of course, most MITWE musicians are not there just for academic credit (although it is a very nice bonus); instead, most people are there because they’re passionate about music and sharing their passion with others. When Fred asked us out of the blue to spend a day performing in a concert hall an hour away from MIT, a dozen of us chose to go with him even though we could’ve easily stayed home and worked on psets instead. Because of this amazing community, some alumni continue playing in the ensemble for years after graduating. (Scott, MITWE’s historian, has been involved for over 20 years!) But the glue that holds this all together is undeniably Fred Harris, our wonderful conductor. Although I’ve only been at MIT for two years and haven’t witnessed his true power, several senior faculty members have described him and his projects, such as  the time he brought Jacob Collier to MIT , as pure genius to me. Not only does he work tirelessly to ensure everything runs smoothly, but he’s also genuinely invested in every MITWE member’s well-being, with our semesterly “playing exam” doubling as an opportunity for him to check on how we’re doing during the most stressful time of the semester. To any incoming first-year student who plays percussion/a wind instrument and wants to be a part of this once-in-a-lifetime experience at MIT, I highly recommend auditioning for MITWE. It has been one of the most defining parts of my MIT journey thus far (and I’m sure Fred would appreciate having bassoons after not having any this year). #Brazil #Course 21M - Music and Theatre Arts #MITWE

I’ve learned many things after coming to MIT. But among the differential equations and op amp PSETs, I’ve learned how to take care of myself, interact with others, how to be independent, and how to lean on others or ask for help when necessary. I’ve also learned a lot about my past, that my high school was competitive to the point of being toxic, and that it’s important to pick the people that you hang around with wisely ( I have now acquired standards for friends). But what hit me the hardest was I realized I hadn’t truly lived until I came to college. So what’s the difference between living and surviving? PLAY. Living’s supposed to be fun. Not to say grade school wasn’t fun, but I felt like I was treading water. I had three square meals a day, friends to hang out with at lunchtime, and a goal to work towards (college), but I didn’t feel like I was going anywhere. I remember sometimes pausing in the middle of doing homework and thinking “what am I doing with my life?” It sounds ironic, because everything almost felt too purposeful. Most of the art I made was to make a portfolio, the volunteering was because I wanted to help people, and although they were fun, there was nearly nothing I was doing “just because.” The fondest moments I remember were the little things, like doodling on sticky notes when class got too confusing, pelting my friends with ketchup packets, and wandering the city on my bike with no direction in mind. Everyone I’ve met at MIT has an attitude of “just do it”. they say, reaching for yet another tangerine. And gradually, instead of adding purpose to play, I started adding fun to responsibility. I’ve turned in most of my math PSETs with sketches on the margins, and lectures started sounding really interesting with good professors and a puzzle-like approach. Math had always been the bane of my existence, and not being able to understand the problems in recitation still kills me a little inside, but differential equations and voltage dividers have been strangely interesting. Sbleeb’s (Professor Steven B Leeb’s) “guzz-in” and “guzz-out” water faucet analogy for a transistor made equation derivations incredibly clear. The occasional “ya dig?” and “do you guys follow me?” to check for confusion as well as the “rippin’ bags of current” and “buffer bois” only make his classes all the more engaging. a screenshot of my math scratch doodles Small personal projects also lend themselves to a lot of learning. After building a man-eating couch for Make MIT, I got really good at using joysticks and servo motors. I learned how to use KiCAD (pcb design software) after milling a tiny led fidget toy. And making a whole bunch of fused glass art taught me how to use the kiln in the Edgerton 4-409 makerspace. When progress feels slow, it’s always easy to think that the me in high school could have cruised through my workload, but it’s also easy to forget that I’m now doing things that high school me couldn’t ever imagine. If I had a conversation with her about the stuff I’m learning, she probably wouldn’t understand half the words I was saying. Previous Next I have a horribly inconsistent and nocturnal sleep schedule, forget to drink water, lose an average of one item per day (that I can’t find until weeks later) and eat whenever when there’s free food or decide that feeding myself is worth the time not doing something else, but it feels like an adventure trying to keep myself alive. I started learning to cook when I had creative freedom. I throw in random things at random amounts and manage to create something that tastes surprisingly better than dining hall food. I have microwaved my attempt at fried chicken multiple times because the inside was still squishy raw after I stir fried it. My ground beef and potato was seasoned with the 7 closest spices I could grab, containing a healthy mixture of American, Asian, and violently Italian flavors. One of my wild attempts at making food gave me a mild allergic reaction— I still have no clue why, but the taste was sure as hell worth it. you can never go wrong with soy sauce. I have no ability to keep a calendar and have to check my class schedule for the day because I haven’t memorized it, and nothing has ever felt repetitive. I keep track of what I’m supposed to do by memorizing only what I need to do tomorrow. I don’t have too much bandwidth to stay stuck in the past, and don’t spend too much time worrying about the future and planning out details that will change when the time comes anyway. It does get a little stressful sometimes. I recognize I occasionally lack vital planning and important reflection to improve, but I find myself enjoying the time I spend in the real world much more than the time I spend in my head. At MIT, there’s even variety in stress. Panicking about a class I need to run, an unfinished group project, a sad friend, an upcoming midterm, ec-discuss drama, and the untouched pset on the due date all feel slightly different. So while I might be stressed, it’s never boring. I like to think of them as different flavors of firehoses to drink from. Some taste like soap and gasoline, some like leaf litter, and some like cat piss, but either way you’re getting a balanced meal. getting hosed I’m get lost often, but there are people with me, also struggling through their mountain of work, and upperclassmen to look to for guidance. It’s been described to me like being parented by upperclassmen. The freshmen here don’t get hazed because everyone understands how rough it is to get thrown in this kind of environment and expected to swim. Having people there to go to for advice, comfort, or even just general validation, makes everything feel more real, that everything overwhelming isn’t just something I made up in my head. some upperclassmen i go to for support, and for entertainment at their expense. I was froshy, because college made me feel like a child again, like a toddler first trying a banana, or a middle schooler first picking a fight. Everything is treated like an experience to be cherished. As freshman year is coming to a close, like most other people, I’ve “defroshed”. I’m starting to see cracks in the system I can’t change, and larger problems out of my control, but I’m still fairly energetic about things. I respect the upperclassmen resilient enough to remain somewhat froshy despite their years at this institute, curious and willing to try new things. The concept of jadedness scares me a little. I’ve seen the toll it takes on my peers, and my parents as well, albeit from vastly different things. College lasts around 4 years, and the jadedness ends there as a new era starts. But what happens when you start to get jaded from life in general? When new things no longer excite you, conversations start repeating, and everything feels already happened, what are you supposed to do with yourself? I tell people my greatest fear is boredom, and I suppose this is what I mean. When I’m groggily brushing my teeth in the morning, collapsed in the doorway of my room from a long day, or crying into my friends’ arms, I’m happy. My life could be in shambles, and this will still be the happiest I’ve ever been, because this year I am finally alive again.

My favorite dish in the whole wide world is called
 
pakaprow. ⁠ 01 spelling variations include Pad Gaprao, Pad Kra Pao, Pad Kraprow, etc.  So, what is this dish? Pakaprow is a spicy Thai basil meat stir fry. The sensation of cooking it is always such a riot. Spicy smoke fills the room and the cook always ends up coughing and crying, unless they’re well-acquainted with the difficulties of this dish. It’s almost like an
 
ayahuasca ceremony, ⁠ 02 plant-based psychedelic ritual (FYI: I have never done one and have only heard of them) a snippet of when I had it in Thailand, where my family is from It holds sentimental value because it’s the only dish that every adult in my immediate family has cooked for me. My mother’s version leaned sweet and had perfect texture; my father’s was a funny amalgamation of flavors; my uncle’s was, by far, the spiciest; and my aunt’s version best highlighted Thai basil. Everyone had their own take and I enjoyed all of them. I love my Thai culture and how it has

This glum experience made me all the more surprised to see people in college so excited to try my Thai cooking, let alone enjoy it. It was refreshing. Perhaps there’s something about being somewhere new and starting fresh that enables people to be more open-minded. I don’t know, really. But, at the very least, what I do know is that I, along with the people around me, loved sharing this dish together for the past 2 years. During every season of MIT life, different situations have prompted me to  learn how to make this dish in incrementally more-difficult styles, all of which I had never attempted before…  (Beast) 
TT: Kano’s making some Thai dish iirc. but yeah, I was panicking cause I walk out into the Bemis hallway and suddenly feel an extremely strong urge to cough 
TM: @Kanokwan is this the same dish as before? that shit was brutal 
Kano: yeee 
TS: It melted my face clean off when I tried it As the months went by during freshman year, I started sharing the dish with people on
 
Beast. ⁠ 05 a floor at my dorm East Campus  warmed my heart to see people not only enjoy the dish, but also learn how to make it themselves.  (pika) The summer after freshman year, I lived at pika: an MIT independent living group where we cooked and cleaned together. One day, I was the lead cook and decided to make pakaprow for the MANY people that ate our daily dinners. Not only had I never made it for nearly that many people before, but I had never had to accommodate for so many different food preferences: gluten-free, vegetarian, non-spicy, dairy-free, and all that jazz. It was a little scary, but I think that made it all the more exciting.  (CPW event) from the East Campus CPW schedule This sophomore year, I was roped into making the dish for a
 
Campus Preview Weekend ⁠ 06 a weekend where admitted students visit MIT to experience a ton of fun events and, in that process, see all that we have to offer

MW: according to gage and alex(2026s) I would probably win that (I had to eat carolina peppers laced ramen). it depends if its served hot, if it is, I will just vomit, if not I can scarf it. 
SI: @Kanokwan cooked something so spicy once that just existing in the kitchen was enough to cause coughing fits 
SS: It was honestly such a phenomenon. I’ve never experienced spice like that before or since 
KK: Homemade pepper spray? 
YF: Literally 
KC: it made me cry

SS: No you shouldn’t be. We merely gripe about our mortal ills 
KC: always. 
TD: Don’t be, it tasted so good 
DA: I have power Carolina reaper and flakes ghost pepper and Trinidad scorpion if needed for this trial. (Would also love to participate) 
Kano: vasss i would also love to make pakaprow again. I have Thai peppers and the magic of a mortar and pestle 
MW: i chewed on in my roce and i had the oils of this burst in the back of my throat. not fun. *one that was in my roce 
YI: wait this sounds based af. would love to help with this endeavor 
Kano: omg yes I will take all the help I can get. it’s a ~journey~ best trekked with others 
SE: yes spicy food homies It was funny watching the time lag of spice hit people. They would insist that they were fine, but, after a few moments, would be downing massive amounts of water (which I absolutely do NOT recommend because capsaicin, the chemical that triggers the spice sensation, is oil-based and would only be moved around in your mouth to trigger even more pain receptors), ice (which somewhat helps because it numbs your tongue, but will ultimately result in the same fate as drinking water), and milk (which is very good because it actually breaks the bonds between capsaicin and taste buds). My personal favorite remedy is to slowly chew on carbs, typically rice (because it absorbs the capsaicin). Previous Next I’ve hyped up this dish enough already that I might as well share my recipe. Apologies for the lack of measurements: it’s very vibes-based (I used to be annoyed at my mom doing this, but look at me now 🤦🏻‍♀️). This version certainly isn’t the only way to make it, but, at the very least, how I do it. Grind  up Thai chili peppers and garlic cloves in a mortar and pestle.  Alternatively, putting the chilis through a food processor or finely chopping could work work, but it’ll be a bit different. The manually mashing of the pestle causes the breakdown of the ingredients’ cell walls and that, in turn, releases the spice and tang of the respective ingredients.  Fry  that mixture in oil. This step is basically just creating fresh chili oil. Mash  in the protein. Once the garlic turns golden, put your protein in the pan. Then, with a wooden spatula, mash the protein such that it starts to break apart into little pieces (roughly 1 cm cubes). Keep mashing until the protein is all broken up. The staple protein is ground pork, but you can substitute any protein here. Chicken breast, diced tofu, seitan, whatever suits your fancy. Pour  in each of these sauces. You don’t have to have these exact brands; these are just the ones my family uses. Squid fish sauce Kwong Hung Seng thin soy sauce Maekrua oyster sauce Golden Mountain seasoning sauce Toss  in Thai basil leaves. Mix up the dish for 1 more minute then turn off the heat.  Voila!  Serve with Jasmine rice and a sunny side egg for full authenticity. I like to tack on a bitter melon soup as well. Sometimes, I make an ~illegal~ combination and instead of eating it with rice, I dump it into a bowl of mac and cheese. It is such a fantastic melding of flavors; I feel like Remy from the movie Ratatouille every time I have the combo. Whenever I was homesick last year (and I mean   homesick), I made pakaprow. No matter where I was in the world, I knew this dish would always feels like a hug from home. Food is so much more than just sustenance: it’s an experience that tingles your senses, elicits a consistent bit of joy, captures memories, and acts as means of communion. It’s a part of life we all have to partake in anyways, so we might as well relish in it.  To quote the above almond can that I snacked from while studying one late night,  “crave victoriously.” #Cooking #CPW #East Campus #pika

a few weeks ago someone wanted to shoot a music video and needed a few dozen extras in the background, so they made a big group chat and added me to it. i wasn’t friends with any of the other extras, but there were a lot of people whom i recognized from classes or activities a few years ago and hadn’t seen recently, and we had some pleasant conversations while filming. afterwards i realized i enjoyed talking to them and wanted to learn more about them, and then i also realized i simply did not have enough time to get to know everyone i wanted to even though i’m graduating in a few weeks, i haven’t stopped meeting new students here and trying to understand them as well as possible, and i plan to continue doing so up until the very end. i know this is a foolish endeavor from a friend-making perspective, but i really enjoy hearing new kinds of stories even if i don’t end up becoming friends with the person telling the stories. i think maybe that’s one of the reasons i’ve been getting more interested in film and theater lately i’ve been coming to terms with the fact that there’s nothing special about stem. this semester i’ve enjoyed learning about distributed systems and statistics and cell biology and statistical physics, but i’ve also enjoyed talking to a wide variety of people and absorbing their perspectives. those two kinds of information are very different from each other, but i don’t think one is more interesting or more valuable than the other; they’re just  different , and empirically speaking it seems like i’m equally good at picking up both kinds of information and if there’s nothing special about stem, then as a corollary there really isn’t any reason i need to be working in stem. for instance, ever since i committed to doing ai research after school, my friends have been bugging me with questions about ai policy (specifically, how to deal with the socioeconomic effects of widespread automation) and these questions actually feel around as interesting to me as actual ai research does. this is a disorienting realization to have because i’ve spent my whole life doing stem, but it’s not so different from the realization i had a few years ago that i didn’t have to limit myself to math and that the rest of stem was interesting too anyway, all this is to say that lately i’ve been obsessed with seeking out as many stories as i can, and the awareness that i have more stories left to hear than hours left at mit has made me sad. at the same time, i know this is a futile quest anyway; even if i did understand everything there was to understand about my friends, i would simply move onto my friends of friends, and so on. there is no end to this task, and perhaps the goal shouldn’t be to finish it recently i encountered my first true instance of decision paralysis, when i was trying to figure out who to hang out with in my remaining time here, and i found myself utterly unable to prioritize or decide between people. i hate group hangouts, so choosing to see one person necessarily meant choosing not to see someone else, and ultimately i decided that i didn’t want to optimize my social life so i would just not actively choose anything; instead i just go about my days and the people i happen to run into end up being the people i hang out with sometimes i feel like a sitting duck, refusing to make decisions of my own and simply waiting around for the end of the world. but i’ve been happy with the results so far, and i’m not sure i’d be able to accurately optimize my schedule even if i did try to. i’ve never been great at predicting how much i’ll enjoy a conversation or a hangout before these things actually happen

# The void is calling to you. You speak to the machines. You rose closer with the sun today, shivered on the way to lab, the morning pale and grey. There are jobs that need doing in the basement by the street, where a massive CNC machine chatters and hums. You’re breathing foul chemicals you do not know the name of. They make the metal that you cut look clean.  One piece you cut is fine and smooth, but the next has flaws in the designs. Someone else, perhaps as sleepless as yourself, forgot half the holes and channels. You set to fixing it, blinking through a tired haze. Your hands tremble with caffeine, this old well-trodden routine. This time you know the remedies: you trace the cuts, the way the machine will go. You set a probe in the machine, a thin stick with a delicate and costly red glass ball at the end, and send it slowly shooting down. The void then does not call, it screams:  smash it.  Just to see the ball shatter. To remove the fear of messing up. You could crush that scarlet globe and the world would not crack. The shopmasters would not even be angry, just annoyed, and you’d have to spend time inserting a new probe. You stop the probe one inch above your stock piece, tell the machine to measure the distance between the two. The void reduces to a whisper. Nothing breaks, and the work progresses but isn’t finished entirely. You will be back again tomorrow. Next you rush down the halls, crowded now with people. You find a different basement lab — the forge — which is usually sweltering but right now is simply warm. The taciturn forgemaster with the tattoo sleeve, whose name your little sister said came out of the fantasy novels you both used to read, is showing a student blocks of plaster with cast bronze medallions inside. The forgemaster lifts one block high and lets it smash to the ground. Plaster explodes to all sides. The three of you spend the next half hour chipping at the parts of plaster that didn’t break, freeing the bronze medallions. The student asks for gloves, but you’ve had worse chemicals beneath your skin. You chip away the plaster as it dries your hands, makes your forearms itch. Then there is class you’re only somewhat late for, where you are spoon-fed MatLab line by line.  Next you are at your UROP lab, above ground but with no windows, pulling on a man’s green smock and floppy leather gloves. You’re welding a fuel tank. You put on crashing metal music, but the air filtration system drowns out all other sound. You turn on the welder — it’s a TIG welder which is akin to a massive, bright solder. Your hands and arms are covered so the brightness doesn’t sear your skin, but you are wearing ripped jeans. If you do it right, nothing will spark, no molten metal will fly onto your skin.  The electric circuit of the welder is operated with a foot pedal. Press down and electricity will flow. When you turn on the machine and grip the welding tip in hand, mask up, eyes exposed, the void rushes up through you. You could hit the pedal, shoot electricity into the air; you are at least 90% sure that nothing would happen. A google search tells you 100%. Even so. You imagine a shock passing through you, enough energy to melt metal shooting through you to the floor. Your foot is itching over the pedal the way it never does over the gas, in a car, when the results are much more dire. But you don’t dare. Instead you tip the mask down, set the weld tip to the metal, start a spark and a circuit between the two. The void falls away but as you fall into the work it keeps returning. When soldering, nothing will burn unless it’s within a centimeter of the solder gun; it’s easy to hold the solder wire from a proper distance. With welding, your gloves begin to heat up four inches away. You’ve seen two-inch-long wire bits, proof a more experienced welder could bring the wire closer and closer. Or perhaps a welder with heftier gloves. Even so, every time you get near the end, your fingers edge closer and closer, feeling a heat soak into the leather. Sometimes it burns, and you whip off the glove, press your fingers to your lips.  You don’t finish the project but you’re nearly there, and no disaster happened, no burn marks on the gloves or your skin. Finally it’s forging time. You stretch and wander down the outfinite, where the evening light is grey. You’ve been with the machines all day. In the forge you’re crafting a dragon, which means holding chisels and various hand tools close to hot metal, hammering them at awkward angles. The chisels drink the heat from the workpiece, until they too are searing hot, so you wear gloves. The gloves heat up; when you return the piece to the fire, you take them off, feel the warm palms. You lean over the dragon, checking on the growth of his teeth or his horns. He’s not red anymore but that is the most dangerous, when the metal is grey but just barely. Your brain doesn’t register the heat this way. The void whispers to grab the thing in your bare hands. At one point you smell burning hair, a stray strand that touched the dragon.  When the dragon is red-hot the void rises again, conjures the burn and bubble of skin if you wrapped your whole hand around its head. You keep hammering. The dragon’s nose and eyes emerge, his angry eyebrows, the curl of his lower horns.  You’ve burned yourself a couple times in here, but always through carelessness or a bad stroke of luck. This time you are careful, wary of your tiredness, how easy a mistake would be. You think of the work you choose, where mistakes are dangerous. Your deepest scar is from this year. How many craftsmen are missing chunks of their fingers.  On bad nights, when you were young, you dreamt of crashing cars: careening down the street however much you slammed the brake, deadly straight for all that you yanked the steering wheel.   Now you dream of the machines. When the alarm rips you from sleep it’s pulling you from sharp spinning blades eating your hair, rapidly drawing your head to the blade. Spinning wire brushes wipe the skin from your fingers. Pounding hammers smash through bones— But that isn’t common. At least not for you to remember you wake; these dreams are buried in your REM cycles, the few that you can scrape. They are a wariness, a warning. The void is not usually so strong. Maybe it’s the caffeine. Maybe tomorrow you’ll get more sleep before you speak to the machines.

 I3 ⁠ 01 Interactive Introduction to the Institute covers the walls of East Campus however, MIT has recently been shifting away from murals. of the existing dorms, there used to be four buildings where murals were permitted; now, there are just two. Burton Conner and New House were renovated, and with the greater investment in the buildings came more constraints, including a bar on
 
permanent murals. ⁠ 02 aka murals that go directly on the walls East Campus and Random Hall are the only mural buildings left, and East Campus is going offline for renovation at the end of this year. after renewal, students won’t be able to mural directly on the walls, but will instead have access to “fake walls” that enable them to paint freely in a removable way. emphasis on removable. unfortunately, Burton Conner didn’t end up with this solution. instead, we got a handful of hanging canvases that are dispersed throughout our floors. it’s a far cry from the way things used to be, and students aren’t thrilled with it, which is why the discussion feels very much incomplete. in my years of involvement in Burton Conner government, I’ve seen how staunch administration seems in their decision to oust murals. I did, however, get a glimmer of hope when the Associate Provost of Campus Planning agreed to meet with a group of students regarding murals during this semester. he was incredible, voicing support for student self expression and affirming our assertion that murals are instrumental in fostering a sense of ownership over a space. despite this, we couldn’t quite see a solution to the issue, but in a follow-up meeting, we discussed some of the underlying reasons why MIT is phasing out muraling. these include: students don’t always comply with regulations. they get too attached to their murals, which makes necessary repairs difficult. sometimes, students paint where they shouldn’t, and egress maps/signage/emergency devices are obscured.  students have a lot to say about this list, but our rebuttal hasn’t enacted much change thus far. the debate is still in the works and will likely continue for the next couple of years. I’ll be long gone, but I have a lot of faith in the underclassmen to pick up the torch. in the meantime, we’re trying our best to make our dorm feel like home. since I blogged about the  murals of Burton Conner without further ado… B1 was the first floor to put stuff on their walls. they did an amazing job, and I really admire their creativity. logo board the floor logo, with bones for b-one painted by a ’25, inspired by Georgia O’Keeffe painted by a ’25, design is from Pinterest (slay) hookup graph mural a recreation of a pre-’20 mural, painted by a current ’23. Previous Next the burton two peanut gallery a recreation of the mural that used to be in the stairwell outside B2. toucan mural painted by a ’25 with only three colors and one brush that was never cleaned between colors! depicts a toucan, the floor mascot birthday straw mural a collaboration between multiple B2 residents to celebrate a ’25’s birthday. B2 plans surprise midnight floor celebration activities for people’s birthdays, and they planned decorating this because the ’25 likes straws and abstract art. a collaboration between Burton 2 and Burton 5. Burton Conner floors get Inter-Floor Activity Fund (IFAF) money to host socials between floors, and this mural was a product of one. some more (unfinished) murals: Previous Next my floor! of our art, some was painted by students and some was sourced from Belgian graffiti artists who gave some of their work to a hackathon. our logo board this is an old design sourced from our extensive Google Drive of floor artwork and logos. it’s nice to use previous designs since it feels like we’re maintaining a connection to the pre-renovation floor even though art from decades past is no longer on our walls. this is called   and was painted by a freshman, who called it a collection of random things that just popped into her mind. mural based on   by Tame Impala this was designed in 2020 by a current senior. it’s straightforward but great since   is one of the most influential albums on the floor in recent history. tape mural this was the first art we put on our walls. I knew I wanted to do something with tape since it’s removable and easy to use, so I found a picture on Google as inspiration and went to town. more and more people joined me, and we completed this ‘mural’ in a matter of hours. pink panther mural another tape mural, but much more creative! done by a ’24. my pride and joy! I made this early in the year to add some life to my painfully blank suite walls. I’m pretty proud of it. Previous Next all of these were sourced from the Belgian graffiti artist except the tape mural and records, which were painted by the floor. I really enjoy the diversity of art we have, and although it’s not like how things used to be, I’m happy that the walls aren’t bare, at least. the logo board, inspired by a mural painted by three ’21s and a ’23 that was on pre-renovation B4. painted by a ’24.

Previous Next Previous Next before the renovation began, each floor was given the opportunity to preserve one of their murals in high quality. these were printed onto canvases and are now hanging in the lobby on the first floor. Previous Next and that’s that! it’s interesting to see how current art compares with pre-renovation murals. several floors retained at least one old work, which is nice for longevity purposes, but most art is new. some floors stuck with using canvases, while others brought in new materials, like tape, records, and tapestries. the state of art in the dorm has definitely changed, but it’s still vibrant despite the new restrictions we have. you may have noticed how the majority of art here was painted by ’24s and younger. these are the students who never lived in the dorm prior to renewal and are only just experiencing what it’s like to be a member of a BC community. considering this, I think it’s wonderful that the younger classes have literal blank canvases to work on. having the ability to make art is an incredible means of bringing people together to shape a floor environment, and I’m happy to see the diversity of art that’s erupted around the dorm thus far. it’s a shame that no paint is directly on the walls, but hey, we’re definitely managing.

Approximately two weeks ago in Building 14 ( the a hack was put up celebrating the brilliant and diverse faculty, professors, and staff in
 
SHASS. ⁠ 01 School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences Before the area was hacked, the wall in Building 14 highlighted several economists such as Joshua Angrist, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Peter Diamond among a few others. And while these economists deserve recognition for their contributions to MIT, well, I think this message from the hackers says it best: We recognize and appreciate the incredible contributions that the Economics Faculty displayed here have made to both MIT and their fields. However, we disagree with the values inherent in the choices of this display and are recreating it to better reflect the diverse departments and people of SHASS. The specific values and choices we disagree with are as follows: 1. By centering the Department of Economics, this display chooses to center one of the whitest and most male departments in SHASS over other, more diverse departments. 2. By centering the Field of Economics, this display further perpetuates the technical bias pervasive at MIT that the value of a field of research, knowledge, and exploration is linked to its “technical rigor.” SHASS is composed of humanists, artists, and social scientists, but this display reinforces the notation that even in SHASS, the fields involving more technical and scientific modes of inquiry are more valuable and worthy of celebration. 3. By centering the Nobel Prize in Economics, this display is centering an award that has historically had a massive diversity problem and overlooked countless exemplary contributions of women, People of Color, and people from the Global South to their fields and the communities they work with. This is not to say that the individuals recognized here do not deserve recognition but rather that in choosing to display only these individuals in a corridor dedicated to all of SHASS ignores the contributions of other fields and individuals, particularly those that are not white cis-men. – And recreate the display they did. They, without obstructing the posters of the economists mind you, covered the wall with numerous diverse members of SHASS. Previous Next The entire list of faculty members added to the display is included at the end of this blogpost. I reached out to some SHASS faculty and some of the professors included in the new exhibit for comment, and recieved the following: The Dean’s Office is postponing the installation of a planned new exhibit until this summer, and the hack will stay in play until then. We want that space to celebrate the entire SHASS community, and agree [with the hackers] that excellence comes from across our school. –  Additionally, There are so many things I love about the hack in the hallway of Building 14. Although it criticizes MIT, it does so in a thoughtful, positive way, ending with an incitement to celebrate SHASS, and giving a lucid, balanced explanation of the students’ concerns about the current display. The hack is appropriately low-tech: its tool is not technological wizardry but images and the written word, infused with careful critical thinking—a tribute to SHASS in style as well as substance. It provides a great opportunity to reflect on what MIT stands for. –  The hackers concluded their message by welcoming others to create a space that celebrates all of SHASS: We hope you will join us in reimagining this space as one that represents and highlights the work of all members of SHASS. While the changes we have made have taken a step in that direction, there are still others who we were not able to include here, from SHASS staff to librarians to many of the SHASS affiliated artists. We invite you to contribute the pieces that we overlooked! Add a shout-out to a SHASS professor, lecturer, or affiliate on the chalkboard or print out a page yourself and add it to the wall. Let’s create a space that visualizes and appreciates all of SHASS together. – The hack is to be preserved in the Institute Archives. :

I’ve been doing more reading recently, so wanted to share! “Detail of the Rice Chest” by Monica Youn My friend Alec attended the L.A. Times Festival of Books recently and heard Monica Youn read this poem. They were completely blown away—I think their exact words were something like “I didn’t know poetry could do that”. It isn’t  the same experience, reading it online, but still. An absolutely stunning, incisive portrait of Asian Americanness. “At the Clinic” by Sally Rooney I love  , and this short story is a predecessor to the novel, featuring Marianne and Connell. There’s a sentence in this story I keep coming back to.  That sense of resignation—not even attempting to cross the abyss—Rooney is sharp for that observation. Anne Carson, The Art of Poetry No. 88 An extraordinarily dense interview. I didn’t get through all of it, and I don’t think I’ll be able to process everything I did read. She articulates so much of the role writing plays in my own life: Y The Age of Innocence , Edith Wharton I found this in my living group’s library and started it on a whim. I’ve often found it difficult to get through historical books—admittedly, old-timey prose can be dry—but this one is absolutely captivating and so relevant even a century later; I guess some things don’t change. Her sentences sparkle, but the most impressive achievement, I think, is in the whip-smart observations on human nature. Shamir’s secret sharing Figured I should share something technical. Recently learned about this secret-sharing algorithm, which exploits the Lagrange interpolation theorem, which you may have learned about in a high school algebra class. I found it very clever! Like with most other cryptography, no idea if I’ll ever get to apply it in the real world, but as an intellectual puzzle, it’s fun. here

my favorite part of ancient greek literature is its treatment of self-fulfilling prophecies. oedipus’s parents learn that he will kill his father and marry his mother, so they abandon him, enabling a future where he doesn’t recognize his parents and therefore kills his father and marries his mother by accident. cronos learns one of his sons will overthrow him, so he eats his children, causing his son zeus to hate him and eventually overthrow him. these narratives are interesting from a storytelling perspective because they reveal their own endings early on and yet somehow the act of spoilage makes them  more  engaging, not less there are no oracles in real life, but self-fulfilling prophecies certainly exist. the classical example is  learned helplessness : in the original experiment, dogs in the control group were placed in an environment where they were shocked repeatedly and the shocking would only stop if they jumped over a hoop. in such a scenario, all the dogs quickly learned to jump over the hoop. meanwhile, dogs in the experimental group were shocked repeatedly regardless of what they did, and then they were placed in the same environment as the control group, at which point they did not attempt to jump over the hoop or do anything else to stop the shocks, presumably because they’d acquired an assumption that the shocks were inevitable learned helplessness occurs all the time in humans as well. i’ve written about this idea before, in the context of  friendships  (we often assume we are powerless to help our friends resolve their issues so we choose not to help them and in doing so become powerless) and  career decisions  (we often assume we can’t make progress on difficult problems so we pick easier career paths and in doing so ensure that we don’t make progress on said problems). or, for a more concrete example, consider math education in the usa – one common anecdote educators report is of children getting lost during a math class, feeling that they “can’t do” math, and not trying as hard in subsequent classes as a result, ultimately resulting in them not being able to do math. (to be clear, i’m not trying to fault the students here; i think math curriculums need to be restructured to give students better avenues for recovering and catching up) self-fulfilling prophecies have played an important role in how i experience attraction. i remember a few years ago one of my friends asked me  “do you believe in true love?”  and my response was something like  i haven’t personally experienced true love and am not sure if i ever will, but i believe that some people experience it, and i believe that people who expect to experience true love are more likely to do so than people who don’t expect it , and that’s a response i would still stand by today. or, for another example, i spent the first twenty years of my life consuming media telling me that i was supposed to date conventionally attractive females and eventually have sex with them, and because that was my expectation for what relationships should look like i experienced physical attraction to conventionally attractive females and tried to date them. it wasn’t until two years ago that i realized i didn’t actually care that much about traditional beauty standards and was probably asexual, and once i made that realization i started experiencing significantly less physical attraction in general. it’s truly bizarre that expecting to feel things can cause you to feel them, and changing those expectations can make the feelings change here are some of the prophecies on my mind these days: that it’s very hard to make friends after college (my friends who believe this tend to not put much effort into meeting new people, whereas other people i know tend to go to more events and search harder and find more people they like). that you stop learning once you have a job (my friends who agree with this tend to not bother learning much outside of what their jobs teach them, whereas my friends who still believe in learning tend to continue reading and experimenting and building projects in their free time). that life in general peaks during college and is less interesting afterwards (my friends who accept this tend to settle into relatively monotonous routines after starting work, whereas other people i know tend to continue trying new things and exploring more of the world) these prophecies are all statements i’ve heard repeated over and over in my life, and yet, when i look at people i know who are older than me, only the ones who subscribe to these predictions seem to be affected by them. so i can’t help but wonder – what if none of these prophecies are actually destiny, and the reason they come to pass is because we believe in them? what if we could change the future simply by believing otherwise? of course faith alone does not accomplish anything – i don’t believe in “manifesting”, and i’m not a superstitious person – but faith is still valuable because it serves as the basis for all the work that must come afterwards when i look into the future i see a minefield of self-fulfilling prophecies and self-reinforcing patterns, and i consider which ones i want to set off and which ones i want to avoid. this is why i think it is important to pick one’s beliefs carefully; this is why i choose to believe life in the future will be better than it is in the present; this is why i tell people optimism is the correct response to uncertainty and failure, no matter how counterintuitive it may seem i don’t know how to accomplish the goals i want to accomplish or how to bring about the futures i want to live in, but i know that before anything else i must first believe these things are possible

If you missed  part 1 of the Fredventure , be sure to check that out in addition to this post. We also recently performed our Brazilian music at MIT President Sally Kornbluth’s inauguration party this past weekend –  go and give it a listen ! Day 4 A top-down shot of the rainforest. I’d never held onto my phone so tightly before taking this photo. Day 4 was the highlight of my trip because we did so many awesome activities that day. Our first stop was the  Museu da Amazônia  (MUSA for short), where we got to hike around in the thickets of the rainforest. At MUSA, we were split into several different tour groups; my group started at the main attraction – a 42-meter-tall observation tower looming above the rainforest canopy. The view from there was breathtaking, with trees as far as the eye could see. However, we couldn’t stay up there for long – it was also scorching hot, and a few of us even pulled out our umbrellas to shield ourselves from the sun. An (honestly kind of bad) panorama of the rainforest I took from the observation tower. The things we saw back on the ground certainly didn’t disappoint either. Our guide, a zoologist with an extremely keen eye, could spot even the tiniest, most well-camouflaged critters among the leaves. At one point, he even casually scooped up a snake from the ground while we walked! Previous Next “Guys, smell the snake!” he told us. So I smelled it. It smelled awful. Not sure what I was expecting, honestly. The rest of the special exhibits (giant sloth/crocodile skeletons, giant fish, and giant water lilies) flew by quickly. That is until we got to the arachnids exhibit (finally, some small things!). Did you know that arachnids make up 10% of all arthropods in the rainforest? Or that adult scorpions glow bright cyan under UV light? I certainly did at the end of our tour because our zoologist was really into arachnids. Like really,  really  into arachnids. So much so that we spent more than an hour at that exhibit. (Though, it was interesting to learn that baby scorpions don’t glow under UV light because they don’t produce the necessary fluorescent protein.) Surprisingly, we weren’t the last group to finish, even though we spent what seemed like an eternity staring at tarantulas. (It turned out that one of the other groups all decided to get fruit juice at some random juice bar in the middle of their tour.) While we waited, I read some local myths they had posted around the place. My favourite was the  story of “Devil with No Ass” , which… is certainly one way of explaining why we have electric eels. That evening, we finally saw the famous  Teatro Amazonas  in person. When Fred told us the theatre would be pink, I imagined a muted pink that blends in with the background; I would never have imagined it to be bright, Barbie-dream-house pink instead. Barbie Dream (Opera) House. In the theatre, we listened to a thrilling jazz concert performed by our own FJE and a local jazz ensemble. It was incredible how well the two groups played together despite not speaking the same language. I later learned that FJE only found out they’d be performing a few hours before the concert, but I never would’ve guessed. And the cherry on top? For dinner, we went to a restaurant that served us 15 different types of pizza, each with a distinct Brazilian twist. (Unfortunately, this included a cupuaçu dessert pizza, but I suppose you can’t win them all.) Not sure which pizza Fred is eating in this gif. Day 5 After FJE’s performance the previous evening, everyone in MITWE was itching to play some music as a group too. Luckily for us, the first activity of the fifth day was meeting and improvising with indigenous percussionist and instrument maker  Eliberto Barroncas It was quite amazing how Eliberto’s instruments (all made from natural materials he harvested himself or reused plastic) sounded uncannily like the rainforest itself; we later learned that those instruments were originally used for hunting and made to mimic animal noises. For dinner, we went to another
 
“floating restaurant” ⁠ 01 Is an airplane a floating restaurant? Is a pop tart a ravioli? We got into some heated debates about these questions; drop your best arguments in the comments below. (Just kidding, the fish ribs actually tasted decent, against all my expectations about fish.) Day 6 Day 6’s main activity was touring the  Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia  (INPA) – Brazil’s premier institute for rainforest research. First, we listened to a few talks by VJE’s Talia K. and two of INPA’s scientists. I was surprised to learn about their research facilities there, including a cleanroom (akin to MIT.nano) and a  325-meter-tall observation tower  (taller than the Eiffel Tower), all in the middle of the rainforest! Previous Next We then took a campus tour and saw all sorts of exotic plants and animals, including an albino turtle and a sloth eating cacao! (No birds, unfortunately; apparently none of their favourite fruits was in season yet.) They even had manatees there! “Manatee” in Portuguese is “peixe-boi” (literally “fish cow”), but it’s pronounced almost like “pastry boy”. So when I heard Talia excitedly refer to them in Portuguese, I initially thought she was comparing them to the Pillsbury Doughboy because of their rotund bodies. Just before lunch, there were a few more talks. First, we watched the winning entry to the 2023 Dance Your PhD competition in the biology category, which was filmed at INPA. Next, some of MITWE/FJE’s own gave presentations – Axel V. (on engineering anti-CRISPR variants), Rachel M. (on a CubeSat she recently launched), and Scott S. (on the science of disaster movies). I was still pretty excited about seeing a sloth up close earlier that day, so when they let us choose between seeing reptiles/amphibians and a science museum they had on campus, I chose the former option without hesitation. Unfortunately, they failed to mention that the animals wouldn’t necessarily be alive. At least the snakes look pretty I guess? As soon as I stepped foot into the reptiles/amphibians room, I was hit with the stench of death. Indeed, every single reptile and amphibian in that room was suspended in formaldehyde and other nasty chemicals. I still don’t understand how the researchers there can stand working in that room all day, but kudos to them for doing so. We had a few hours of free time back at the hotel, so I went to a nearby mall to try some fresh açai (which everyone had been recommending). That decision was by far my best decision of the day. The açai was delicious (and tasted much better than the açai in the US), and the mall also had a mini rainforest in the center. I even got a Brazilian Happy Meal at the end of the excursion! Previous Next We’re just two days away from the big concert at the end of the trip! Stick around for the third and final part of the Fredventure, which I’ll post (hopefully) next week. #Brazil #Course 21M - Music and Theatre Arts #MITWE

Content warning: depression, suicidal ideation. The other day my therapist asked me about when I get depressive episodes. And I said that I got them after I’d come home from class, or after a meeting, when I’d come back to my room after a long day of being outside with friends. It’s not that anything in particular triggers it. I’ll be sitting in front of my computer doing work, and then I’d be struck with an inexplicable sadness, filling my body like helium. All the energy would leave me and I’d lie on my bed, staring into space, thinking about how worthless I felt, or how pointless this all was, and how maybe it’d be better if I didn’t wake up this morning. I once told my psychiatrist that it’s awful how the episodes have the most convenient timings. Never before a call I have to be on or a class I have to go to. When a friend was sleeping over, it started in the afternoon and ended an hour before he came back. It doesn’t interfere with my schedule, or the work that   to get done, but it does mean I never have a therapy session happening an hour after a breakdown. Good that I have things scheduled, then. Good that I know how to fill my weeknights and weekends with things to do and meetings to go to. SIPB on Mondays, Squares on Tuesdays, ESP on Wednesdays, ET on Thursdays. A cappella concerts and worksessions and game nights. Because having something on the calendar keeps me happy, literally. Then what happens when the summer hits, when I graduate, when I move out of Boston? I’m scared that I’m going to leave this place and I won’t have things to do and then I’ll spend most of my time being depressed in my room. The last time I had my weekly cadence torn apart was when the pandemic first hit. And that was a bad time for me. Looking at the posts I made at the time,  at least i’m not as sad as i used to be warmth next to normal The other day Andrew L. ’22 visited MIT, and I told him about this, and he said that knowing me, I’ll find other things to do. New York is a big city, right? I’ll find something to go to, or set up something myself. I mean, that might be true, who knows? It’s different without the infrastructure of being in college though, when there’s a huge event in the beginning of the year with hundreds of student groups actively trying to recruit you. Either way, I’m leaving all these circles I’m in, and I’m going to have to find new ones.

“Where have you been?” Dear Reader, I’m not sure if I can begin to even explain where I’ve been. At the risk of sounding edgy, I’ve spent the past month and a half feeling as though I am floating. Days passed and they would blur into one another, I neglected my responsibilities in favor of going out and wasting the night away, and ultimately just playing a game of  . As of late, I’ve been watching my life happen before my eyes like a movie of some sort instead of actively living it and participating in it. I was recently asked by my friend “Are you okay?” and in response, I described a bunch of things going on in my life. And she cut me off in the middle to say “Cam, those are things that are happening to you, but  ?” I didn’t have a good answer for her. Since the breakup, I’ve felt like things are just happening to me. I just happen to wake up everyday and go to class and see friends. Parties happen to me and I meet people and I talk to people and I happen to have a good time. These past weeks have been incredibly hazy for me. It feels as though I’ve just blinked and it suddenly went from March 7 to suddenly the beginning of May and frankly, I’m terrified. I indulged in a particularly hedonistic weekend in the desert of California at Coachella a couple of days ago. It felt incredibly peak “Dorian Gray”, surrounded by people drunk or high off their asses, dressed up in these elaborate fantastical outfits, splurging on drinks and food as they swayed to music that would kill a Victorian child. There was something incredibly freeing in it, as I inhaled smoke and sweat and dust, enough of it to know that my lungs will probably be permanently damaged from this weekend. And as I stared at the blinding lights from the stage in front of me, I felt incredibly at peace, for the first time in a long, long time. Even though my description of Coachella must sound incredibly nightmarish, it felt the perfect amount of indulgent, the perfect amount of letting loose, living without a single care in the world. I think for the past month and a half I’ve been carrying   with me. This baggage. This idea that in this single era I should be living my life in X way or Y way, that I should be using this time to find myself. I’ve felt a certain kind of pressure to do  to be   And under all this pressure, I felt myself crumble and shut down completely. Where I’m normally so in touch with who I am and what I’m feeling, I’ve felt somewhat cut off from my inner thoughts. When I try to think of   I’m feeling, all I get is static in response, like talking to a brick wall. It’s been strange operating myself in this state, wandering through life like a ghost and trying to find different ways to ground myself. My thoughts feel incredibly scattered. I don’t really know what I’m supposed to be doing at points in time or where I should be. I’ve been so forgetful lately and slacking off on work, turning in work that I’m not proud of, neglecting my jobs, feeling distant from everything. There’s a part of me that feels incredibly   and ashamed of these outcomes. I know that these things are tied to my breakup. And I   by my decision to exit the relationship. But if I’m the one that did all the breaking up, why am I acting out like this? (I feel obligated to put a disclaimer here — I don’t regret anything I’ve done. I’m happy with the new people I’ve connected with and friends that I’ve made, even if I’m in a disoriented state. And I’m grateful to the people that have been around, both old and new.) Really, I think a lot of this ties to the fact that for all my life, I’ve had a plan. Since elementary school, it’s felt like I’ve been on a fixed trajectory. I do well in middle school to get into a good high school and get good placements in classes. I do well in high school to get into a good college. I do well in college to get a good high paying job and move in with my boyfriend and live in New York City for the rest of my life and live out my days…doing what exactly? Settling down and getting married? Having kids? I’ve realized I don’t   what I want in life. And really I think that ironically is the answer to everything I’m feeling. I’m not okay with not knowing and I   to learn to be okay with it. There’s some part of me that feels so liberated by the phrase. I don’t know.  . But then there’s a greater part of me that is terrified. To not know what these next 6 months to look like. To throw away my stable, healthy future for…something so confusing and unclear and ambiguous. I feel this pressure to do better because I know the life that I could have had. My life could have been cushy Upper East Side apartments. It could have been stability with a boyfriend/husband that adored me and loved me to the world’s end. It could have been romantic dinner dates on skyscraper roofs and domesticity. But there was some part of me that was raging inside, begging to not sit down, not quite yet. But to do what? What could I do that could possibly justify throwing away something so  But then I have to remind myself that those cushy Upper East Side apartment days would’ve been laden with arguments, with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction as I look down at the rest of Manhattan and yearn for life abroad, yearn for an MBA, for something outside of the cage of glass walls. It’s been hard to keep that in mind, though. And that’s what I’ve been struggling with most. Pressure. Guilt. A need to surmount the alternate life I would have led. A need to prove myself to bystanders and watchers from afar. I think that’s one of the downsides of having such a public relationship; I now feel as though I’m being compared to my ex partner. That people are watching my moves to see just what is to come of me. (When in reality, I know that no one is probably doing this and all of this is self inflicted.) So, TLDR, these past two months have been hard, a kind of difficulty I’ve never had before. Because I haven’t broken down into tears or felt any heaviness or sadness. Instead, I feel a dull ache, a fear that I’ll never be known again in the way that I once was known. An exhaustion at the thought of having to reteach someone who I am. A dread at the realization that I could be learned by someone only to go through this all over again. I’ve been told that I think in future terms too much. That’s probably evident from the whole ‘had a plan since elementary school’ thing. The same goes for relationships. I’ve come to realize that I see them as investments, that I’m always wondering how this will play out in the long-term, in the future, what return I’ll get. And so I’m trying, really fucking trying, to live in this moment and to be grateful for the people I have in my life now. Push away the thoughts of “What happens on June 1?” and simply just enjoy their company that I have now. 31 days. That’s all I have left with some of these people. 31 days. So here I am, picking myself up off the path of self-destruction and self-sabotage. I don’t think this path is a bad one, though. I think it was something completely necessary. In this numbness, I’ve learned a lot about myself. In my relationship, I thought I had such a clear idea of who I was and who I wanted to be. I thought I was rid of all insecurities. But in my singledom, I’ve realized that this is, in fact, not the case. I still have so much to learn about myself, so much to understand and explore. I think ultimately the real big first step is learning how to forgive myself and be okay with the person I am. In these past two months, I think some shit has really happened and I’ve questioned my identity, my decisions, and my sense of self a  . But by doing this, I’ve been able to really give who I am a real hard look and realize that there are some things that need changing. And so hopefully I can continue evaluating and enacting that change.

on Tuesday, I turned 22. it wasn’t nearly as blissful as turning 21 because, well, there’s no milestone associated with this age (besides being able to play the Taylor Swift song). also, this was my last birthday where all my closest friends were at an arms length. going out to dinner with a group of 15 friends took just a handful of coordinating texts, and spontaneously gathering people to celebrate took walking 20 feet from my room. it’s weird to think that next year, my friends will be scattered around the world, and getting everyone in one place will involve significantly more effort. as the weeks of this semester have passed, I feel like I’ve been grappling more and more with the notion of leaving. so much is up in the air about my post-grad situation that it’s not something I’m looking forward to, especially when only two others in my close friend group are moving to New York City with me. there’s also the fact that I’ll be in Africa this summer; I’m interning in Cape Town through  MISTI recently, there’s been an ominous cast on everything in my surroundings that’s associated with moving out of Boston (potentially) forever. I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard people say “well, you’re leaving soon, anyways…,” nor can I quantify the anxiety it evokes. I did a “senior sale” to get rid of my belongings, which felt odd since I’ve collected so much in these past four years that I don’t want to part with. with no concept of summer storage anymore, I’ve been trying to time my use of things so that I don’t have anything left at the end of the year. it sucks. it also makes me feel like everything I do in these remaining weeks holds significance. I get stressed out if I’m not taking every opportunity to see my friends, or if I don’t have weekend plans, or if I have to miss an event I really wanted to go to. the fear of mis-optimizing is back in full force, but this time, it’s a race against the clock counting down to commencement. when I think about heart-wrenching it was to leave campus in March 2020, a mere seven months into my freshman year, it’s hard to conceptualize what saying goodbye will be like now, as a senior. my relationships have shifted a lot since then, but the bonds with my communities on campus have only gotten stronger. thinking about the inevitable frenzy of packing and saying goodbye that will happen after commencement almost makes me want to postpone getting my diploma. I worked hard to make it through this school, which is why I’m able to enjoy a (relatively) relaxing senior spring, but that just means I have more time to consider how important my relationships are to me, and how much I’ll miss them. the realization that we have two weeks left in the semester was absolutely chilling. normally, that fact strikes horror because it means I have to finish entire final projects, or cram for finals in classes I haven’t attended in weeks, but now it just signals the end. what do you   I won’t be a college student in a month, give or take? what do you   I have to say goodbye to my best friends, one of whom will be in Italy/Denmark/Taiwan for the next year? four years feels like nothing at all, but so much has happened. I’ve changed so much and learned so much. despite this, I don’t feel ready at all to enter the real world. I’m sure every single senior feels this way, but given how much time I spent drifting through school during the pandemic, I feel especially unprepared. part of me is satisfied with my college experience, and part of me has a lot of regret about the time I spent and the choices I made. I know I did the best I could in my circumstances, but damn. knowing I have so little time left, I’m wondering how I should spend it. which friends I should reach out to before I don’t see them again for months or even years, how I should prioritize things, etc, etc. I’m not really a bucket list person, but I feel like I need one for some sense of finality. shit’s scary…everything feels foreboding. I’m going to do my best to not have any regrets in this final stretch, but I know that’s going to be a near impossible feat. I just really,   wish I had more time.

Ask MIT students what they like about MIT, and many of them will say “the people”. What do we mean by this? I ask around. who are “the people at mit”? i think it’s mostly undergrads, people in related friend groups + orgs, etc. rather than the student body as a whole or grad students / workers / etc i promise you that if an undergrad student uses “the people” of mit, they are only referring to undergrad students, and maybe some well-liked faculty or non-teaching staff or young grad student friends, but not dining hall workers, nor maintenance workers, or PhD students. i don’t think this is necessarily a good thing but it would be insincere not to say this is somewhat true. I think what is meant by most individuals when they are asked the question of what they like about MIT and subsequently answer, “the people” is, “the people whom I consider my friends or tribe.” I think it’s dishonest to say that everyone at MIT likes everyone, but this doesn’t need to be true nor is MIT benefited from it potentially being true. What makes the people so good at MIT is that every person, whether they’re student, faculty, or staff, can make the choice to associate with whomever they want from the diverse strata of interests, personalities, and backgrounds that MIT offers. One can argue that the people as a whole at MIT are more willing to step outside their comfortable niches to associate with those different from themselves, but this trait is really only possible because there are so many different kinds of people here. i guess i would answer differently in theory because what i like is my personal community that i found. and yes i do think i could form this anywhere. but this one already existed, and now i’m part of it. probably similar to the way people feel comradery with others of their frat even if they haven’t met before. i don’t know. i wonder about this often too. the mit i knew before i arrived on campus was one composed through admissions blogs, quirky anecdotes, and urban legend (have you heard of the mit-harvard  pigeon pavlov hack there are no traits that are unique to MIT, but the extreme variety and blending of traits makes MIT really special i actually think most of the things we like about MIT people are true at most places, but because everyone thinks it’s an “MIT thing” it’s easier for us to notice this in other people + people are more open in some ways and more willing to foster community easily & everywhere. some people will say that MIT people are just super motivated & hard-working & passionate. maybe that’s true, but the people i enjoy are passionate about things that aren’t academic, and this happens everywhere. to the people that say “theyre not like people their age that like to get drunk every weekend” they have this adolescent fantasy that escaping their environment will vindicate a fledgling understanding of the world by othering actual humans based on their perceived intelligence usually by strawmaning people they are estranged to. but I dont doubt that people just like having a pool of similar enough peers that will at the very least be not that shitty via the admissions process. Especially escaping former hardship, the irony is that the former group just becomes bullies themselves. As a prefrosh “the people” was definitely part of my decision but as someone who’s about to graduate I don’t think MIT people are more worth being around than people from other schools. technically passionate respect for competence super smart and talented ofc. Raw talent I’d be referring to the way that people around me inspire me with how they’ve learned and done so much while being the same age as me. deeply curious curious, hold you intellectually accountable, new perspectives innovative, creative, weird, interdisciplinary, multidimensional i didn’t know smart came in so many shapes and colors until after meeting people here. maybe too much emphasis on intelligence over kindness in general. i’m not sure way too much emphasize on being smart + funny in conversations / social interactions. this shows up in conversations, mit confessions comments, piazza, etc. where you get people making snarky replies that are honestly pretty rude and wouldn’t be acceptable elsewhere but they get lots of upvotes or support because they’re smart and funny and stuff. i think it originates largely from kids here valuing intelligence and/or being insecure and wanting to demonstrate their intelligence when interacting with people the more time i spend here, the more i understand why our mascot is the beaver — everyone here is so incredibly hard-working and curious. after all, i’m typing this up past midnight in hayden and more than half the seats here are still occupied. like it or not, we got here by being tryhards, and we’ll continue trying hard. i like the fact that there’s this mentality to strive for the best, but at the same time, the spirit goes that collaboration beats competition. and so we pset together, we laugh together, we cry together — we learn together, and we grow up together. hardest working hardest playing people ive ever found have similar interest and personality like mine ( like board games/kpop/asian stuff(boba)), do homework ontime, hardworking and little partying. hardworking / motivated (compared to the avg person), have communities they’re involved in and care about Passionate about what they like/do How passionate everyone is about their niche and how open they are to sharing their passions. uniquely mit traits: go deep/intense on projects (+), too overwhelmed/busy to care about others (-) people don’t know how to commit to things and don’t understand signing up for too many things means doing all of them badly (after a certain point) and stressing other people out. i’ve started sending my friends  hell yeah or no people are much more focused on their work than on their friendships; some such people are very boring socially. intellectual masochism extremely passionate and motivated, most likely grinding on something they care a lot about, really internally motivated to do good and work hard Typically I mean that people here have this incredible tenacity for the things they do, meaning they will be hardworking, passionate, and talented in their academic pursuits, but also creative/social/sporty outlets. I think the people here are uniquely multifaceted. You’ll meet people who are simultaneously balancing killing the game and winning awards in research AND producing high quality art or being president or captain of whatever. They take their academics but also their leisure very seriously (see building rollercoasters), and very often take being your friend very seriously. If someone here loves you, they show up & support you with the same (if not more) effort they put into their other passions. tl;dr: of course people here don’t have totally unique characteristics, we’re just more hardcore about /everything/, including being really kind, lovely, creative people Obviously this is not true for everyone, but speaking generally, MIT people, compared to people I met at other universities, are more passionate about their interests and have a wider range of interests (both in any one person and across people as a whole) i feel like part of it might be hiveminding, but i do feel like (1) people do seem to care more about life enjoyment than The Future TM, and (2) the things people do for this life enjoyment are more varied and include less formal/more silly things Being unabashedly unafraid to have our own interests (no matter how quirky or mainstream they may be). The passion for these interests spark joy and shine brightly–despite the dark hellish academic pressure that mit classes can place on us in tandem with the hard struggles that can come with persevering through the other social/emotional aspects of college (#growingpains) I feel like MIT students are uniquely passionate about things and don’t really care if other people judge them for it. I think this is apparent by the plethora of relatively niche interest clubs will be interested in any niche topic you have to talk about MIT also has a lot of unique or really cool clubs that you don’t see everywhere, i.e.  spinning arts assassins guild esf model train ADT solar car everyone wants to talk to you, everyone has a passion that they love talking about. if I go to next house for example there will be upperclassmen who just talk to me about anything, ask about my day, are friendly, help out if you need. nobody is toxic or sabotaging well I’ve never been anywhere else for college so I don’t know, but I think being open about discussing interests. I’ll be talking to my friends and the next thing I know, my friend is explaining some advanced course 6 hardware stuff. At the end, I’ve learned a bit, and I can tell they’re really passionate about what they’re talking about. smaller proportion of people who do their major for career prospects or are otherwise very career-oriented people a place where the vast majority of people have very specific, borderline-obsessive, shameless, deep interests Feeling like we all share some kind of passion for academics, even if it’s not the same passion; I enjoy being able to grab dinner with a group of people and learn about a new topic from someone or have in-depth debates over random ideas common stem interests → easier to talk to / get to know we’re analyzing a film in literature and existentialism class, and someone brings up an analogy of people as a disarray of drifting particles. grins light up our faces as we eagerly dive into metaphysical physics metaphors — we see electric fields in sartre’s look, infinity in camus’ sisyphus, and recurring references to internships, psets, and ihtfp. we synthesize our technical terms into frameworks for parsing the world — and while anyone can throw around these amalgamations of science and philosophy, there has never been a world where you can easily feel so understood. people are here to do things to change the world and advance technology for the better, people are here to do research The administration, faculty, and staff give students a ton of freedom to do whatever they want (choose your dorm, 24/7 access to incredible machine shops, etc). This is especially amazing when combined with how skilled MIT students are. My friends, who happen to be robotics kids like me, helped me build a robot for fun (over several months). I don’t think that would’ve happened if I went to another university (my friends either wouldn’t have the skills and/or wouldn’t be willing to put in a ton of time for someone else’s passion project). The people here are super passionate about their projects and what they do. A lot of people take initiative to pursue these passions, and their finished results are very cool. The “Unique to MIT” part is that a lot of these projects largely involve makerspaces and like making something physically cool. i think that mit encourages creation. it is the mother of makerspaces, the home to hundreds of assorted student groups, the kind of place where people build motorcycles in their hall bathroom — but above all, it is a haven for the act of making things happen. and the people here, with their brilliant minds, will take this call to action to heart and work miracles. that is, when we’re not drowning in psets and the infinite grind of one week syllabus, two weeks class, ten weeks midterms, two weeks finals. there is just so much potential walking around mit, but at the same time, we often lose those projects to the minutes that slip through our fingers. and yet that is the puzzle of mit — to be at an epicenter of innovation, and know that what we make of it is exactly what we make out of it. so we struggle onwards, boats borne back ceaselessly, but it is in this shared struggle that we understand each other. you say ihtfp and i like that i know exactly what you mean. mit is special because if you want to build a rollercoaster, you  , as long as you get permission to use a space, make sure you build it up to code, and follow all the relevant osha regulations. most places just wouldn’t trust you with that kind of responsibility and wouldn’t give you a space at all. creative people are everywhere, but they shine a lot brighter when they’re in a place where they’re allowed to express themselves. people are genuinely encouraging and non competitive. Collaborative. This is vaguely my tour guide stock answer, but i do also believe it. Mostly bc people keep asking me if it’s like [insert ivy-like college here] where everyone’s competing for A’s all the time and i get to say no, actually, people are generally willing to Help with classwork and such. It’s not fully unique, but it does set us apart from a few specific colleges l o l collaboration rather than competitiveness (usually) MIT students, despite the nature of the school, are not cut throat or competitive with others, rather everyone is focused on bettering themselves and achieving their goals. the culture of (legal) pset collaboration and acceptance of the struggleTM is passed down from generations of upperclassmen to lowerclassmen and encouraged by teaching staffs foster good vibes<3 I think really strong pset groups – I don’t think this is normal elsewhere? Having a group you can work together with and making sure everyone succeeds, not just competing against each other. people at MIT are very collaborative and supportive (as opposed to competitive). Upperclassmen will spend hours teaching me how to use the HASS or TIG weld or do FEA. Legendary alumni come to help out at events and give really good advice and talks. The way that everyone here wants each other to succeed. There’s no competition of “I have to be the best, so you have to fail” or anything like that. Everyone wants everyone else to succeed, together. I think that collaborative attitude is pretty central to the MIT experience and identity, in a way that’s pretty unique. welcoming and supportive, making time for others if you’re struggling in a class, the people who help you out are never pretentious about it, and if you’re helping someone who’s struggling you do everything in your power to help them understand. we care about eachother in deep, familial ways. more willing to help others who are struggling (Specific) People’s faces pop up in my head, and I think of how they were by my side, or how we were together, during specifically wonderful or terrible events – some things as small as failing a test or going out to boba on a sunny day, and as big as figuring out family emergencies or winning some award or getting some offer. In addition (and in a more convoluted way) – I think of the people with whom I have formed such a wonderful bond with that I will be willingly next to their side during hardships almost unconditionally. I don’t think this is completely unique to MIT. people are always there for you whenever you need help, people are there to listen to you rant, people are here to collaborate with you the people know a lot and are very willing to teach you what they know Whatever it is you want to do at MIT, there’s someone here who will help you do it. Whether you want to loft your bed, build a startup, or just like, pass your classes, it’s almost guaranteed that the people around you will help you achieve that goal. i think something uniquely mit is the imposter syndrome that comes with the name, so my friends and i all think we just kinda lucked out on getting in and have been struggling ever since mit people are genuine — no  duck syndrome One thing I do thing is uniquely MIT is being open about how were all struggling. I’ve heard about Stanford ducks, where they’re paddling and paddling to just try to make it seem like they’re just gliding along. Here we’re pretty open about how were doing, with one group I’m in giving everyone two free mental health days to use at any point in the semester. If you use one, people may reach out to make sure you’re okay, but no one judges you for it. MIT is hard and we’re all struggling together,. This is why I like that MIT has no honors, no cum laude. It’s just your degree, and we’ll all get the same degree. You may have two minors and two majors while I have just one major, but we’re still getting the same degree with no extra distinctions. The people here are very chill and fun to talk to. There is a sense of transparency as no one really pretends to have their whole life together, and I think this makes it easier to talk to people compared to people at other colleges. we were all stupid enough to go here One other trait of MIT that I don’t think we normally get from other universities is how up front and genuine people are. With a few exceptions, people in general say what they mean. This is not necessarily always a great thing (some people do lack social skills and that does contribute to some disutility), but I’m not so constantly worrying that people are plotting something against me behind my back, like I had to in middle school. they’re kinda weird but in a good way quirky and eccentric, or accepting of others’ quirks and eccentricities People here aren’t afraid to be nerdy, and as a fellow nerd, this is cool. I’ve heard that MIT is unique in its vibrant but nerdy community;  dormspam quirkiness, niche communities, strong identities as members of student groups and living groups larger proportion of non-heteronormative or ND people I mean this respectfully and this is backed up by data and I self identify like this: the people at mit are often hyperfixators, who can easily find something to obsess over and delve into that for hours. I think that’s one of the things that makes MIT so special. I think without that touch of neurodivergent compulsion to obsess over things there wouldn’t be as much passion and our extracurricular wouldn’t be so special conversations that can flip at a moment’s notice between thought-provoking/intellectual and completely idiotic way more people here than average are interesting — genuine, true to themselves, quirky, kind of weird in a good way we speak in numbers, i like to tell the tour groups. “tell an mit student that to meet them at 3 in building 3 for 3.003 in course 3, and they’ll know that means to meet them at 3 pm in the maclaurin buildings for principles of engineering practice in the materials science major.” and of course that isn’t true for most mass techers, at least not fully — but sit around in a lounge, walk the infinite, or wander through a library and you’ll hear all these numbers that our minds automatically translate. these shared simulacrums are not what make us mit students, or what brings us here, but during our time together they bind us with a strange colloquial power. “you taught me a secret language / i can’t share with anyone else,” taylor sings. pasta two things that come to mind recently are “We appreciate having a 21 year old milk at Random” or “We fill  Hayden People here aren’t afraid to be nerdy, and as a fellow nerd, this is cool. I’ve heard that MIT is unique in its vibrant but nerdy community; dormspam is something unique to MIT and kinda creates a sense of a united campus. It’s pretty easy to guess, but I’m autistic. I’ve been told by multiple MIT students and faculty that for whatever reason, there’s a somewhat higher-than-average neurodivergent population at MIT than in the wider world. Judging by the people here, I’d totally buy that, and I’ve found more acceptance and belonging here because of that than I would have elsewhere. I truly have found my “people.” When I say “the people” I mean east side culture. As a queer neurodivergent person, being in a place where people are unopologetically neurodivergent and queer is amazing. It feels so great to unmask and be myself without others thinking I’m weird. MIT people are people I see myself in. Sure, by coming to MIT, I have surrounded myself with people who share my ambition. But even more than that, in the presence of “MIT people” I find solidarity and acceptance from those who are just like me (and from plenty of people here who aren’t like me, but who accept me just the same). I’ve found friends here who accept that sometimes I need breaks from sensory-intensive situations, and understand that I occasionally can’t put my thoughts into words. Even something as small as geeking out over a super specific and niche interest makes me feel like I truly belong here. Also meeting people who are super similar to me, which is not common at all in places outside of MIT (similar in terms of academic interests, tendency for spontaneity, and open-mindedness). I don’t know if this is true for everyone, but I found it much easier to get along with people here than I did with people in high school. This might have been fostered by a culture of collaboration instead of competition, but people don’t seem to be out to get you as much as people were in high school. There are a wider variety of people, so I am able to find many different outlets to express many different aspects of myself. maybe it’s just hard for me to get along with “normal people” (sampled uniformly from usa, eg. my high school) so i appreciate being able to get along with a lot of people here generally easy to talk to, non-judgemental, and always have something new or interesting to share most people (that i like) are down to hang out ~the vibe~ the majority of people are so chill and so humble. you’re playing slap cup at a party, and then get into a conversation with their person next to you and find out that they’re some national champion in something, and you’d never know it. (Most) MIT students are very humble and helpful despite how awe-inspiring they are and the amazing things they have done. we respect each other and recognize that everyone has something worthwhile to contribute: we take things seriously and never try to build ourselves up by putting other people down. we all recognize that there’s someone out there who’s smarter than us when i talk about the people, i think what i’m really talking about is the way mit culture really encourages people to  . i think a lot of other colleges tend to stifle social freedom and expression because they’re scared of liability and backlash, which creates a very restrained culture. mit’s culture encourages people to be themselves, be loud and proud, express themselves and enjoy life, all that jazz. like the old stereotypes about liberal arts colleges, funnily enough. i think this kind of culture is very self-reinforcing, because it attracts other unique, creative people who want to be able to express themselves too. i think this kind of culture is the natural state of human beings, especially college kids who are growing up and creating their identities for the first time, and the only reason it doesn’t exist everywhere is that there are people in power who intentionally suppress it. inhibited, droning normalcy is boring, safe, and makes sure an institution has less legal liability. more kind to outsiders and accepting of differences there seems to be very little barrier to interactions or social circles between years and departments/courses (i.e., social interaction is not entirely academics-driven) orgs that i really like being a part of include  ohms lsc web.lab esp poker club hmmt to me, the people at MIT are very willing. i wouldn’t say inherently more creative or more nice than people elsewhere. something i appreciate about MIT is when i have a thought that feels silly or strange, one i might not voice at other places for fear of being called nerdy or eccentric, i can say it here and people actually think it through and respond to it. there is a willingness to engage with odd, out there, weird ideas we’re lying on the carpet at 5 am, the weight of the world slipping out our lips and into the night. someone plays a taylor swift song and semi-strangers stop by to sing along. a sheesh scurries along, but no one really bats an eye. there is comfort here. the way we interact – many of us come from backgrounds where you are the only one in the room who would understand a nerdy joke, or think about certain deep topics, etc,. At MIT, I have felt (mostly) utmost comfort to talk about those things to at least a few people, and that is a part of what makes MIT so special for me.

A credit card is something I, in theory, knew I needed  . Apparently a credit score is a thing that people care about here. The thing is, for the longest time, I thought the idea of “building credit” was ridiculous. The going advice is that you shouldn’t go over 30% of your credit limit, and that you should pay it off when you can. This kind of all goes with the assumption that you should only use your credit card for things you can pay already pay for. Which is ridiculous, because then you could pay for it directly instead of using a credit card. One reason to get a credit card, then, is to get something called a credit score, which is a number related to your credit history, which is something that people like landlords care about. I knew all this, in theory. I’ve known for a few months now that, once I graduated, I’d move to New York and would have to find an apartment there. Yet I didn’t think about needing a credit score up until a few weeks ago, which was when I applied for my first credit card. That’s when I learned that some credit score formulas required a few months of activity before they started existing. Oops. My grand unified theory of adulting is that it’s thinking about things that aren’t problems yet, but will become problems if ignored. Like having a credit card, which leads to a credit score, which leads to getting an apartment. Or going to the dentist every few months. Or buying new shoes to replace the shoes that have growing holes in them. Or health insurance, or taxes, or feeding yourself, or Roth IRAs. My holey shoes aren’t a problem now, but they might be in a few days, or weeks, or months. I can delay apartment hunting, but I have to do it eventually. In my blogger app, one blog prompt I answered was “When was the first time you felt like a grown up?” My list of things that made me feel grown up included: renting a room, buying a mattress, flying alone, applying for a visa, job hunting. At the time, my thought was: I know it’s wrong, but I see growing up as things that are defined by the things I do  . I see growing up less of dealing with problems, and more of having to worry about these kinds of problems in the first place. That growing up is this thing that’s inherently alone and full of problems, and my choice was either staying immature forever or become an adult. Many of the “grown up problems” I listed happened because I started living alone, because these were things other people used to worry about. I didn’t have to worry about furniture, because my parents used to worry about that for me. I guess that’s why I associated these adulting things with being alone. In a follow-up post I made a month later, I wrote: Grown up. The MIT blog prompt asks;   and now that I think about it I kind of don’t want to be a grown up. Let me be a child and let me enjoy speeding down a ramp on a rolling chair, let me lie down on the carpet to stare at the dome, let me roll around in the grass and make a mess and play games. I didn’t have many adult role models growing up, so for a while my idea of being a grown up was tied to my parents, who were kinda humorless. You couldn’t have these adult problems and be a fun person to be around, or at least, that’s what I thought. Four years of hindsight later, I don’t think adulting has to be something you do alone, or that growing up means becoming unadventurous. It’s about taking initiative to act on things that aren’t quite problems yet. I confused taking initiative for being alone. You have to act on your problems first, because other people probably aren’t going to bring them up, but you don’t have to act alone. And I confused thinking ahead for being unfun. You can deal with your problems before they become bigger, but you don’t have to worry about your problems all the time. Sometimes I’ve made mistakes, but that doesn’t mean I’m a bad adult, whatever that’s supposed to mean. My credit history is too short, but that only means I need to ask for help when apartment hunting this summer.

I first arrived at MIT as a tourist, a thirteen-year-old with glasses that didn’t flatter my face and blunt bangs I cut myself. It was spring break of eighth grade, and my family was on a vacation visiting the East Coast—of course, as was typical for my academically-serious parents, such a trip had to include visits to prestigious college campuses. It’s been a decade, and only brief snippets of that MIT still remain in my memory. Walls papered with activities posters, that’s the main image I recall. I suppose some things don’t change. Throughout high school, I would visit MIT several more times for the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament and Math Prize for Girls. It would be easy to editorialize, to imbue these experiences with the overbearing hand of hindsight, to claim that these events were all stepping stones to an inevitable destiny where I would be writing this blog post to you. But that isn’t how life works, right? It would be just as simple to tell a story about any other number of colleges, had I decided to attend those instead. Here’s a secret: MIT wasn’t my top choice. My top choice was Stanford, which I was not admitted to. And if I hadn’t chosen MIT, I probably would have chosen the University of Pennsylvania, which had recruited me for their creative writing program. I adore MIT now, and I always say that I’m so glad I came here, that it was absolutely the correct decision. But who knows? Maybe I would be saying that too if I had gone to Stanford, or UPenn, or anywhere else. Truthfully, I started college when I was young and impressionable, and wherever I had attended would’ve irrevocably changed me. Was MIT perfect for me, or did I become someone who was perfect for MIT? And honestly, does the distinction even matter? When I was in my late teens, people would ask,  I wasn’t quite sure of the answer myself, so I would respond with some lifted-from-the-admissions-brochure sentence about how MIT has a stellar humanities program (which, by the way, it does) or a vague gesture at my interests in mathematics. But I’m not a teenager anymore, and I don’t feel any need to defend myself. If I think back to the decision I made as a high school senior, it seems obvious, and I’m sure I would make the same decision again. I was the rare person who didn’t love Campus Preview Weekend, MIT’s famously extravagant and wild weekend for admitted students. I found the schedule demanding and confusing; I didn’t know anybody else who had gotten into MIT and struggled to meet other kids. In contrast, UPenn’s visiting session felt much more normal and easy to understand. But I suspect, deep down, during that entire stretch of April, I always knew I was going to choose MIT. Bluntly put, it was the most selective school I was admitted to, and I was a stressed-out seventeen-year-old, so of course that social perception mattered to me. From speaking to UPenn students, it also sounded like UPenn’s mathematics and computer science programs were not as strong (please note that I  commenting on the actual rigor or quality of these departments, this is simply what I heard from the kids there), and while I liked the humanities a lot and knew UPenn’s creative writing program was incredible, I had some inkling of the job prospects (or lack thereof) for an English major. And if I was going to study STEM, well, MIT it was. When I was younger, I didn’t know how to confess these reasons, because they seemed so shallow.  And even now, while I think those are important considerations, I certainly hope I wouldn’t carry out the rest of my career in the same manner. I want to work at moonshot start-ups doing exciting stuff, even if they don’t look as shiny on my LinkedIn as McKinsey or Google or Jane Street would, and they don’t offer the financial stability of an established company. But even though my reasons for choosing MIT were probably not that deep or thoughtful, they still led me to the right place. It turns out that those reasons were decent signals for what actually matters. Like, I went here because I wanted others to think I was smart for going here, but hey,  , and thus I’m fortunate to have befriended so many amazing, brilliant people. Petey  suggests want to become the “stereotypical MIT alum”: that is, an engineer without interests in the wider world, working a cushy job at a big company. Of course, the truth is that MIT has  alumni—each graduating class is over a thousand people—that it isn’t easy to generalize, and my perception of an “MIT alum” was rooted in broad, unflattering strokes colored by teen angst. It only struck me much later that I may be different, but that means I could be a different type of MIT alum. I could be someone that incoming MIT first-years could look at and say,  . MIT’s identity is ever-shifting; while I was only thinking about how it might change  , I failed to consider how I could change MIT, too. here

Exactly one year ago today, Jebby  blogged Course 6-4: Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making interdisciplinary major Civil and Environmental Engineering Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences Course 1-12: Climate System Science and Engineering According to  its website Climate change is the most pressing global challenge of our time. Solutions for mitigating and adapting to climate change require an understanding of both the Earth system and engineering applications—as well as an understanding of human and institutional behavior. Many of the best jobs held by leaders in the field, will combine scientific understanding of the earth’s systems with engineering skills. The Course 1-12 Climate System Science and Engineering degree program, jointly offered by the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), prepares students to become leaders, helping to accelerate high-impact, science-based solutions to aid the global response to climate change. As industries and governments increase resources devoted to tackling the world’s most difficult problem, an expanding set of exciting career opportunities are emerging in climate science and engineering and this trend will likely continue over the coming decades. : * The foundational science of climate change 
* Engineering to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate impacts of a changing climate 
* How to model and analyze complex climate and environmental phenomena 
* How to analyze large and diverse datasets to produce reliable predictions 
* How to quantify the societal impact of climate risk and influence policy solutions for mitigation and adaptation In a  3Q series from MIT News

My friends and I met at noon on the Harvard Bridge, shoulders hunched against the cold. Two of the group had work or meetings so it was just three of us this misty Monday. We started across the bridge, seeking a gathering in Allston. I’m at Life Alive in Cambridge now, writing this, while beside me a student from another college has a massive book open beside her laptop. Two families with small kids order at the register. Every few minutes, a shadow crosses the window, cast by a pedestrian or two walking by on the street.  We meandered down Beacon Street and stopped to watch the marathon. The track was lined with cheering families and friends. The runners were going about the pace I’d shoot for in a three-mile race.  We wandered on, past college kids and people in
 
rain jackets. ⁠ 01 the two weren’t mutually exclusive but it appeared that more people over 25 check the weather We went from that house to another, which had a backyard near some train tracks, where I’d been once before, my freshman summer. I was thinking then about sororities, the only MIT communities I’d seen so far, and how I could join one — I wouldn’t fit in entirely, but I liked their gatherings, in a different backyard beside the train tracks. I’ve never joined a sorority, but I’ve watched as several of my friends did, and decided whether they did or didn’t fit in. Some did, and they love it. This would have been my final CPW, had I not taken a gap year. I keep thinking of what I had planned, though those plans were all nebulous, and involved a lot more scurrying off to work on my own than has ever
 
happened. ⁠ 02 I make efforts to not work alone now. Most evenings I’m surrounded by classmates I spent a good portion of time trying to find the perfect group that could fulfill all of me. Lately, though, I’ve come to realize that my different communities serve different parts of me. Some friends love going out; others hang out in my dorm. Most everyone will listen to me describe the projects I’m working on but some will have a mechanical project of their own to bring up, too.  Some will go to protests with me, and my little sister will inspire me to go to more. I’ve found outlets for my writing at Harvard, and in a few friendships at MIT. I find house concerts in Allston, often populated by Berklee bands, and meet new people with cool fashion between sets. I love meeting new people. Getting enough sleep this semester reminded me of that. My friends and I wandered away from Allston and eventually wound up at an MIT frat’s barbecue, where I met new people who were at most one connection away, a friend of a friend, if we hadn’t shared a class or been to the same club or event. I’ve had this sort of encounter more and more as time passes, and the MIT community, with so many social pockets, feels closer. I caught up with more people — a current classmate, a former one, a senior in my living group I think is super cool — and got my fourth and final burger of the long CPW weekend. It’s fun just wandering amidst a crowd on the street, sharing in its energy, and talking to strangers you will probably never meet again. But it’s also cool meeting new MIT people who are in overlapping circles. I was thinking of all the communities at MIT: how I’ve grown close to some and hover on the fringes of others, and how there are always more to connect to. I remember years ago feeling a sort of nostalgia for what never was. How sad that I couldn’t get to know deeply all the cities that I passed through, that I’d see the surface of so many icebergs of people and places without knowing the depths beneath. I’d meet travellers in hostels and think,  we could be friends;  and maybe we could, if they weren’t flying to another country tomorrow. Now I meet people in courtyards and free food events and loud, dark rooms, exchange majors and living groups and how hosed both of us are. Sometimes I think,  we should be friends.  And sometimes we  are , if one or the other of us isn’t too exhausted, too swept up in psets, too busy maintaining the relationships they have in the chaos of MIT to make room for another. Frequently it takes time, spacing out hangouts amidst the firehose of our lives. Often it takes luck, like being in the same class or walking the same route through the infinite; and dedication, choosing to stop and catch up for a few minutes in the middle of the day.  My friends and I said our goodbyes to the barbecue and meandered back across the bridge. The mist had set in since the morning; I could barely make out the lights on dorm row. Our shoulders hunched against the cold. We met each other through living on Beast in EC, but we maintain the friendship by pillaging free food events together, psetting late nights, and hanging out every weekend. We carve out time from our busy Monday schedules to cross the bridge in the middle of the day and wander the streets of Boston.

this weekend was a hectic one for my living group.
 DTYD ⁠ 01 dance til you drop, an annual party hosted by my floor, Burton 3rd 
the Muddy ⁠ 02 the pub that for some reason exists in Walker Memorial, right next to East Campus on Friday, I finished a pset, got lunch with a friend in Somerville, and then went back to my dorm for my floor’s first CPW event, “Deep Talks With Shallow People.” the event is hard to describe, but involves hockey sticks, chanting, and strange content scavenged from the depths of Reddit. it was the event that convinced me to join the floor, so I’ve ran it every CPW and REX since since
 
SCUFFY ⁠ 03 the first year residential exploration process was different in 2020, and was called SCUFFY  too many, so I tapped out for this CPW, leaving it to a ’25 and ’26 who felt similarly impacted by the nature of the event. they did an incredible job, and it was great to be able to spectate and see the content with fresh eyes. I think most of the prefrosh were pretty engaged, too. after, we had a couple of hours to hang around before leaving for our alumni bar crawl. this year, it was down the Orange Line and had six blissful stops from the North End down to Chinatown. more and more alumni joined as we went, and hanging out with them took me back to all the good times I had with them freshman year. it was insanely fun. on Saturday, I didn’t have any time to help with CPW events since I had to head to
 
Kresge ⁠ 04 the main auditorium on campus 
tech time ⁠ 05 the time each performer gets to stage + run through their performance 
didn’t cheer for us ⁠ 06 seriously y'all, hyping up performers is essential. nothing kills the vibe more than a dead audience as soon as we got off stage, the team commenced operation Get People Ready For Formal. DTYD formal was 6-9, and since Bhangra performed at 7:15, we were quite late. it didn’t help that Bhangra costumes are complex and take at least 15 minutes to put on fully. thankfully, me and the two others going to the event were undressed in mere seconds by the rest of the team, which made me feel like some sort of Victorian duchess. thanks to everyone’s help, I could change into my dress and heels and Uber to the venue within minutes of performing. slay! although the formal venue had its quirks, I had a great time. when it ended, we all headed back to Burton Conner to change and then went out with the alumni again. everyone was exhausted after, but still managed to stay up past 4 AM talking in the hallway. it reminded me of freshman year so much that I didn’t want to break away to go to bed. I’m really grateful the alumni cared enough to come back; it made me so happy to hang out with them in Burton Conner since the pandemic and renovation only gave me a few months to do so. something as simple as a “hallway party,” aka a bunch of people hanging out in the hallway in front of the elevator, made me emotional. after enduring so much chaos with the Burton Conner renovations and undergoing immense pressure to sustain the community, seeing new and old members of the floor casually interact felt amazing. at 5:30 AM, I summoned the courage to go to bed, but had to wake up before noon to work on “hockey awards” for the underclassmen. this tradition involves giving every non-senior a funny award for something they’re known for doing. for example, I got the “town crier award” last year since I was notorious for spilling tea. oops… this year’s hack, courtesy of the freshmen gathering the seniors to work on hockey awards felt surreal. three years ago, I was receiving an award for the first time, and in what felt like a blink of an eye, I was in charge of making them? something about that felt so wrong. given our past three years of work for the floor, hockey awards are technically the only contribution seniors have to make to DTYD, but it didn’t quite make sense to me. last year, I was one of the people responsible for running the entire party, and now I was just sitting around while the underclassmen blew up hundreds of balloons and hauled around subwoofers. four hours of ideation later, it was time for the ceremony, which was well-received. after, the freshmen presented senior superlatives they made for us, which were hilarious. obviously, the seniors aren’t as close to the ’26s as the younger classes, so the information they find out about us is comically distilled down to its essence. on a more bittersweet note, the presentation ended with a dedication to the entire class of 2023. since we’re the ones who made it from the old Burton Conner through the pandemic and renovation, the freshmen thanked us for all the work we did in preserving the community and its traditions. it felt disconcerting to be acknowledged for sustaining a community, but god, was it a lot of work. from virtual first-year placement in 2020, to REX
 
without a dorm ⁠ 07 burton conner rex in 2021 was held all over campus since the dorm was still offline for renovations 
FLEX, ⁠ 08 first-year floor exploration  to find the 58 wonderful members of the floor we currently have. it took a lot of energy and dedication to keep things going even amidst such uncertainty, but it certainly paid off, and I couldn’t help but tear up as everyone clapped for the 2023s. dtyd decor ! by some miracle, I managed to recover emotionally before DTYD began. we took huge group pictures and the live band launched into their set, which slapped, especially considering that we randomly found them on a job board just a few weeks ago. the rest of the party was great too—it went way better than I expected. I had reservations about numbers since last year it was held in a weird location, and in 2020 and 2021 it didn’t happen because of COVID. it was packed, though. I woke up at 2 pm the next day and sauntered down to the alumni barbecue (which wasn’t really a barbecue since it was raining). I had a much more calm Marathon Monday than most people since I just slept for the rest of the day. no regrets, though, as it was very necessary. and that was that. it’s weird that DTYD is over; I feel like it was the last huge landmark of the semester besides graduation, and since I haven’t yet rationalized the fact that I’m leaving, I feel anxious and sad. it’s reassuring that I can come back for alumni events, but it also feels like there’s a huge barrier to doing so, so there’s a clear sense of finality. the realization that I’m   makes me miss previous years, when I didn’t feel like I have one foot out the door, when CPW and meeting incoming students was exciting and not unsettling, when I was in charge of things rather than being free from all responsibility. while this has been one of the easiest semesters academically, and I’ve finally been able to make time for things I enjoy, I can’t help but miss the security that comes with not being on my way out. this weekend was a powerful reminder of why I love my community so much, so it only makes sense that I’m struggling to reconcile with the fact that I’m graduating soon. I imagine these feelings will only get worse over the next weeks, which I’m not excited for. regardless, this DTYD was one for the books. I’m sure it won’t be my last, but where I’ll be the next time around, I have absolutely no clue.

My friend Eric recently wrote  a blog post about isolation at Harvard At MIT, while these people certainly exist in droves—McKinsey information sessions are packed full, pre-professional clubs proliferate like dandelions—I’ve found it reasonably simple to avoid them and befriend people who express intellectual curiosity and genuine passion. To be fair, MIT may have cultivated a different culture than these other institutions, so this might be much easier for me than those at other schools, but here are some of the approaches I’ve developed from my time in college: My sophomore year here, I joined a business club because I was interested in entrepreneurship and had some vague inclinations towards consulting—I liked the idea of using my entire skill set instead of choosing between STEM and humanities. The meetings were boring, I didn’t particularly click with anybody there, and I realized that if I actually pursued a career in this direction, I would have to continue going to boring meetings surrounded by similar people. Sorry, maybe that’s harsh, and it’s obviously a generalization, but the realization was enough to turn me off from these type of clubs and this entire flavor of career. I’m still on the mailing lists for various computer science groups because I want the job opportunities (and free food), but I don’t try to get involved with them at any deeper level. While I’m sure these clubs appeal to a large variety of people—it’s possible to want to cultivate your professional prospects while still being genuinely passionate about computer science, after all—they certainly attract careerists, and I’d like to avoid careerists. Or, as Eric put it, “These organizations do nothing except act as vessels to sell [college] student resumes to company sponsors for thousands of dollars, then disburse that money on free food and branded merchandise for members.” Last month, I was trying to decide between taking 18.03 (Differential Equations) and 18.032 (also Differential Equations, but with a more mathematical and theoretical flavor). My friend was taking 18.03, while I knew nobody in 18.032. Due to a mandatory recitation for another class, I would have to skip 18.032 recitations, while I could attend 18.03 recitations. And did I  want to grind during senior spring, especially when I was also taking four other classes? There were multiple reasons why I decided on 18.032. I dislike  black-boxes But the  of 18.032 was just different. 18.03 is in 10-250, one of MIT’s big lecture halls, and has hundreds of students. It’s required in multiple majors, and lots of people are there to check it off the list. My other friend told me “nobody takes 18.03 seriously.” Meanwhile, 18.032 has about twenty people. The kids in the classroom seemed to care much more about math. That made sense, I suppose—they had voluntarily signed up for what was considered a more challenging course. So I stayed, because I wanted to be around people like that. At MIT, even before I got my book deal, many other writers would reach out to me, because they knew I liked writing a lot. I met a lot of my favorite people this way—like Michelle, who asked me to contribute to her science writing magazine, and is now pursuing a physics PhD, or Steven, who got a creative writing master’s degree in England and is now enrolled in an MD-PhD program. To be a creative writer at MIT, there’s a certain amount of going-against-the-grain required—a decision to sacrifice time and effort that could’ve been put towards your “real” career in STEM, to instead write. I was writing because it is something so deeply rooted in me that I couldn’t help but love it, but it became a fantastic way to attract likeminded people. (As an aside, I think the meeting-cool-writers filter became less effective after I got the book deal, because suddenly there was social status attached to writing, and there were more people with ulterior motives trying to establish some connection with me.) More generally, I don’t try to hide my interests out of fear of appearing uncool or something. That might sound ridiculous—we aren’t in high school anymore, after all—but even at MIT, people say I’m a nerd for caring so much about learning certain topics outside of class. Last week, my friend Wenjun and I started discussing continental drift because we have a shared interest in ancient Earth, despite being math and computer science majors, and somebody else asked, “Is this for a class or something?” He seemed confused why we wanted to talk about this when none of us were studying geology. The way I figure it, if I’m open about what I care about, it’ll be a lot easier to meet people who care about the same things as me, and that’s worth looking uncool. “Masks” by Shel Silverstein This one is specifically for women and anyone else who might’ve been a minority within their interests (which I imagine is true for a lot of the STEM women out there). But as I tried pursuing my passions in computer science and mathematics beyond just taking classes, I noticed I was often the only woman there. This might’ve started as early as middle school, when I joined Science Bowl and was one of two girls there out of about fifteen kids—I was captain of our B-team, and the rest of that team was boys older than me, and the only reason why it felt fine to lead them is probably because I was too young and oblivious to think there was any issue with the gender disparity. More recently, during my summer math research project, I was the only woman in my group and one of four women (out of sixty-ish people) in the program. In March, I tried going to a SIPB hackathon (the student club at MIT that makes cool stuff like our course scheduler) because I like building websites and wanted to help out, and I was the only woman there out of twenty-five or thirty people. By the way, all of these observations are made with the caveat that I was the only woman that I knew of, since I may be unaware of other people’s gender identities. It’s sometimes hard to be the only woman in the room and I would love there to be more gender diversity within my interests. I also don’t blame anyone who can’t handle the isolation and otherness, and thus does not engage deeper with their interests. A lot of my confidence has come with age and being able to not care if guys ignore me, or condescend to me, or hit on me, but this was more difficult when I was younger. I don’t know if this advice will work for anyone besides myself. There are many other traits and aspects I haven’t mentioned—I would consider myself to be outgoing, which certainly helps with meeting people—and again, I go to MIT. Friends who attend other prestigious institutions have had vastly different experiences, which makes sense, as I’d imagine that people who choose to attend elite schools probably prioritize professional development, economic and social capital, etc., and those priorities often squash one’s natural curiosity. Overall, my belief is that like attract likes—the best way to find curious people is to be curious yourself. But of course, if you’re reading this blog post, you probably already knew that. here

Prologue “Guess what, gang?” Fred Harris – the director of the MIT Wind Ensemble (MITWE) – announced one day during our regular Wednesday rehearsal, “We’re going to Brazil!” Suddenly, samba music began blasting from a dozen speakers hidden around Kresge auditorium while the stage transformed into an impromptu dance floor. That Friday, we performed in the famous  Teatro Amazonas  in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. How it went down in my head. … well, maybe that’s not exactly how it all happened, but it sure felt that way. The whole experience was so incredible that I still can’t quite comprehend how it was all orchestrated (pun intended). It all started in my first-year fall semester when we performed our first  Hearing Amazônia  concert. It was a massive three-way collaboration between MITWE, the Festival Jazz Ensemble (FJE), and the Vocal Jazz Ensemble (VJE), starring seven(!) guest artists and three guest speakers. At the time, I thought it would be a one-time event because of the sheer scale and effort of coordinating it all. Plus, I was unaware of any connection between MITWE and Brazil, so I assumed we performed Brazilian music
 
because it sounded fresh and funky ⁠ 01 It really does Little did I know that the concert (and many more future events) were already in the works for several years. In fact, the trip to Brazil would likely have happened in 2020 if COVID hadn’t appeared and disrupted everything. Thanks to Fred’s commitment to environmentalism and music education, he moved heaven and earth behind the scenes to forge a meaningful connection between MIT and communities in the Amazon rainforest. For the rest of my first year, references to Brazil were scattered across our rehearsals and performances. At the end of that fall semester, we read through a set of traditional Brazilian music arranged for the wind ensemble by some Swiss music students; the following spring, we performed those pieces in a concert. Finally, in my second-year fall semester, the big announcement was made – we were going on an all-expenses-paid trip to Brazil to learn about their local music and perform in a concert! Day 1 Fast forward to about three weeks ago, and we’ve arrived in Manaus – a Brazilian city in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. What a way to start my spring break! Immediately upon landing, I could tell that Manaus was a very cool place (but not literally – it was
 
30°C ⁠ 02 86°F I had very little bandwidth to marvel at this phenomenon because I’d failed to get enough sleep (and food) on the two flights it took to get to Manaus, but lunch was awaiting us at the hotel when we arrived. Check out these extra long pineapples. I thoroughly enjoyed eating Brazilian food. The cheese bread and filet mignon (which was somehow available at almost every meal) were superb, and the pineapples in MIT dining halls wouldn’t be as sweet as the Brazilian ones, even if I dumped a spoonful of sugar onto them. After trying (fruitlessly) to nap, I went to a nearby supermarket with a few other MITWE members to buy bottled water (since we were advised not to drink the tap water). We also decided to try some local ice cream flavours there – an excellent decision for everyone except one of the percussionists, who accidentally bought a giant block of plain ice instead. For dinner, we went to  Luar de Uaicurapá  – a nightclub-esque restaurant famous for live  Boi-Bumbá  music. Unfortunately, some wires must’ve crossed somewhere because the restaurant ran out of food for us, so we had to return to the hotel two hours earlier than planned. (But at least that meant I could sleep longer that night.) Fred picture of the day. Day 2 An x-caboquinho. At breakfast, I was greeted by yet more delicious Brazilian food – tapioca crepes, locally-made cheese, and a peculiar sandwich named “x-caboquinho”, made using  fruit  with the texture of dried mango and the taste of avocado. (It was also during breakfast when I learned that the letter “x” is pronounced “cheese” in Portuguese.) The day’s main activity was visiting the São Sebastião community (an indigenous community that I think works with MIT). To get there, we took a boat ride up the Rio Negro – one of the two rivers that run through Manaus. At the community, the locals welcomed us with open arms and performed some dances they’d prepared for us. We then learned about their robotics projects for protecting the rainforest, from building rafts for measuring river pH levels to teaching kids how to fly drones to identify illegal deforestation. Most of those projects were possible thanks to the  Nobre Academia De Robótica  – a local startup aiming to help indigenous communities through robotics education. I couldn’t help but marvel at the powerful drones they had there; one even had VR capabilities! The locals also offered us a selection of home-grown fruit, ranging from fresh Brazil nuts to rambutan (which I found very surprising because I’d previously only ever seen it in East Asia). “Wow!” I thought, “
 
Ananda ⁠ 03 One of my MIT friends from Brazil More like cupuASSu. A cousin of cacao, cupuaçu is a very popular fruit in Northern Brazil. But don’t let its innocent looks deceive you! Almost every dessert we ate in Manaus contained it in some form… which was kind of a problem for us because it tasted like raw fish soaked in kerosene. (I could probably write an entire blog post about how much I despise cupuaçu, but I’ll focus on the positives of the trip instead.) Fred wading into water. After the sky cleared, we walked along the river bank, where we saw some kids doing backflips off tall trees into the river. Apparently, this inspired a group (including Fred) so much that they waded into the river to try to join the kids. At night, there was a dress rehearsal for an upcoming festival in the city, and we were encouraged to attend. In true MIT fashion, however, I elected to stay back at the hotel and write my thermodynamics lab report. I certainly appreciated the extra few hours of sleep, but admittedly I somewhat regret not seeing a blue Coca-Cola advertisement in person. Fred picture of the day. Day 3 We started off the third day by visiting a museum about the history of Manaus. It was interesting to learn about the local history (especially after taking

Next, we went to a market in the middle of the city. Some vendors offered some… rather interesting items (“all natural Amazonian Viagra™ – made from guaraná!” one sign read), although I was drawn more toward the handmade musical instruments they had on display. Specifically, they had an assortment of wooden slide whistles and recorders. I quickly discovered that the recorders had similar fingerings to a clarinet, so I played a few snippets from our more classical repertoire, much to the amusement of the others on the trip. https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WhatsApp-Video-2023-03-26-at-22.27.04.mp4 For lunch, we went to a “floating restaurant” (basically a restaurant on a boat) where we could see monkeys, iguanas, and giant water lilies. On the way, we passed the Meeting of the Waters – a natural phenomenon where the Rio Negro and Rio Amazonas meet but don’t mix for
 
6 kilometres ⁠ 05 Almost 4 miles An aerial view of the meeting of the waters (not my picture). Nevertheless, there were still advantages to being on the water – we saw dolphins in the river! We only saw the regular grey dolphins, but there are also pink ones like this in the river. However, they’re extremely rare. As we ate lunch, a storm was brewing overhead. We didn’t pay too much attention to it, but a heavy rain pour broke out just as we were about to leave, stranding us for an hour! Being musicians, however, we all decided to pass the time by singing the songs in our upcoming concert. Before long, the storm passed, and we were back at the hotel. Fred picture of the day. In the blink of an eye, the first third of the trip was over already. But the real Fredventure is just getting started! Stay tuned for parts 2 and 3, featuring: A tour of the rainforest. Indigenous instruments and rhythms. More Fred shenanigans. The science of disaster films. And why you should join MITWE too (

when i attended cpw as a senior in high school, my favorite events were cpwacc, firehose, next sing karaoke, and handwhistling. this past weekend was my last ever cpw, so i decided to revisit some of the same events i attended four years ago cpwacc cpwacc, short for cpw a cappella concert, is an annual event where all the mit a cappella groups perform for around ten minutes each in high school i watched the ohms sing  this mashup  of  ennodu nee irundhaal  and  permanent . the first few seconds of that performance were some of the most ethereal and gorgeous sounds i’d ever heard, and the chords in the climax of permanent some three minutes later were so perfect, and that was when i knew i wanted to join the ohms even though i didn’t have formal singing experience and knew nothing about south asian music other than having watched three idiots now i’m part of the ohms, and we performed for the high schoolers at cpwacc last friday. i’ve spent the past four years singing and writing a lot of music, trying to create sounds as beautiful as the ones i heard back then and failing for the most part. it’s been a lot of fun and we’ve had some good concerts and i’ve become a much better vocalist in the process, but… i’ve scoured the musical world during college, taking world music and film music and western music classes, searching for and finding and mashing up songs in english hindi tamil spanish french german welsh mandarin sanskrit, trying to find the right modes and harmonies and syllables, and still,  why do i feel things when i listen to other peoples’ performances but not my own? why does nothing ever sound as powerful as the songs in my memories? why is none of the music i write good enough? maybe discovering new musical genres always feels like this. maybe music always sounds better as a first-time listener than as a composer or performer. even so, i can’t help but feel like i’ve failed, both as a creator and a musician. i’ve already written all the music i will ever write for the ohms, and none of it will ever be as good as the first song i heard from them firehose firehose is an event hosted by esp (educational studies program), a student group that organizes educational programs for local middle schoolers and high schoolers. basically the way firehose works is that current mit students teach classes on whatever topics they want to, and then you can show up for whichever classes you want as a high schooler i liked firehose because esp seemed to have people who were passionate about running educational events smoothly, and because they had cute plushies. nowadays i still think that assessment was correct; i’ve had great experiences teaching and helping out with esp programs over the past few years, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that they’re the only logistically competent student group i’ve encountered at mit (some other student groups also run large events and do a decent job, but they often struggle heavily with problems like procrastination and delegation or regularly end up in situations where a few people end up having to do everyone else’s tasks). there’s a lot of focus on  maintenance  and documentation and organizational improvement, and because of this they’re one of the communities at mit that i respect very highly anyway, the last time i went to firehose i tried to bake something and failed because i mixed up tablespoons and teaspoons. when i went on thursday i watched some high schoolers bake correctly, and then i taught some math and python next sing karaoke next house is a dorm at mit, and they have a group called next sing where people sing together. they also throw large karaoke parties twice a year, one of which happens during cpw when i was in high school i basically only listened to classical music because i spent a lot of time playing cello in orchestras, and as a result i didn’t know much about non-classical music. so when i went to karaoke events i didn’t sing much, but i still thought they were fun, and i was jealous of people who knew a lot of pop music because they seemed popular and socially competent and well-adjusted and i was none of those things i took my lack of music knowledge very seriously, to the point where i began making lists of songs to learn, and then i would go through the list one song at a time and loop that song continuously for thirty minutes or an hour or however long it took until i had it memorized, at which point i would move onto the next song. i memorized a few hundred songs in that manner, and afterwards i felt a little less insecure about my music knowledge that all happened at the end of high school. nowadays i know a lot of songs and sing a lot at karaoke events, but there are other concerns on my radar – for instance, other people move their bodies to music a lot more naturally than i do. maybe someday i’ll decide to take that seriously too, and then i’ll spend a few dozen hours figuring out how to move better, but it’s not a priority for me at the moment. i think i’ve realized there will always be people that look cooler than you at parties handwhistling when i first went to cpw there were some east campus residents who ran an event teaching people how to handwhistle (whistling by making specific shapes with your hands and blowing air through them). i can’t whistle normally, but i got really close to figuring out handwhistling before the event ended, and then i forgot about it and stopped practicing so i looked for an event on this year’s cpw schedule that would allow me to finish learning handwhistling, and didn’t see one. then i realized that probably all the avid handwhistlers had graduated already, and that almost nobody from my first cpw was still around god i feel so old

This is your reminder that your reason for choosing a college doesn’t have to be deep or profound or whatever. Vibes are important. It’s 100% acceptable to choose based on whether people  recognize your Homestuck jacket MIT had a subculture that was unabashedly nerdy, something I closely identify with. No one at U recognized the Homestuck jacket that I wore throughout the entire weekend I was there, yet two people pointed it out the one night I was at MIT. This is relevant because today is both CPW, MIT’s admitted student weekend, and Homestuck Day, 4/13. Check out the  new Homestuck reader’s guide source:  @A4MP3R10S on Twitter April 13 is special for me because it’s Homestuck Day, and Homestuck is one of the reasons I chose MIT. I’m celebrating by wearing  a Homestuck shirt I would like to talk about Homestuck If you’re here for CPW, maybe something that happens today will be part of the reason you’ll choose MIT. Maybe it’ll be a sudden moment of realization. Maybe it’ll be something silly like maids with cat ears, or trash bins painted blue, or glow-in-the-dark frisbees. Then maybe April 13 will be special for you, too, for being one of the reasons you choose MIT.

college spring break is everything I wanted it to be and more, which is unfortunate since I just came back from my second and final one :’) I went to
 
San Juan, Puerto Rico ⁠ 01 there's a lot to be said here about PR's status as one of the oldest colonies, definitely more than could fit in a single blog post. I won't dive into the history and implications of U.S imperialism here, but I want to emphasize that awareness is important, and I do not fw blithely gallivanting in PR without educating yourself and being respectful the most common spots for MIT students that I’m aware of are Puerto Rico, Aruba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Miami, but I’ve also seen a handful of people who went to Iceland, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark. Puerto Rico is the most popular location by far, though. I ran into at least two dozen people at a club, and I saw another 20 or so on my 5 AM flight back to Boston. I’d estimate there being at least 200 MIT people there, and last year probably had even more. pre-trip preparation was limited. we bought tickets during IAP, booked Airbnbs at the start of the semester, and reserved tickets for rainforest entry a month in advance (they sell out fast). we also decided on having a rental car for four of the eight days we were there. and that was pretty much it! admittedly, one or two people assumed the burden of planning, and I was not one of them, but things still worked out. break started on Friday the 24th, but we flew out at—no, I’m not joking—5 AM on Thursday. packing was done immediately prior since I had a midterm on Wednesday. I committed to not bringing my laptop since I knew I wouldn’t be getting any work done anyways, but the decision tormented me. an MIT student not working for over a week? unthinkable. after we landed, we got coffee and lunch, checked into our Airbnbs, and headed to a pop up restaurant for some arepas. when we were sufficiently stuffed, we hit the beach and then got
 
mofongo ⁠ 02 a traditional Puerto Rican dish with fried plantain it was an amazing first day, and things only got better on Friday. we went to a beachside brewery, battled some waves, and then went back to La Placita. it was just as fun as it was the first time, and a refreshing change from the clubs I’m used to, which are lame and have a cover charge. on Saturday, we finally left the area and headed to Old San Juan, which is renowned for its cobblestone streets and colorful buildings. it was idyllic, and the beautiful weather made me feel even more grateful of how different everything was from dreary, dismal Boston (I know I’m shitting on Boston a lot but personally I’m sickened by the weather and cannot do another year here). afterwards, we went to snorkel at a beach that had coral reefs. only a few of us bought snorkel sets in advance, so we traded between ourselves and tried to catch a glimpse of the fish and sea turtles around. when the sun started to set, we went to grab some of the best tacos I’ve ever eaten at a taco truck, and then ended the night at La Placita. again. Sunday was our recovery day for everything we’d done in the past three days. I’m pretty sure I got out of bed at 4 pm and then immediately went to the beach. it was a necessary rest day since we woke up at 6 AM the next morning to head to the El Yunque National Forest, a culturally significant rainforest home to hundreds of plant and animal species. right after parking our rental cars, we climbed for a few minutes to reach a series of stunning waterfalls. it was absolutely breathtaking, and we waded in them for a bit before promptly running to take cover from a sudden bout of rain. it ended within a few minutes, so we continued onwards. we hiked about five miles, making it all the way to the highest point in the rainforest and back in about four hours. we stopped at the top to eat the lunches we’d packed and also took a few detours, so we spent a decent chunk of the day in the forest. in the late afternoon, we headed to a nearby beach, which was one of the prettiest I’ve ever seen. we spent a while being idiots in the water, then went out to eat mofongo. other than the fact that our car got   stuck in the sand, it was a gorgeous day, and my favorite one of the trip. Tuesday was another chill beach day, which was good because Wednesday was the final boss of the trip. we did a “chinchorreo,” which is essentially a roadtrip to several dive bars around the island in an LED-covered bus filled with dozens of people. it was insane. the trip was organized by some Puerto Rican members of Skullhouse, a MIT fraternity. it included ~40 Skulls brothers, the 15 people in my group, and maybe 30 or so friends of the frat. all together, there were nearly 100 MIT students crammed onto two buses. we had no idea what to expect, but when the buses started blaring—and I mean  —music as soon as we hit the road, we started to wonder if we’d make it through the seven-hour adventure. although my ears could handle it, I saw a bunch of people buy earplugs so they could withstand the ride. the other bus (aka the uglier bus since I sprinted for the cool one) the first stop was an hour away, so we drove all the way to the south of the island. as we drove, people stood up to dance to the Bad Bunny that was blasting around us. if it weren’t for the poles and ceiling handles the bus had to offer , I would worry that people would be sent flying through the open windows…the bus was barreling down the highway at a breakneck speed, after all. my school bus rides never went that hard, so I was thoroughly unprepared for the experience. the first stop was an restaurant and bar situated alongside the coast. the views were beautiful, and it was great to find solace on solid ground after an hour of dancing on a speeding bus. everyone had the chance to mingle and find food before we were boarding the buses once again and setting off for the next stop. the second place was my favorite; it had Instagrammable slushy drinks and a dance floor. the heat was starting to get to me, but I had a great time hanging out with a bunch of friends from different social circles. the third and fourth stop were a blur, and by the time we made it to the final stop, a good number of people were starting to fall asleep. we had very low morale for the last spot, and the one-hour wait for dinner was painful, especially since every other table got their food first and started taking a salsa lesson in front of us. by the time our food arrived, we were on our last legs and wanted nothing more but to go home and get some rest. sadly, we had a long drive ahead of us, and since the sun was gone and the windows were down, it was freezing. on top of that, the music was still pounding in our years, and the bus kept launching us off the seats every time it hit a bump. as icing on the cake, the buses would honk loudly every time we passed each other, so there was constant blaring in addition to the unbearable music. I had a terrible time since I wanted to fall sleep but couldn’t, not even a little bit. when we made it back to San Juan, I was ready to cry tears of joy. a few people in my group wanted nothing more than to go to bed after the grueling experience we’d have, but I started to appreciate it more and more after making it back to our Airbnb. when’s the next time I’ll be able to dance to pounding reggaeton on a bus with all my friends, taking in incredible scenery on the way to a cool oceanside restaurant? probably never. the trip back tested me, but the overall experience was great. reenergized, a good number of people from the chinchorreo rallied for La Placita. as expected of a Wednesday, it was a bit boring, but it was still an interesting time to be surrounded by tons of MIT students in a club far away from Boston. Thursday was our last day, so we spent the day revisiting our favorite spots. our flight left at 5 AM, which meant we had plenty of time to return to the hallowed halls of La Placita one last time before leaving. sure enough, we did, Ubering to the airport at 3 AM, straight from the club. the airport was crowded, but I still managed to bump into some MIT students, and was shocked to see that nearly 30 of us ended up at the same gate. and with that, I made it home in time to both recover and finish my pset due Monday. I’m glad I came back on Friday morning since not working for a week gave me a lot of anxiety about school…I don’t think I’ve   gone that long without opening my laptop. thankfully, I managed to get everything done before school started, and I made it through the first week back without losing all my morale. spring break was definitely the highlight of my semester. it was such a blissful and relaxing time, and I’m so amazed that we got my whole senior class to Puerto Rico when we can’t even organize everyone going out to dinner in Cambridge. it makes me sad to think that this will probably be the last such trip for a long time, since everyone has their own plans for post-graduation. the concept of moving away from my friends is terrifying yet inevitable, so I’m happy to have made these memories before we graduate and it becomes immensely more difficult to coordinate a vacation. I have no regrets about this trip, though! 10/10, I couldn’t have asked for a more fun way to spend my final spring break.

Very early on in my Admissions career I happened to take a slice from a cherry pie that someone had brought into the office to share. As one might expect, I was inevitably asked about my assessment of said pie. I responded that it was “good.” So instead of giving a number, I simply said “I don’t use the 1 to 10 scale.” In truth I didn’t use another scale, and had never given it much thought. I was simply being contrary because I was annoyed (possibly unreasonably) that my decision to have a slice of pie had a hidden cost in the form of this rating inquisition. Not one to give in though, I improvised, and conceived a personal scale on the spot, You guessed it. More questions. “What? I explained, “There are only three possible ratings. ‘-1’, ‘0’, and ‘1’. A   fails to meet my expectations. A   meets my expectations, and a   exceeds my expectations. The protests were immediate. I think there was a visceral reaction to a zero rating, even though it was no more arbitrary than anything else. There were also objections to my insistence on integers and the inability for additional differentiation between a zero and a one. My argument was that any potential marginal differences were not meaningful to me, and not only unnecessary, but also undesired.  And now you are thinking, “Great story David. Maybe the utility of my rating scale, (which some colloquially refer to as the duKor-Jackson scale, even though my family wants no association with it, or more colorfully the cherry pie scale,) and this particular blog post, like most things, is up to the interpretation of a given individual and how applicable it may be to them. There certainly can be value in soliciting input from others while collecting information in order to make a decision, but there is no substitute for reflecting on what has inherent value to you, relative to your own aspirations, desires and objectives. Just a little food for thought, as the time to make big decisions nears.

I’m no longer neck deep in school work, and I finally have a manageable workload, but I have spent the past few hours doing nothing in particular except think about all the things I need to do. They’re not even big things, just little chores here and there. Like taking my clothes out of the wash, sending emails, cleaning up my room for CPW, running a quick setup test for a UROP, filling out a when-to-meet, things like that. And since I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done today, instead of being reasonable and going to sleep, I’m going to write this in one sitting so I can feel like I didn’t just waste my entire day. After crawling my way to the freedom of spring break, I expected to feel refreshed, ready for a round three. But it’s not happening. I wouldn’t quite call it mental exhaustion. That’s already happened, and it’s gone now. It feels like my brain is constantly on pause, like it’s an intermission in between two acts of a play that’s lasted too long. Where did the actors go? So I go on eating through the bottom of my bag of popcorn, imagining what might happen next, what I’m supposed to do tomorrow. My lack of focus causes stress, and the stress is in turn distracting. stealing inspiration from a friend to use microsoft paint because i didn’t want to open my ipad It occurs to me that every physical and mental process has a bit of inertia involved. Starting to push a boulder is difficult, and stopping it is equally as hard. The same goes for much that happens in your brain. Take sleep for example. If you take a 15 minute nap, it’s a lot easier to wake up and go to class than it is after getting a full 8 hours of sleep. Your body has gotten comfortable in it’s state of unconsciousness, and hauling yourself up is like trying to shove the boulder to roll from a standstill. If you’re working it’s a lot more difficult to start an assignment than it is to continue working on it when your pen has already started moving. In my case, I’ve spent too long in the transition time between lab and starting my next task. I spent too long trying to decide what to do next, and because I got “comfortable” in my dilemma, tricking myself into thinking that flicking through my hundred tabs is productive, I procrastinated. It’s not even the usual “I’ll do this tomorrow” thing, it’s “I’ll start in 15 minutes, right after I read my messages”. Just like that, 2 hours passed. A similar pattern repeated for the past three days. I realize that my current issue is that the mass of whatever ball of responsibilities I’m rolling is increasing in mass without increasing in volume. I haven’t gotten more work, but my hardware is reacting otherwise. It’s taking longer for me to wake up to an alarm, and I’ve hit the snooze button more often than I did first semester. The going to a dining hall feels like more of a time commitment than it used to. I gained a higher tolerance for low effort, and I’m scared that it might start to form habit. Just, somehow, inertia increased. big rock mess with brain So what’s exactly happening? I wish there was a different, more easily resolvable answer, but it’s probably burnout, as is the answer to most of my “why is this happening to me” questions I’ve had this year. Unlike what people tend to think, burnout doesn’t disappear after a week or even two-week long break. It generally takes months to fully recover from burnout. It’s not like physical activity, where it takes only hours to regain your stamina after running a marathon and only days for your muscles to stop being sore. Recovery needs inertia as well. Once you start lightening the load, your hardware tries to hang on to that feeling, even working against your software— what   want to do, to get there. When you sleep 3 hours a night for a week and suddenly get 8 hours the day after the midterm you were cramming for, it gets so much harder to do sleep that little again. However, even though some people know that they’re burning out, that what they’re doing to survive academically isn’t sustainable, we do it anyways. Many hold the mindset of “there is nothing else I can do to get to my goals” and employ the solution of “suck it up.” I for one, despite my writing, tend to gaslight-gatekeep-guiltrip myself into doing more work. Unfortunately, there is not much girlbossing involved in fighting burnout. I’m still deciding what to do with myself. Sometimes, it almost feels like I have too much agency; there’s no one but myself to keep me in check. But given the option, I’d still choose to continue doing my little clown dance and kicking the boulder, partially to satisfy my ego, and partially to remind myself the little work I do is still a result of my own motivation. without gravity, sometimes a fire can smother itself

I have also been   person! I’ve been a camp counselor, I’ve led plenty of collaborative brainstorm-y meetings, and I’ve introduced different friend groups to each other and had that moment where I realized I needed to kickstart some name-sharing because I’m the only person who knows everyone in the room.

The MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services offices recently had a post-Pi-day study break filled with pie and trivia and, yes, an icebreaker led by yours truly. And because I am an internet gremlin, I also decided to mine my coworkers for Blog Content™️ by asking people for their consent to share their anonymous drawings from said icebreaker.

They are just as valid! Sometimes when you’re faced with a blank canvas, expected to draw something from memory with a marker, you just gotta go with the first lines you come up with. Other artists focused on representing Tim in his classic outfit of an MIT t-shirt (myself included), because how else are you going to distinguish him from a regular non-Tim beaver??? I realize I could have called this subcategory “just heads” or something along those lines, but they all had an enhanced level of chaos energy that really sets them apart. I don’t know whether to respect or fear these Tims; perhaps both. #TimTheBeaver

Today, (April 4, 2023), marks the public launch of the  STARS (Small Town and Rural Students) College Network At MIT Admissions, our  commitment to the public interest Now, as a founding member institution of the newly established STARS College Network, we plan to extend our engagement to raise awareness about and facilitate opportunities for discovery of a broader range of possibilities for post-secondary education for students who might not otherwise consider or pursue them. This initiative, specifically targeting students from small towns and rural settings, reiterates our steadfast commitment to continue to enroll the most outstanding and dynamic group of students and scholars possible, regardless of their circumstances.  After all, a vibrant academic community, composed of individuals representing an expansive cross-section of backgrounds and experiences, is essential to challenge and inspire one another to solve society’s greatest challenges.

then what to feel  with every shard of grief,  and every speck of beauty,  it is as though with this overwhelming pain and love and beauty, i have never felt anything before,  but i am not feeling anything right now  a lot of the times, i am my first invalidator. it is easy to justify happiness for being happy but not sorrow for being sad. i would be feeling overwhelmingly sad and decide i am being ~cringe~ and that it is not a big deal. but to pull out of the details of the context and think, do i really need to list out everything going wrong to feel sad? why is it that i don’t feel entitled to sorrow? the first thought is that growing up, i came up with this defense mechanism of choosing to be happy, even when things were going wrong. i didn’t want to be sad because there was the fear that if i allowed myself to be sad, i would always be sad. then, somewhere along the way, i lost ownership of sorrow.  my last words stifle in the knots of my throat, so i knew i was never to write every feeling of sadness is overshadowed by the question of whether i am entitled to feel sad, whether i have reason enough. it is weird to say that even sadness is a rich feeling.  i am still a proponent of choosing to feel happy. it helps me deal with stressful situations more calmly and clearly.  i am still a proponent of not taking myself too seriously. it helps me be embarrassed, and be cringe, and be myself, and care a little less about what i don’t (or shouldn’t) care about. it helps me ground myself in the truth that if i zoom out enough, this will not be as big as it seems.  but this does not have to nullify any part of any experience. just because i am calm in a situation does not mean it is not a stressful situation anymore. just because something isn’t ~a big deal~ in the long run, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be a big deal to me right now. it is just that when things are going wrong, having that awareness helps me get some clarity and hope.  i am just as entitled to sadness as to happiness. there is no justification needed. i can simply wake up and ~decide the sky looks sad~ and toast to its sadness. when there is something that is actively stressing me out, i can allow myself the opportunity to be sad. i can be a nuisance to myself and take up space. i can treat myself as more than a productivity machine, grinding problem sets after another, making sure i am really learning, making sure everything is in place. i can let everything around me slip and then catch it back.  when i suffer great loss, i can allow myself the opportunity to celebrate the grief. i can weep and scream and sigh until i no longer can. i can stop everything in my life for this great blue and then, when i feel less of it, i can allow myself the opportunity to stop. reflect. and catch new joys.  the joys after a sorrow need not be overshadowed by guilt. you being sad, being unrecoverably sad, does not lose you entitlement to happiness.  i can allow myself the opportunity to make every sorrow and every following happiness and every normal day and every big day a big deal.  in fact, most of the point of life is that everything is a big deal.  wouldn’t it be heartbreaking if at the end of this beautifully broken life, we find that we never saw anything well?  then, let us drown, quiet and untroubled, into the depths of this brave, blue sea. the last we will remember of us is our smiles, and isn’t that all?  recently, i have found myself succumbing to this belief of an end — this beautiful, shining trophy past everything that is now. in some world, i would graduate from MIT, and go to graduate school, and become a professor somewhere, and then get tenure, and then, life will be okay. or in a different world, i would graduate from MIT and get a high-paying job and then, life will be okay. and so on. there has been an increasing sense of trying to control my life and how the future unfolds because uncertainty  is  scary and it  is  valid to want to guide how the rest of your life goes and it  is  valid to want financial security and professional success. but i believe that no matter how much i plan and decide, in the end, what happens, happens. yes, it is okay to plan but it is also completely okay to crumple up a thousand plans and trash them and make new ones.  and then, the more important feeling is that, really, there is no end. the want to progress is innate to human nature. there will always be something new to do. if the ‘everything is okay’ phase of life is pushed past everything that ‘needs to be done,’ it might never come. with every trophy, another one comes into sight, the glimmer of each one more alluring than the previous.  to me, true, constant happiness is an illusion. what i really want, what i really want to stay with me, is peace. and then hurdles will be okay. and feeling occasionally awful will be okay. and failing and losing will be okay. this begs the question, how does one even define peace, let alone, find it? today, i feel, the only answer is that the more you learn to become yourself and live with yourself, peace will find a way into your life. it will define and announce itself.  happiness is a more fleeting concept. it is this high energy, excited state, which is great to be in, but eventually, it will wear out and you would go back to the ground state.  and so, it doesn’t make sense to run after this glorified image of what happiness is, but taking in the joy of these fading moments. perhaps, just the fact that it is so fleeting makes it so precious. it is like the dandelion flower you plucked. one wisp of air and it is gone. and it is beautiful.  when i walk past the river, i will race it,  i will fail and give up,  when i walk on grass,  i will feel feeble melancholy, who would ever walk on roses, when i walk past the field, i will walk in crooked steps to not step on the fallen leaves,  i will pluck a leaf from a bush (i will claim it called to me) and bring it to another  today is the tenth snow of winter,  i will try to eat it,  when it falls on me,  i will claim it loves me,  in my hands-on astronomy class, we are learning to be more observant of the night sky. every Wednesday, we go up to the roof of the building and mount our telescopes and configure our camera, but in the end, all we do is we look at the sky. it is a beautiful feeling. it is beautiful to think that humans looked at the night sky and stared long enough to draw things out of the glimmering stars. it is beautiful to think that the human brain came up with scales and models that estimate the universe incredibly well. it is also beautiful, to just, look, to forget the value and the science and the history. beauty doesn’t require literacy. or thought. it only asks for you to look.  the truth is, happiness is perhaps the most welcoming feeling in the world. it is everywhere. there is happiness in beauty and in loss. in all the things that happen everyday. joy breathes in the same air as you. there is joy in rusty old jokes, in sparkling new friendships, in boring work, in exciting discoveries, in careful music, in unkempt laughter, in that fried egg i want to eat tomorrow and in the cup of chai i drink every day. any or all of this is enough to fill a man’s heart. rinse, repeat. rummage around your heart, find a cause, take all the grief, put a ribbon on it, shoot it with raging arrows of anger. if you breathe out ashes, ask yourself why you insist on breathing in fire? when you are past easy, made-up answers, ask yourself again. this time, trust not us, especially not we sing of if true happiness exists, it is waiting for you to jump out 
resting on wounds like dew on roses. it waits for you to be eager, to let go of the meteor in your fist, accept warmth as the perfectly bright future, and let waves of breath-taking hurt drown in it #beauty #happiness

i spent spring break writing. writing blog posts, writing things for our  informatics olympiad puzzle club on tuesday night, i ate dinner at et, one of the independent living groups in mit. i pledged to et this semester, which means i’m a house member now. i still live in my room in east campus, but i’m trying to spend more time in et. anyway, last tuesday, andy and dylan made an undertale-themed menu, with a steak in the shape of mettaton’s face, dog salad, instant noodles, popato chisps, and starfait. there were also fourteen tomatoes. the steak was pretty good, both the actual steak and the tofu steak. i haven’t eaten steak in a long time. esp has a yearly traditional texas roadhouse valentine’s day dinner, which i couldn’t make this year because i was running a game for the assassins guild. it didn’t happen in 2022 or 2021, and i couldn’t make it in 2020 for some reason i don’t remember. in fact, the last time i ate steak might be back in the philippines? on wednesday night, i ate dinner at gyukaku, a yakiniku restaurant in harvard square. i have fond memories of eating at gyukaku with a friend group from promys, this math summer camp i went to in high school. it reminds me of good times, so i’ve eaten there every few months. it’d be more often if it wasn’t so pricey, but the food is pretty good. i ate with sean and steven, friends i met doing math contests in the philippines; steven goes here and sean goes to harvard. the three of us talked about credit, as in, the credit card kind of credit. i kind of knew that credit was a thing in the us, but it feels like a Real Thing now that i’m going to rent apartments and such. i dunno, back in the philippines being able to pay your security deposits or pay a few months in advance was good enough financial proof. anyway, i applied for a credit card and i’m expecting to get it soon. on thursday night, i ate dinner at five spices house, a sichuan restaurant in central square. i went with alan and vincent, the bloggers. i’ve been to sichuan once, when i was sixteen years old, and we went to a hotpot place, the first time i’ve been to any hotpot place, and i was unprepared for the 麻辣. i still amn’t, so i stuck to the blander food at five spices. it was still great. we talked about future plans. i noticed that our experiences with software engineering are quite different. last summer, vincent worked for a 10-person company, i worked for a 100-person company, and alan worked for a 100,000-person company. we all have offers to work for similar-sized companies in a few months, which vincent and i have accepted. on friday night, i ate dinner at the dining hall in winthrop house, a harvard dorm. i went with hahn, a high school friend from promys. this was my first time eating at harvard dining, and hahn informed me that this was one of the weaker nights, and usually the food was better. the food wasn’t   bad, and at least neither of us spent any money. after dinner, we went to an a capella concert with the fallen angels, lowkeys, and opportunes. this is another one of those firsts, as i’ve never been to a harvard a capella concert before, and i had a great time! much like the a capella concerts in mit, people gave speeches for the graduating seniors, who all had solos, and there were alumni songs and encores. it wasn’t as hype as i’d liked, but maybe that’s because it was held in the fancy sanders theater. on saturday night, i ate dinner alone. which, after this whirlwind of a spring break, was a nice chance for rest.

for most of my life i was very prone to envy. part of that was because of the academic environment i was raised in – other people doing well on math contests meant i would have a worse rank, other people getting into top colleges meant i would have a harder time doing so myself, and so on – but it also extended to non-academic endeavors as well. for instance, i remember feeling little pangs of resentment whenever one of my friends found a new friend group that they began spending lots of time with, or whenever someone i knew joined twitter and acquired more followers than me seemingly without much effort now i understand that these kinds of events are often blessings in disguise. friends joining new groups can be a good way for you to meet new people, having acquaintances with lots of twitter followers is great for your own account because occasionally those people will like your tweets and amplify them to a larger audience, and so on. i have a bad habit where i tend to assume at first that most landscapes are competitive and zero-sum and lately i’ve been realizing this is rarely the case this became really clear to me around a year ago when i was hanging out with a close friend and we were talking about our problems, and then suddenly i recognized that their troubles regularly bled over into my life and their victories regularly uplifted me, and of all the things they could do as a friend to make me feel better there was perhaps nothing more impactful than if they conquered their own demons. in that moment i realized that i wanted nothing more than for my friend’s life to be as good as possible, for them to move past all their insecurity and indecisiveness and become the person they were trying to be. that was the first time i understood that my life is extremely aligned with other peoples’, far more than i’d previously thought after realizing that i felt very stupid and very guilty.  stupid  for having taken twenty years to arrive at the realization;  guilty  because i wondered if me taking so long meant that i was a bad person. i wondered how my friends overcame their jealousy and found their way to being genuinely supportive of others – has everyone else always been like this since they were a child? or was it taught to them, and if so, when and how and by whom? i’ve never explicitly voiced these questions before, because i was worried that perhaps i was alone and whoever i asked would realize i was a terrible or selfish person. nowadays i am less worried about that because i believe i have friends who will be forgiving of my past, and that’s why i feel comfortable writing this post my current view is that there is a lot of work to do in the world and there are a lot of problems to solve, and we win when everyone wins. i don’t know most of the people i walk past each day, but whatever they’re trying to accomplish, i hope they do a good job, and i hope they grow in the ways they want to grow in and become the best possible versions of themselves. even if their success doesn’t affect me directly, at the very least it’ll make for more interesting conversation down the line if i ever talk to them and yes of course there are exceptions, of course there are conflicts of interest, of course there are people with antithetical values and priorities, but i choose to believe that most people do not fall into those categories, that my life is positively correlated with the lives of most people around me i don’t mean to suggest that i’m immune to jealousy now. there’s a  popular model of the brain  where you have a system 1 which provides fast, impulsive reactions to stimuli and a system 2 which provides slower, more thoughtful responses, and while my system 2 is much cleaner than it used to be there’s definitely still a lot of jealousy in my system 1 – occasionally when something good happens to someone i know, one of my initial gut reactions will still be a negative one. i don’t know if this is true for everyone or just me, and i don’t know if this is possible to change deliberately on my part (i think we’ve probably evolved jealousy as an instinctual response in these situations and that seems hard to eliminate), but at this point it’s not something i worry about anymore. i know that i’m a healthier person than i used to be, and i don’t think purity of thought is a realistic goal to beat myself up over

Whether you blog for a job and get paid by the hour, or you’re writing yardlong screeds in a blog that no one reads, you probably know how hard it is to write good blog posts. Thankfully, you don’t actually have to write good blog posts; you only need to have the appearance of writing good ones! Follow these top tips and you’ll be writing formulaic blog posts that you can publish week after week. If you’re having any trouble following these tips, I recommend reading  CMU / Parallel Universe Open strong and generate excitement by giving a preview of what you’re discussing. What better way to do this than with a table of contents, which tells your readers what the sections of your post are, and how they’re ordered? Way more useful than an introduction! Nothing says  rationalist blog post  reader to draw the conclusion themselves.” In fanfiction, song lyrics are seen as cringy, annoying, and immature. But you’re not writing fanfic, you’re writing  . Doesn’t matter if it’s unrelated; no one’s gonna read the lyrics anyway. Bonus points if your song’s in a non-English language, or if it’s from an obscure Filipino artist no one’s heard of. Chances are you’ve  given up on your artistic pursuits One way to cover deep insecurities about your cultural identity is to assert it in your writing. Go ahead and say kalabasa instead of squash and sitaw instead of green beans. If anyone calls you out, insist that they’re different cultivars, even if they taste exactly the same. It makes you look loquacious, backformation from loquacity, from Latin   “talkativeness”, cognate to circumlocution, eloquence, and soliloquy. If you’re more daring than I was, you can even say kare-kare comes from Tamil கறி. Don’t transliterate it, it’s cooler that way. Unfortunately, most readers haven’t read every single blog post you’ve ever written.  Help them out by linking even the most tenuously related blog posts you’ve written If the main argument of your post is something like, “you can never perfectly predict the result of each decision, because if you did then there wouldn’t be a decision in the first place,” make sure to repeat that argument multiple times. But make sure you bury the argument with some story or conversation. You don’t want to risk readers understanding the argument you’re trying to make. This is likely your only chance to apply the things you’ve learned in math class. Pick whatever topic is easiest to talk about, then compare it to the topic of your blog post. Don’t worry about whether it’s interesting; your hapless readers are forced to read it anyway. For example, both “decision tree” and “college decision” have the word “decision”, and that’s close enough. Figures provide visual variety, break long walls of text, and distract readers from critically analyzing your flimsy excuse of a main idea. Any conversation can be made deep and philosophical by fudging the details. Consider this example conversation: “Why do you like solving such big puzzles?” I asked. “Because it’s more satisfying to work on bigger problems than smaller ones,” he replied. “Yeah, but wouldn’t the stakes be higher? An error in a larger project could be disastrous compared to an error in a small one.” “Which makes it more important to be cautious about the moves you make on the board.” “So you fill in the things that you know are correct?” I asked. He nodded. “But you can’t always have all the information! Sometimes you’re at the point of your life when you don’t know what to do, and you have to take a leap of faith.” He thought for a few seconds, and said, “I hope I don’t get to that point, then.” Compare this to the original: “Wow, that’s a big Masyu. I don’t like big Masyus.” I asked. “It feels better when you finish a big Masyu, though.” he replied. “Yeah, but then if you make a mistake, you have way more to undo.” He shrugs. “I only fill in things I’m sure of.” “But what if you get stuck and have to guess?” I asked. He thought for a few seconds, and said, “Uh, I dunno.” If you’ve already made strained metaphors to a technical topic, you might as well drag another interest of yours into the mix and talk about MIT history. Wait. What’s that? You’re   interested in the history of FIXIT? You’re not interested in MIT history in general?! Too bad. As Abraham Lincoln once said, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” He also said that “The only thing worse than being misquoted on the internet is not being misquoted on the internet.” Maya Angelou later said the exact same thing. If the central idea of your writing is along the lines of, “accurately guessing what happens after making a choice is impossible, for if it was possible, was it truly a choice?” make certain to reiterate that idea in many places. However, make certain you disguise the idea with some anecdote or dialogue. It’s undesirable for perusers to comprehend the idea you’re attempting to convey. Leave no words discarded. Instead of editing a section out, move it to somewhere unobstrusive, like the end of the post. Even if people who’ve read drafts of the post say you should cut some part, you should never listen to them, as more words can never hurt your blog post. Okay, this is all a joke. This is April Fools’ Day, after all, and I’m making light of my style of writing blog posts. I enjoy going off on tangents from time to time, but I do try to keep my tangents to a minimum, or inside footnotes, when possible. Yesterday’s post about CMU was an exaggeration of the “tips” in this post, meant to making this post (and the CMU post) funnier in retrospect. Hence why I went on an extended tangent about buggy, though I think it’s justified, because it was the   that people cared about it a lot. Either way, there’s no excuse for bad writing, and I should’ve stuck to the relevant details. My apologies to everyone, and I hope the joke doesn’t distract you from the fact that in nineteen ninety-eight The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hеll In A Cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer’s table. #April Fools

The bloggers’ old avatars were drawn by a talented professional in a recognizable and well-liked style. But some of us thought, what if we could do a worse job? Wouldn’t that be better? Today, I am proud to introduce to you a new, anti-cohesive style for the MIT Admissions blogs. We’re harnessing the incredible power of our students to draw doodles when they should be psetting, and we think you will be amazed by the results. Make sure to read the thoughtful artists’ statements below the images! Shuli: “wdym, i am a qt” Alan: “this is gonna be my portraitist origin story” Fatima: “Upon further consideration, I have decided not to quit my day job.” Paolo: “i’ve decided that it’s time for me to go back to my roots. no drawing could possibly communicate the amount of #swag i had back then, so instead, here is a photo. this was not my daily attire at the ripe old age of 15, but it is clear that i was far cooler then than i am now.” Jebby: “im just a silly billy who came here to make some bloggies” Kano: “my brain exploded out into my hair <3” CJ: “if i had a nickel for every time i had to redraw my blogger avatar for april fools day, i’d have two nickels. which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice. right?” #April Fools

[joint post] part 1: a jaunt across Europe 
<|end of blog|>
<|start of blog|>
I visited CMU this weekend! This is pretty long, so here’s a table of contents: One Two Three Four Five Six Seven It doesn’t seem to make sense 
Everything was going well 
Guess that was just the surface 
Cause underneath I could tell 
No, I couldn’t, I couldn’t tell One of the cool things about helping run  HMMT PUMAC wrote about it too CMIMC It went quite different from my PUMAC visit. When I visited PUMAC four years ago, I went with a big group with lots of people I was close friends with. This visit was a lot smaller. From MIT were me, Brandon W. ’24, and Alex H. ’26, and from Harvard was Nathan S. Harvard ’24. I’ve talked to Brandon and Nathan a bit before, but I didn’t know them super well, and I didn’t know Alex at all before this weekend. The way we got there was different too. If we’d gone by bus or train, it’d take like, what, 12 hours? But through some miracle, airfare happened to be cheap, and we flew there instead. A Friday afternoon flight to Newark, then two hours later, a flight to Pittsburgh. Brandon took an earlier flight, so it was me, Alex, and Nathan. It was lowkey a bit awkward at first, but we got conversation going eventually. Like, we were talking about classes, and Nathan said he was   in something, and I was like, “woah woah woah, don’t you mean  ?” And he replied, “well, when you talk to MIT students, you have to use their language, right?” The joke is that Harvard calls them  concentrations Gotta say, it’s fun to be an MIT student pretending to be a Havard student, which is how I learned all of this. I imagine Nathan must have fun pretending to be an MIT student too. It’s interesting to me how many MIT and Harvard undergrads know a lot about how the other school works, even if they’ve never cross-registered. Maybe it’s because we all want to imagine how things would’ve turned out, in the universe where we went to the other school. We took a flight to Newark, had dinner at the airport, then took another flight to Pittsburgh. I’m not much of a photo person, but I took this photo at the Pittsburgh airport because I thought the elevator was cool. You can wave instead of pressing a button! Anyway, Nathan got a rental car and we drove from the airport to the city. Now, Nathan and Alex both drive, and I don’t. And while we were in the parking lot, neither of them could get any data on their phones, so I had to use my phone to look up directions. Because I didn’t know how to drive, I relayed the instructions at all the wrong times, and couldn’t answer things like “should I switch lanes?” I later realized that I could’ve just unmuted my phone and have the app read out the directions. He was my brightest star 
In the night I couldn’t ignore 
Cause when he plays his guitar 
He knows exactly where to go 
He takes the lead and I follow We got to CMU. I stayed a bit at the student center, which they call UC, much like how MIT’s is nicknamed the Stud. Thanks to  eduroam NOI.PH Gram talked about how reduplication was mentioned in one of his linguistics classes. I’ve  talked about reduplication before Pangasinense Bisaya mutually intelligible Anyway, David asked what reduplication was, and Gram gave some examples in  Tagalog when you’re both in a foreign place David and Gram show me how to take the bus to their apartment. Pittsburgh public transportation is centered on buses, unlike how Boston’s is centered on trains. There’s this cool app called  Transit visited every station on the MBTA a look at the system map . On the bus ride there we talk about food. I talked about how I recently cooked  sisig ginataan ET kalabasa sitaw Gram shares how he and David once tried to make  kare-kare atsuete , that’s commitment. Kare-kare is known for taking a long time to cook, so it’s usually reserved for special occasions. I wouldn’t dare try to make kare-kare if I didn’t have my whole afternoon set aside. Also, see all those links in the last few paragraphs? It’s nice not having to explain what any of these are; it’s something that the three of us all knew. I love everyone in MIT, but I don’t know that many people I can talk about these things with. Also, did you know that kare-kare is cognate with curry? The etymology of  kare-kare curry Gram and David showed me around their apartment. The wifi networks are named something like  Kutsinta Bibingka baybayin bouillon cubes sinigang how I choose to express mine It’s wild how much the three of us shared. We’re all Filipino, all in the same year, all studying computer science. The whole thing made me wonder: if I’d gone to CMU, would I be sharing this apartment with them? What would it be like, living in an apartment off-campus, instead of a dorm five minutes away from my classes? I might’ve cooked Filipino dishes more often, or knew how to write Baybayin better. But then I wouldn’t be in my  awesome East Campus room on floorpi Aimlessly I follow I woke up on Saturday, took a bus back to CMU, and tried to find the room the graders were supposed to be in. CMU’s campus is a bit smaller than MIT’s campus, according to the boundaries in  their campus map our campus map The buildings in CMU’s campus have names like Porter or Doherty, unlike MIT’s  numbering system We waited a bit for the exams to come in. We were first grading the Computer Science Team Round; you can view  the problems on the CMIMC website Let’s recast the problem in terms of a  decision tree 6.390 Introduction to Machine Learning The main idea is that we want to maximize the  information gain It makes me wonder what it’d look like if I made my decisions to maximize the information gain of each choice. I have no idea what that actually means in practice, but I’m certain there’s an interpretation that makes this sound deep. Figure it out in the comments I guess. We graded the CS round. All the papers were double graded, and the two graders had to agree on the score for each question. Most people graded the third problem, because it was the hardest to grade, and we spent a decent amount of time arguing over the rubric and whether or not people’s mistakes were “minor” or “major”. I found it kinda fun, actually. In a parallel universe 
Everything in reverse 
Maybe you could be mine 
In a parallel universe 
Where timing is kind to us 
Maybe we would be alright After the CS round, we waited for the individual rounds to come in. Algebra and Number Theory, Combinatorics and Computer Science, Geometry. These were short answer problems, so they were quicker to grade, but it meant there was a lot of time in between the grading that was waiting. It felt strange, being in that room and waiting, as the only people I knew were the people from HMMT. My other friends from CMU who were helping with CMIMC were busy being proctors. So I made conversation with Brandon, whom I saw solving this huge  Masyu “Why do you like solving such big puzzles?” I asked. “Because it’s more satisfying to work on bigger problems than smaller ones,” he replied. “Yeah, but wouldn’t the stakes be higher? An error in a larger project could be disastrous compared to an error in a small one.” “Which makes it more important to be cautious about the moves you make on the board.” “So you fill in the things that you know are correct?” I asked. He nodded. “But you can’t always have all the information! Sometimes you’re at the point of your life when you don’t know what to do, and you have to take a leap of faith.” He thought for a few seconds, and said, “I hope I don’t get to that point, then.” It was kinda awkward being in that room at times, so I also wandered around the building a bit. I remember spotting this sign in one of the bathrooms: I thought it was interesting that their  facilities email facilities phone number HowToGAMITs Grading happened, and then we went to the closing ceremonies. On the way, I finally meet up with Daniel N. CMU ’24 and Eric O. CMU ’24, who are like two people I kinda knew in the CMIMC staff. I guess there’s also Thomas L. CMU ’23, although that’s more of a “know of” each other relationship. It’s strange how the internet leads to these friends you make behind usernames, and then you meet each other in real life and it’s like, oh. There isn’t much else to write about here, except for maybe  Po-Shen Loh Dinner was fine. The CMIMC staff took more than half the space in the restaurant. I sat with Alex, Alex’s host whose name I forget, Brandon, and Daniel. We talked a lot about MIT and CMU’s differences. Like how, in MIT, 90% of undergraduates live in university housing, while in CMU it’s 50%. Which has downstream effects on student life, like affecting where people go to do work together. We all stayed until closing time, and applauded when someone fronted the bill for everyone. I put myself to blame 
I let you get away 
But I feel it coming back 
I close my eyes, I flashback 
And just like that, I relapsed I walked back with Daniel, who wanted to give me a tour of CMU. I’ve never been much of a tourist, but if a friend was offering, sure, why not? MIT’s computer science building is the  Stata Center Daniel took me to floor 9, and we worked our way down. He shows me a bunch of offices of machine learning people, and then a bunch of offices from programming language people, and then a bunch of offices from algorithms people. I didn’t recognize a lot of the names, although I did know a few, like Guy Blelloch or Frank Pfenning. He asked me to take a picture in front of Bob Harper’s office, so we could send it to a mutual friend and tease him about it. The layout was about as confusing as Stata’s, without having the cool architecture outside, although I’d bet that their building doesn’t have roof leaks. There were fishbowl rooms and a terrace. There were research posters and that one bulletin board with pictures of all the faculty. It’s interesting to me how similar all these academic buildings are. There were many small lounges scattered through the building that people worked in. It was 10 PM on a Saturday night, so I was surprised by how many people I saw. Then again, it’s another one of those downstream effects; most people live far from campus, so if you wanted to work you’d probably go to campus. The largest lounge was on floor 6, where Daniel showed me his favorite water dispenser. “There’s nothing special about it,” he said, “other than it being the dispenser I use the most.” He showed me a table where people left free food. MIT has a strong culture of free food, like  a free food mailing list Daniel told me many other things about the building and SCS, their  School of Computer Science SCS Day “Is it, uh, Emma?” I asked. “Yeah, it is!” she said. “Nah, just kidding, it’s Maggie.” I don’t actually remember if it was Maggie, but it was a name that didn’t start with the letter E. The five were complaining about the food, but paused for a bit when Daniel introduced me as a “senior”. “As in, a prospective student?” someone asked. “Maybe we shouldn’t be complaining about the food then.” “Nah, I’m an MIT senior,” I said. “And I bet the dining in MIT isn’t much better.” Helplessly I relapsed We cleared the bottom floors of the building before heading outside. From afar, I see the  Pausch Bridge “Damn, it’s gayer than I am, huh,” I said. Daniel chuckled. He told me about the history of the bridge, and the symbolism of connecting the CS and drama buildings. I was surprised with how large the drama building is, and he told me that it was a big thing in CMU, which explained all the posters for plays I saw earlier that day. Theater is a thing here in MIT, but probably not as big as it is in CMU, based on the building sizes. Daniel walks me around the  buggy It’s the kind of thing you can tell people are serious about because of how many things have names. The parts of the course are named Hill 1, Hill 2, the freeroll, the chute, then Hill 3, 4, and 5. The distance a buggy travels beyond the chute and before being pushed on Hill 3 is called rollout, and is measured in windows, based on the windows of the adjacent Porter Hall. Buggies can be standard or reverse trikes based on wheel placement. Buggies go through safety tests called capes and drops. Weekly practice is called rolls. There are pushing styles called bump and run and stiff arm. There’s also  84 pages of rules I probably wouldn’t have liked doing buggy myself. Waking up early, vehicle engineering, running and pushing; I don’t like any of these things. But what awed me was the intensity, the commitment to the bit. Because that’s one of the things I love best about MIT, how people take things seriously,  overengineering everything Inside, we walk past a buggy display, and I take a picture of Daniel so I don’t have a wall of text in this section. We walk to the bus stop and wait for the bus together. He was planning to walk home, but I told Daniel that this was the last time we’d never see each other again after this. That’s not true, since we’ll both be around New York this summer, where he’s doing an internship and I’m working full-time. And there’s maybe other times we’d see each other after that. I just say “we’ll never see each other again after this” when I say goodbye, as a personal tradition. But when it comes to friends I don’t live near to, I don’t want to take any chances, you know? If I say that every time I say goodbye to someone, I’ll be right eventually. He asks me whether I would’ve liked going to CMU. Now, I’m a fan of hypotheticals; see  Days in lives that aren’t mine A Boring Friday I’ve done this before I thought about it for a bit, and I had an answer: In parallel universe 
Maybe you’d be my first 
I could be your only one 
Oh this universe is a curse 
Where’s timing so cruel to us 
I don’t know how to be alright 
Don’t want to live in 
A world where you are not mine Fun fact: CMU has only been mentioned 23 times in the blogs, two of which are from me! I was curious, so here’s all the non-MIT colleges that are mentioned in at least 50 blog posts: Colleges that are hard to search for: Brown, because it’s also a color; BC, because it also stands for Burton Conner; Columbia, because it’s also the hometown of blogger  Elizabeth C. ’13 I said goodbye to Daniel, got on the bus, went to Gram and Daniel’s apartment, talked for a bit, went to sleep, woke up, took the bus, and saw the sunrise. At the Pittsburgh airport, I see Nathan, working on a presentation. Right, Harvard’s spring break was two weeks ago. I sleep through the flights. We arrive in Logan Airport. We take the Silver Line bus to South Station, and sit through the Boston traffic. “What did you think of the trip?” asked Nathan. “There were moments when I felt kind of out-of-place during CMIMC itself, because I didn’t know a lot of people,” I said. “But I had fun overall, seeing my friends from CMU, getting to talk to them, thinking about whether I would’ve liked going to CMU.” “Would you have liked going to CMU?” he asked. I thought about it for a bit, and I had an answer: “In another life, I think I would’ve really liked it.” EDIT: Is this post confusing? Read  17 Ridiculously Useful Tips Every Blogger Should Know

When my friends asked me what my spring break plans were, I said something along the lines of, “Oh, you know. Gonna roam around Boston :)” as if I was going to go on some grand tour. I only ended up going to like three or four locations by the time I’m writing this post, but I still had a great time! [You can click on the pics below to enlarge them] nerds I found this small sketchbook in my drawer that I impulse-bought from Central Square last spring. I only had one pencil drawing and literally nothing else in it, so I decided to fill it up with things that I’ve seen over spring break. Rogers Building (“The Small Dome”), Kresge Auditorium, Alchemist, Simmons Hall, Stata Center I get this urge to keep every page perfect whenever I use a sketchbook, hence why I intimidate myself out of using one in the first place. I didn’t worry about perfect lines or accurate details this time; I just let my imagination run loose every so often and do whatever I wanted with the source material. Anyway, someone told me that Simmons looks like the  Borg cube  and I can’t unsee it. Joseph Hooker, Massachusetts State House (and the Sacred Cod), George Washington, “Tadpole Playground” sign, “Small Child Fountain”, the “Make Way for Ducklings” statue The “MIT Bubble” is definitely a thing. As much as it’s inspiring to be around the latest research and topics in STEM, it gets exhausting when you’re getting  
fire-hosed ⁠ 01 Getting an education from MIT has been likened to taking a drink from a fire hose—the sheer number of opportunities and rigor of our coursework can leave students feeling hosed. - mitadmissions.org BTW that’s supposed to say “Temple of the Sacred Cod.” I know it looks like “Temple Sacred of the Cod.”  It’s an actual thing Benjamin Franklin’s obelisk, “Memento Mori” gravestone design, John Harvard, Charles Sumner, taxidermied pigeons, alive pigeons, turkeys A few months back, my friend at Michigan State asked me if I had pictures of skulls engraved onto tombstones. This was for her archaeology class, I think. I remembered seeing them around Boston, but I didn’t have any pics saved on my phone. I   got those pics to her, although she finished that class way back in December. I hung around Harvard Square for a little bit later that afternoon because I had nothing to do. I should’ve brought my skateboard. Red Line train interior, stuff people have written on public infrastructure I still don’t know what that grandma thing means. Fenway, Red Sox Hall-of-Famers (including Ted Williams before he got cryonically frozen), Government Center T station I still have to watch a game at Fenway! I can’t believe I haven’t gone yet! I drew this part of the sketchbook after I visited Quincy Market, which I left out because I was too tired to draw anything else and just wanted to make the blog post. I went out in my Red Sox jacket, which turned out to be a coincidence since the Park Street and Government Center stations were filled with people decked out in Red Sox gear. There happened to be a game between Baltimore and Boston (10-9) in Fenway that day. the illest villains BROCKHAMPTON (RIP the best boyband since One Direction 😔🙏) and Gorillaz have been my go-to Spotify picks lately—I’m listening to B.H.’s   as I edit this—but I wanted something fresh. Then I remembered that  Kellen whole post about MF DOOM Nothing feels more badass than letting   fill your soundscape while you’re getting to your next destination on the MBTA bus. Kellen has EXQUISITE taste. Souvenirs: MBTA pamphlet, Suzie the Grim Reaper There’s still a lot of places left in Boston that I haven’t visited—but god I love Boston so much. I really want to make a second part for this post if I get the chance.

[ Gosha It all started with a
 
dormspam. ⁠ 01 dormspam refers to emails sent out to the entire MIT undergrad population, which usually amount to advertisements of events and programs and people trying to sell clothing The idea of biking along a Eurovelo route rattled around my brain a while longer, following me through the fall. I would idly look at different routes, and eventually one in particular caught my eye: Eurovelo 8. It stretches all along the Mediterranean coast, from Spain to the Balkans. All the photos I would see from the route looked absolutely gorgeous. Plus, I had never been to Spain. That was it. I decided I wanted to bike along the Spanish coast, and that I wanted to do it over IAP. Why wait? [Kano] As for me, it all started with
 
MISTI Italy GTL. ⁠ 02 MISTI (MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives) runs global travel experiences for MIT. GTL (Global Teaching Labs) is the specific program that I was going to be a part of in Italy ophomore fall came around and, due to a series of unfortunate events, I decided to take leave for the semester. Before making this big decision, I asked
 
S^3 ⁠ 03 Student Support Services For a short while, I was pretty bummed out. I learned that, as a student on leave, I couldn’t participate in any MIT-funded programs or classes. Additionally, by the time I found this out (which was mid-November), virtually all non-MIT travel programs like interning or teaching abroad had been booked up. Every time I called, emailed, or applied to a program, I was met with no spots left for me.  By this point, I strongly considered
 
solo-backpacking Europe, ⁠ 04 Amber, a fellow blogger, has also blogged about this, linked <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-gap-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In the midst of planning my trip, with what felt like the voice of the gods, I came across an Instagram story from Gosha. The stars aligned, and so did our itineraries. I’d like to note that Gosha and I barely knew each other by this point. We had spent maybe an hour total together in-person from randomly bumping into each other on my dorm floor. In many ways, this was a risk on both of our parts, but a risk we were both willing to take.  And so our trip planning began. [Gosha] Of course, planning a bike trip on a different continent that would fit in the span of 10 or so days is a difficult task, especially when you’ve never done anything like it before. Given the ambition of the endeavor, I didn’t want to do it alone. Plus, things like this are generally more fun when there’s someone to share the memories with. Unfortunately, none of the friends I asked about maybe joining the trip seemed interested/available. Many were doing GTL, others didn’t want to bike, etc. Finally, growing a bit desperate, I decided to post a story on my Instagram, asking if anyone might be interested. Surprisingly, the story got a lot of replies – most of them commenting on what a cool idea it was and wishing me luck, though the people themselves couldn’t make it. One person, though, seemed interested – Kano. Previous Next Over the course of a couple of weeks, Kano and I set up a series of video calls over which we ironed out the details of the trip. Kano wanted to go to Italy, and I had never been. So why not join her? We decided we would first go to Italy to see different cities and then to Spain, where we would bike along the coast. Specifically, I wanted to bike from Barcelona to Valencia. I had heard that this stretch was absurdly beautiful, and it seemed to fall neatly on the EuroVelo 8 route. The problem was, it’s hard to estimate how long you can bike for when you’ve never quite done anything similar, and all you have to work with are Google Maps and your own estimating abilities. Between the uncertainty in what the trip would look like, our desire to see more cities in
 
Spain, ⁠ 05 Madrid, anyone? The final piece of the trip came together when my friend Selena expressed interest in joining the biking. Selena would be spending IAP with the
 
Spanish incubator ⁠ 06 an MIT literature class taught in Spain every IAP and  go to Paris. In the end, I decided I would get to Italy later than Kano and only see
 
Milan, ⁠ 07 and, spontaneously, Venice, but we’ll get to that after  Spain, while Kano would fly back to Boston. Thus, a relatively simple idea turned into a race to see as much of Europe as possible in two weeks… [Kano] We had so much going on with this trip so, accordingly, we needed a planning platform that could handle a lot. I remember starting off in a very rough Google doc with Selena and Gosha and thinking,   “this would be so much better in
 
Notion. ⁠ 08 all-in-one notetaking and productivity platform Previous Next I need to gush over Notion more. With the first tab of our planning database, you can see everything that’s going on. With the following three tabs, each category of planning is separated: the “Transportation” tab laid out how we planned to get around each day, the “Lodging” tab laid out where we would sleep every night, and the “Funsies” tab laid out all of our activities. This allowed us to easily catch any gaps in our planning. We also attached screenshots of all the bookings we made into each applicable entry of the calendar. The final tab houses personal itineraries that were automatically generated from the group itinerary, which I find so mentally satisfying. With no stone left unturned, we were ready to embark on this adventure. [Kano] From the US to Italy, I went! Even while I was in the  Las Vegas airport , this entire trip felt surreal. It couldn’t have been happening for someone like me. As a first-generation, low-income student, I never fathomed being able to go on a trip like this for my entire life. It always felt out of reach, something that I could only daydream about. I had always wanted to see the world, but didn’t know quite how. For IAP, my inner child was truly over the moon. packed up and ready to go! On the  plane , I made friends with the person sitting next to me: a fellow university student who happened to be a Roman local. She gave me some wonderfully specific recommendations: order the Negroni Sbagliato from the bar On the Rox, wander to a cute cafe and order a Cornetto with a cappuccino for breakfast, and so on. It’s nice to see a place through the eyes of someone who lives and breathes it. As they say, “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.” [Kano] In search of things to do in  Rome , I browsed Google Maps and noticed line art symbols that accompanied notable locations all over the city. In short, there were historical marvels  everywhere . Certainly, sites like these existed in the US, but I had never seen such a deep concentration of beautiful places on my phone map before.  the rain paints the ground in reflection My suitcase wheels were met with old, beaten  Roman tile . Lugging a checked bag, carry-on, and filled backpack was not the vibe. If you ever go on a hostel-centered trip, I highly recommend only having a carry-on. The main reason I had my checked bag was because I was traveling to MIT immediately afterward, but knowing what I know now, I would’ve asked around more diligently for someone else to take my checked bag. Hostels, at least all the ones I stayed at, offered lockers that could only fit carry-ons anyways. While trudging through the rain with all of my heavy belongings, I felt, in a funny way, cinematic. Anyways, I made it to my hostel, settled in, napped, and prepared for a fun evening. Previous Next First, I visited the  Trevi Fountain . It was still raining, and that added to the water of the fountain feeling more alive. The sea foam blue color against the yellowed stone looked stunning.  Oceanus, Greek sea God and uncle of Poseidon, is depicted in the center in a baroque-style sculpture Second, I visited the  Pantheon . That was brief. I thought the towers looked cool and partly wished I had more time, but I knew I had to move on with my night to meet a friend before joining a group dinner.  looks just like the Jefferson Memorial <3 Third, I met up with
  Concourse. ⁠ 09 In my freshman year, I was a part of this freshman learning community centered around blending STEM and humanities through philosophical discussion. 4 people around me, including myself, got the exact same dish: a yummy carbonara January 19th: Rome → Florence  Alright, Rome Day 2! Roman breakfast was light and cute, a perfect accompaniment to people-watching from the hotel window. this apple was scrumptious First, I did the most quintessential tourist-in-Rome thing and visited the  Colosseum . I kept imagining what it would’ve been like to witness shows and fights from the audience. This was their “television,” where they, too, tuned into different shows and let their minds be entertained.  Previous Next Unbeknownst to me until the night prior, the Colosseum ticket also granted access to two other places. Next, I headed to  Palatine Hill , the mythical founding place of Rome and  The Roman Forum,  where citizens used to carry out day-to-day shopping and officials would hold public affairs (law courts, public meetings, gladiatorial combats, etc). Previous Next Originally, I was going to head directly to Milan to meet Gosha and Selena, but decided to leave a day early from Rome to spend a night in  Florence . It was on the way, anyways. Late into the night, after arriving in Florence, I grabbed my first Italian pizza, accompanied with a beer and viewing of football. I ended my night at a hostel, which had the most mirrors and the biggest bathtub I’d seen of the whole trip. I was so surprised to find this in the corner of the hostel. That night, my hostel mates and I sat in a small circle of five on the wooden floor, where we shared hostel pointers and fragments of our travel stories. It felt like a kind community—I slept well that night. Previous Next January 20th: Florence → Milan Florence quietly tapped me awake with its quaint sounds and soft light. By morning, I still couldn’t believe that I was in the birthplace of the Renaissance. Like, what? I wanted to see the city wholly, or at least get as close to that goal as I could, so I set three goals for that day: cross a cool bridge, stare at a cathedral, and explore any museum. One of my friends had been to Florence before, so I referred to the travel spreadsheet that she had sent me and a few Google searches to inform my own itinerary. I started my morning with mushroom ragu and a glass of rose. At that  , I was the first customer of the day and had the place to myself—sweet quietness. American love songs played as I ate and looked through the window to watch the calm flow of the river. As much as I love dining with others, there is something special about my solo meals. Because my mind can focus more on the dining experience in-and-of-itself rather than whoever I may be eating with, every sensory experience is more intense: the flavors stronger, smells sharper, and sights more charming.  an excellent wine/pasta pairing It was easy to wander and marvel at the ornate architecture and impressive collection of statues. I spent most of my time around  Loggia dei Lanzi , a 14th-century building that’s home to a ceremonial open-air gallery of Renaissance sculptures. Every other corner had something absolutely stunning to look at that it felt like I didn’t even have to actively find a museum because the entire city   one. Walking through a narrow alley, I eventually stumbled upon a  . I bought wax seals and cards, because I enjoy mailing notes to my friends and the store offered wonderful designs. Something is so cute about spending a few extra minutes to close off an envelope with a wax emblem. Previous Next Next, I had to cross the  Ponte Vecchio  the coolest bridge in Florence)—I just had to. Local shops, food vendors, and people lined the entirety of it. It was a peculiar site: the bridge acted less like a liminal space and more like a place brimming with life. Around here, for the first and last time of my Europe trip, I bumped into a hostel mate. It made sense, as we were both tourists exploring the city, but there was nonetheless a serendipity in that moment. We shared our itineraries for the evening and moved on.  the light posts had interesting feet I got lost finding the  Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore , so when I did end up finding it, the view of it hit me like whiplash. It was absolutely insane. None of my photos do it justice. It grips your gaze from afar and pulls you closer. Every time I looked at it, it appeared different. From my first gaze, it was a monolithically beautiful sight. As I took a few steps closer, it became an epic of many tales. In total and utter awe of the cathedral, I realized that I had never experienced this type of aesthetic allure before. Every time I tried to leave, I couldn’t help but turn back. Previous Next That was the last stop of my Florence excursion. I headed back to my hostel, grabbed my bags, and took a train out to Milan to finally meet Gosha. January 20th: Boston → Milan  Every time I go to Europe it feels like a revelation. I can’t pinpoint the exact reason, either. I think a big part of it is just urbanism – the places I like to go in Europe are large, dense cities with diverse and often beautiful architecture, which just happen to be my favorite type of place. I feel most at ease in a big city where I can get lost in the crowd, where no one pays me any attention but I can people-watch at my own leisure. I  love  public transport and seeing how its designed in every new city I visit. There aren’t that many places in the US that fit this bill. But it’s more than just the city structure. Something about being anywhere in Europe feels familiar and right; I suspect it has to do with being raised in a European culture, albeit one quite different from Italy or Spain or any of the other places I’ve traveled to recently. Or it could all be a sample bias of being on break from college, the freedom of travel, etc. My bet is on all of the above. I thought I looked a little cool taking the T to the airport with my big backpack This is all to say that when I stepped out of the Milan airport, I was in an incredibly good mood. I had flown in on a red-eye flight, meaning I had the whole day ahead of me, which only lifted my spirits. Kano’s train to Milan was originally supposed to come in only a couple of hours after my flight. However, after a series of misfortunes, her arrival was delayed to sometime in the evening, so I ended up spending the day alone wandering around the city. I love wandering cities alone. It’s grounding, in a counterintuitive sort of way. Faced with the rush of things and people, I am reminded of the reality of my existence. It’s too easy for me to get caught up in my studies, my research, whatever drama is going on in my life. But stepping out onto a bustling street, forcing myself to walk with my thoughts… it gives me perspective. So that’s exactly what I did: I walked around and I thought about my life. It was lovely and very necessary. One of the researchers in my UROP group is from Milan, and he gave me a ton of recommendations before I left Boston. Following his descriptions of the character of different neighborhoods, I walked around, admiring the architecture and observing the people. I had never been to Italy before, and for some reason wasn’t fully convinced that it’s as… Italian as it’s made out to be. Turns out, yes, Italy is in fact
 
very Italian. ⁠ 10 no, I can’t explain this feeling better. iykyk, i guess Previous Next Much later in the evening, when Kano finally made it to the hostel, we went out for a late dinner. Being the college students that we are, we sought out the cheapest and closest option we could find. This turned out to be an incredible cafe with the
 
cheapest, ⁠ 11 just 8 euros for a big portion!! Previous Next January 21st: Milan → Venice → Milan  As a 7-hour round trip commute,   was  so  out of the way, but it was Venice, so we had to go. Accordingly, we dedicated a full day to visit. Isaac L. ‘25, one of my other friends that I had convinced to do GTL, met up with Gosha and I in Milan before we embarked on this trip together. The three of us took a lovely train over land and water to reach our destination: Venice, an island city constructed on a group of 118 small islands that are partitioned by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. It sounds straight out of a fiction novel. As someone from Las Vegas, I kept exclaiming “wow, this is so much better than the
 
Vegas version!” ⁠ 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venetian_Las_Vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Venetian Resort</a> Previous Next First things first: food. Gosha led the way to lunch. On the way, we stumbled upon this one  honor-code shop . There were no store clerks, only items strewn across the windowsills and a box on the ground for payment. It was endearing: battered books, yellowed postcards, and miscellaneous trinkets. The three of us made our selections, tossed in our coins, and proceeded to lunch. We decided to pair our  seafood-filled meal  with two glasses of aperol spritz, partly because it’s an excellent drink but mostly because it originated in Padua, only a 30 min train ride from Venice. Things taste better closer to home. One of our table centerpieces was a mystery plant, and, because our group couldn’t figure out what it was, I decided to take a bite. This was the start of the end—I’ll come back to this point in a bit.  Previous Next After our delicious meal, we headed to  Basilica S.Maria Gloriosa dei Frari , the largest church in Venice. On the way, we walked in awe of the still, teal canals and adorable architecture. It was all so strange to see no cars, only boats. We stumbled upon a set of stairs that led down to the Venetian waters, and I dipped my hands in. We eventually made it to the church. This was, perhaps, the most grand religious building I saw in Italy. The red was so deep, gold so shimmery, and stone so bare. Inside, goth was clearly kept alive with a wide array of pieces honoring that culture. Partaking in Catholic culture, I paid a euro to light a candle for my grandmother. Previous Next Afterwards, we waited in line to enter  ​​Saint Mark’s Basilica . At this point, I started to feel a bit funny. My mind span and stomach churned. I felt a physical pain emanate throughout my body that I had never experienced before. I told Gosha and Isaac that I “wanted to be horizontal” and swiftly headed to the nearest bench. I laid flat and felt marginally better. When Gosha and Isaac were told the cathedral line had already closed, they walked over to my decimated self and asked if I was okay. I wasn’t. Lifting my head made me nauseous and walking was very difficult. In an effort to get to our train station ASAP, we decided to take the ferry over instead of getting there by foot.  the cathedral that we didn’t get to enter, but at least admired from the outside The night sharply turned grim aboard the  ferry . It was packed: a middle aged woman to my right, elderly Italian couple in front of me, and Isaac to my left. The tossing and turning of the boat made my head spin. I told Isaac “I don’t want to throw up,” as if to set a comically bad prophecy for what came next. Remember the meal that I had mentioned was the start of the end? Here’s the end: in one swift movement, just seconds later, I grabbed the tapestry that I had bought out of its paper bag, chucked it at Isaac, felt a ~whoosh~ in my tummy, and violently projectile-vomited directly into the now-emptied gift bag. Multiple times. So many abdominal contractions. (Isaac wanted me to add that this undersells how intensely my body was moving. It was like every fiber of my being was being contracted, head to toe.) Think: Total Drama Island throw up. I felt so bad for myself, but mostly for the other ferry goers. Their stares of pity fell onto me. And, my gosh, of course the paper of the bag eventually ripped and the bag of vomit just had to sit under my seat in a sad blob. There was no public trash can aboard, so we all sat in awkward tension. That was the longest ferry ride of my life.  Upon arriving at the  train station , Gosha and Isaac searched for our train while I went to use the restroom. I thought that my sickness was over, but I felt a rumbling rise in me once again. 20 minutes passed. At that point, Gosha and Isaac called to check on me, inform me that our train would arrive in 4 minutes, and ask if I could make it. I told them that I was throwing up again, knees down on the restroom floor and elbows on the seat. I need not bore nor disgust you further with the details. Mustering up all the physical willpower I had left, I said yes to boarding the next train, cleaned up, and headed out.  We sat in the very back row, with me in front of this one dude, Isaac facing the aisle, and Gosha sitting in front of someone else. A few minutes passed, and I felt that I was in the clear. Peace at last. But, I was wrong. I was, once again, going through the motions and promptly gestured to Isaac to help find a bag. In panic, he handed me a plastic one. The man sitting in front of me looked forward with such horror in his eyes; I felt sorry for him. This was the third, and thankfully final, time. After an hour, I reached a stable state and asked around for a napkin. A sweet man frantically searched his bag and kindly gave me his dense pack of tissues. I freshened up, took a deep breath, and was finally able to nap. A few hours later, we made it to our  hostel in Milan  and rested. I spent the next few days eating “safe” foods so as to not upset my stomach. It felt so silly walking into a grocery store, ripping a single banana from its cluster, and buying it. What had to be done was done.  After a few more days, I felt I was back at normal digestion and finally moved on with my life. I was still surprised that this whole ordeal occurred because up until that point, I had never had food poisoning before. I’ve always had a strong stomach, I think largely due to the conditioning of my volatile Thai diet. That was the second worst physical pain I had experienced in my entire life, and I was just glad it was over. That incident was one for the books (or, I guess, a blog). January 22nd: Milan → Barcelona  Previous Next On the afternoon of our last day in Milan, our group split up. As Kano went to search for a dress for
 
ring delivery, ⁠ 13 a big fancy event where the sophomores receive their class ring, called a brass rat 
changed ⁠ 14 if we’re being honest, I think I just grew up and my taste evolved Previous Next That same evening, we had to catch a bus to Barcelona. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite travel “hacks”: instead of wasting a day traveling, I take a night bus from point A to point B. That way, I sleep on the bus, so no need to pay for a night at a hostel. Plus, it’s cheaper than a flight or a train, and takes longer, which is good if you’re trying to get a
 
full night’s sleep. ⁠ 15 not that you will get it, since sleeping on a bus is ultimately not that comfortable interesting aesthetic in the night bus Our bus left Milan at around 8 pm and got into Barcelona the next morning. Busses feel very down-to-Earth, as far as modes of long-distance travel go. I guess this is true literally, since busses are relatively slow. But I mean it metaphorically, also:  because  they are slow, it feels like you actually pass through the places you drive past. Every couple of hours or so I would wake up from my (admittedly not super comfortable) sleep, check Google maps, and appreciate the progress we had made–first out of Italy and through the Alps, then past Grenoble and further on, across the south of France. Thus, although it was night, and I only exited the bus at some truckers’ rest stop, I really do feel like I  was  in those places, if only in passing. At some point towards the morning, I woke up from my latest round of sleep and was startled by both the fact that it was light outside and that right outside of my window was a huge mountain, lit in soft pinkish tones by the sunrise. Waking up to that after a long night of fitful sleep, being surrounded by beautiful scenery and just hearing the silence of the morning was almost a spiritual experience. I genuinely cannot find the words to describe it. I refused to go back to sleep after that, so I just spent the rest of the bus ride watching the sun climb up over the Pyrenees. I woke up to this! Final Words  That concludes the Italy leg of our trip.  We hit four cities, each with their own charm:   felt ancient,   felt romantic,   felt cozy, and   felt grand. None of these adjectives do each of the places justice, but they together help paint a fuller picture of Italy. Stay tuned for part 2: Spain and France! #biking #europe #GTL (Global Teaching Labs) #italy #spain #travel

It has been 13 days since Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour began so in honor of that, I am ranking my favorite three songs (I can’t pick one) in alphabetical order (yes, I cannot pick one) from each of her albums and will be making up more categories as I go. I am excited to see what you think, so talk to me in the comments!  Reputation This was the first Taylor album that I started really listening to and liking last summer. It is still my favorite album and I stand by the claim that it has no skippable songs.  will never not be a banger opening song.  I also really liked the   and   vibe of songs. The live performances for these songs were incredible but also empowering for Taylor, which is really cool.   seems to have a story and I think it is really cool
 
to tell a story through a song.  ⁠ 01 in today’s episode of fatima discovers musicals (no but this is different yep)  is a really good one. The  music video I think the love songs on this album are all really good. Someone said that Reputation is not an album about revenge but really, finding love in dark times and I never thought about it like that before.   is such a mellow end to this album that is sometimes loving and sometimes vengeful but mostly always loud.  You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi  I can tell that it’s gonna be a long road I’ll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe  Or if you strike out and you’re crawling home HELLO??? Favorite Songs Delicate, Don’t Blame Me, New Year’s Day Lover Lover was the second album that I started listening to. This album has an overall happy, soft, purple-pink (but in a good way) feel to it. As a writer, it always seems like great tragedies are worth writing. I find it easier to write sadder pieces but I don’t think I have ever done justice to a happy piece so I really appreciate this album for discovering beauty in happiness, sometimes in the most mundane of things, for being golden, like daylight.   was my most played song last year and what about it. I would scream its bridge (for whatever its worth) every day. The love songs on this album called Lover are, of course, all so beautiful.   itself is such a beautiful song. I love when she uses very overused phrases in her songs in some clever way. In  , she says  In  , she says: All the king’s horses and all the king’s men  Couldn’t put me together again  ‘Cause all of my enemies started out friends  which is such a CLEVER reference.  are all so different and so good in their own ways. Special shoutout to   because I’D NEVER WALK CORNELIA STREET AGAAAAINNN. I have heard a lot of hate on   and   but I personally don’t dislike them. Probably not the best, but still pretty good!   and   are weirdly intertwined but also different IDK. In a sense, the lyrics to   are very straightforward but it draws its strength from that. It says things which are difficult to say very simply and clearly.  and   oops.   is also pretty so-so. Favorite Songs Afterglow, Cornelia Street, The Archer Underrated  I Think He Knows (I discovered this song through this  Lavender Haze x I Think He Knows mashup )  folklore  folklore arguably has some of Taylor’s most beautiful lyricism. The   trilogy goes back to the idea of telling a story through song but now that story is being told through three different perspectives in these three songs. If I had to rank them, I would probably do   or   and everyone is gonna come for the   hate but I swear I like it, I just like the other ones more, sobbing and crying.  I slept on  the 1  for a very long time but I have come to really like it. It also ties with  hoax , the last track on the album really well. The transition from  But it would’ve been fun If you would’ve been the one to  My only one My smoking gun My eclipsed sun This has broken me down But also, this AAAAAAA Stood on the cliffside Screaming, “Give me a reason” Your faithless love’s the only hoax I believe in Don’t want no other shade of blue But you No other sadness in the world would do  is so underrated but one of my favorites off folklore. Like yes, would it be enough if I could never give you peace? would it? would it… I should write my close reading paper for my Modern Poetry class on this song.   was one of my most listened to songs last year too. When talking about this song, Taylor says,  And they called off the circus Burned the disco down When they sent home the horses And the rodeo clowns I’m still on that tightrope I’m still trying everything to get you laughing at me I’m still a believer but I don’t know why I’ve never been a natural All I do is try, try, try I’m still on that trapeze I’m still trying everything To keep you looking at me  and   are also some of my favorites.   always feels like a conversation to me except neither person is being heard which is so heartbreaking. All this time I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind) I couldn’t turn things around (you never turned things around) ‘Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) So many signs, so many signs You didn’t even see the signs the lyricism in   is so poetic! instead of saying words, i will just cite (yes, this is very technical) some of her lyrics.  We gather stones, never knowing what they’ll mean Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring And I can go anywhere I want Anywhere I want, just not home And you can aim for my heart, go for blood But you would still miss me in your bones And I still talk to you (when I’m screaming at the sky) And when you can’t sleep at night (you hear my stolen lullabies) I didn’t have it in myself to go with grace And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same Cursing my name, wishing I stayed You turned into your worst fears And you’re tossing out blame, drunk on this pain Crossing out the good years And you’re cursing my name, wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet hoax, illicit affairs, invisible string, mirrorball, my tears ricochet, peace, this is me trying  (this is three songs, right? right? modulo 4 yep!)  evermore i had a feeling so peculiar that this pain would be for evermore. I was such a  folklore is better  girl and Prajna N. ‘25 told me I had bad takes and that I was a disgrace to humanity (I might be paraphrasing that, just a little bit). I started listening to evermore at some point and every song is so beautiful. In its essence, it is a sad album but every song is a different color of sad. Here is a  fun(ny) reel  to watch.  is the story of breaking someone’s heart,   is about continuously giving in a relationship just to be tolerated in return,   is about collecting yourself to find perspective and well, happiness after losing a relationship,   is about realizing someone’s value after you lost them,   is mourning the death of a loved one. It is also a very strong album in terms of its lyricism so as a poet, I am obviously a fan.  Now, to put on my literary critic monocle, starting with  !  How’s one to know? I’d meet you where the spirit meets the bones In a faith forgotten land In from the snow Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow Tarnished but so grand And the old widow goes to the stone every day But I don’t, I just sit here and wait Grieving for the living Just this beginning stanza is so poetic. Another one of my favorite lines is  ‘My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand.’  Then, Taylor really breaks my soul in two with  . It seems to have the same conversation format as in  but is a lot more murky in that I really can’t tell who was in the wrong. Noteworthy lyrics: The question pounds my head What’s a lifetime of achievement If I pushed you to the edge But you were too polite to leave me? Do you miss the rogue Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there? Will you forgive my soul When you’re too wise to trust me and too old to care?  And when I got into the accident The sight that flashed before me was your face But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name  is one of my favorite sad songs. It feels deeply intertwined with   in some way I can’t really place.   is very different from all these sad songs but is such a classic and the  music video  is so good!  both the bonus tracks are also incredibly good. just the transition of i am   to   is so witty.  coney island, ivy, tolerate it evermore, gold rush, right where you left me 1989 Given that this might be her most famous album, I came around to it really late. Most of the songs on here are really good. Even just  , it is like listening to a kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats.  You have the classics  , classics for a reason.   was one of the first Taylor Swift songs I really liked and still is one of my favorites.   and started saying   which is incredible.

keep MIT running In 2014, Walter Isaacson published a book named “The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution”. It’s rated 4.6  on Amazon made a joke Philippine science fairs, back in my day, always had “innovation” as their highest-weighted judging criterion. A  national science fair announcement When I went to  a party in SF AngelList YC Co-Founder Matching The Pitch Portal CoFoundersLab Fundsup 3linepitch Appian Mendix Zoho Creator OAuth I don’t remember what their answers were, but I do remember that I wasn’t convinced. Now, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making your own solution, if you find the existing ones lacking. I’ve done this myself with  qboard my thought process before Things tend to stick around longer than anyone expects. Consider the  ESP website It has been 17 years, and the ESP website stands unchanged. Five years? A ten year “upper limit”? They had the right mindset of thinking about future website developers, but they didn’t get close to guessing how long the website would last. Consider another example,  Building 20 “the duration of the war and six months thereafter” Why did Building 20 take 55 years before it got demolished? Why are we still using the same codebase for the ESP website, 17 years later? Partly because of how expensive it is to replace something so large, in both time and money. If I had to guess, a bigger reason would be because so much depends on these systems. Running any of ESP’s programs at our  thousand student scale In time, the cost of maintaining these systems becomes too high. There’s parts of ESP’s website that no one in ESP understands, and developers are afraid of making big changes in fear of breaking it. The  asbestos hazards I talk so much about the student groups I help run that I sometimes forget why I’m with these groups in the first place. In my  second blog post I cared about them enough Ever since I wrote about  gift economies in the puzzlehunt context As with the puzzlehunt or fandom gift economies, not everyone who joins a Guild game or comes to Squares will do one of these things, and that’s okay. Some people won’t have the resources to do more than come, and that’s okay. There’s groups that I take from more than I give to, like how I go to  SaveTFP Lab for Chocolate Science International Students Association I’ve talked to some people who think that the only way they can show “leadership skills” is by being the president of something, or that expressing  initiative and risk-taking delegation, tracking deadlines, and running meetings first virtual program Maybe replacement is inevitable. When Building 20 was constructed, most people weren’t aware of asbestos’s health hazards. There’s always that unknown unknown that you couldn’t have foreseen, that unpredictable disaster you can’t recover from, or some fundamentally broken part of whatever system. And in that case, then yes, we need founders. We need people who’ll create new solutions, people who’ll make whatever invention to fill the gap. I don’t want to give people the impression that I’m against innovation. There’s lots of cases when founding something is the right thing to do, and this is one of them. And if you make something that’s meant to last for a short time, like a one-off event that’ll never run again, there’s no need to think about maintenance. But if you want to start an event that’ll run every year, you need to think about   it’ll run every year. My favorite examples of making things that’ll last for years are from software and architecture. For whatever reason, there’s a lot of similar ideas in designing websites and designing buildings, like how I talked about the ESP website and Building 20. I first learned this connection through  a Twitter thread in the MIT Software Design Group How Buildings Learn shearing layers There’s a lot that’s been written about writing maintainable software, like  Big Ball of Mud Worse is Better The Cathedral and the Bazaar watch on YouTube read the text of Guy Steele I stand on this claim: I should not design a small language, and I should not design a large one. I need to design a language that can grow. I need to plan ways in which it might grow—but I need, too, to leave some choices so that other persons can make those choices at a later time. These thoughts influenced how I designed  Hydrant Firehose taught in web.lab 6.102 Software Construction Hydrant is open source. Anyone can look at the Github repo and submit a pull request to get something changed. In theory, if there’s an issue or request that enough people want, one of those people would fix or add it themselves. In practice, this doesn’t happen, because would-be contributors don’t know how or don’t have enough time. Design can only go so far: good maintainers can make up for bad design, but good design can never make up for a lack of maintainers. This is where  SIPB many roles in our many projects These ideas aren’t new. In  Breaking apart the monolith swyx You could call it passing the torch. But torches remind me of burning out, like how I once  burned out doing work for my student groups We give advice we wish we could’ve told our past selves. While it’s true that being older made me think about maintenance more, you don’t have to wait until you’re older before you start thinking about it too. It reminds me of  Choose Boring Technology Here, then, is my advice. Want to change something? Find the role that’ll best let   do so. If that means starting something, then that’s great, do it. But you don’t have to be a founder. You might have more impact as a maintainer. I’m graduating in two months. Did I leave my mark on MIT as a maintainer? Did I leave things better than I found them? Did I leave the lights on for the people who’ll take my place? I don’t know. I tried my best. I might be leaving, but I’ll still be available for advice, in the same way that  others have been available for me To Alyssa S. ’24, Colin C. ’26, Diana S. ’25, Julia C. ’25, Lumia N. ’24, and the many, many others I don’t have space to list, I hope I made your job easier, and if not, I hope I didn’t make it harder. I hope that you help maintain the communities and groups I’m leaving behind. I hope that you one day leave the lights on for someone else to maintain them. And I hope you find more joy in your work than I’ve ever had.

When I was applying to be a blogger in September, one of the first questions was about why I wanted to be a blogger in the first place. Amidst feeling a bit of déjà vu and lasting trauma from college application essays, I answered (in 250 words or less) that
 
blogging would be an excuse ⁠ 01 i don't think this statement can be true when i rarely blog in the first place... oops. Having been talking to other class of 2026 adMITs since December and attended the First Year Arts Program FPOP, I was well aware that there was much more to MIT culture than just being a tech school. I’d already met so many fellow frosh with interests in painting and dance and crochet and cooking, already been acquainted with the various music and arts clubs around campus before my first day of class even started.  Still, I’ve put myself in the box of being an “art kid” for so long, and I was afraid that going to a STEM school would irreparably change that part of me. I was afraid that I  would lose touch with a part of myself that has always been a defining part of my life . I was afraid I really  would  have trouble continuing to pursue art while attending an “Institute of Technology.” A semester and a half later, I can say I was more or less right. You’d expect an art major to be making a lot of art, but despite taking two design classes and having a UROP focused on animation, I didn’t actually create a lot of art during first semester. I didn’t have time to draw for fun other than a few sketches during the
 
first week, ⁠ 02 i was disappointed to discover MIT doesn't really do the whole “syllabus week” thing, but in hindsight i should not have taken my lack of stress for granted. i had no idea what was in store for me. Previous Next Even the art I  did  make in my design classes isn’t really what I’d call art; it was more me struggling to learn how to use 3D modeling programs and messing around in the woodshop and making clumsy MechE adjacent crafts.
 
Course 4 ⁠ 03 course 4 is architecture, and course 4b is art and design, which is what i'm planning on majoring in. Previous Next But first semester eventually came to a close, and winter break began, and I suddenly, surprisingly, found that I was no longer in a period of artistic drought. For once, I had motivation, a restless energy to put pen to paper (or Apple pencil to Paperlike screen protector), and best of all, reasons to draw. After all, it was December, which meant gift-giving season :).  Previous Next These gifts included Christmas gifts,
 
birthday gifts ⁠ 04 although technically this was made in February not December, the winter months are such a continuous slog that i say it counts 
DAAMIT ⁠ 05 Digital Art At MIT, a club focusing on, you guessed it, digital art My aforementioned online art friends also held an event where we all made art based on each others’ song suggestions! Below are some doodles based on the song  “On Melancholy Hill” Previous Next I was also really looking forward to allocating time towards making art during  IAP! glassblowing class 
10-250 ⁠ 06 one of the more famous lecture halls on campus, situated in lobby 10 under The Dome! However, I did manage to sign up for some  Student Art Association (SAA) Over the course of four weeks, I got to spend allocated time turning my brain off and just letting my hands do their thing.  Conveniently, just as IAP ended, a pipe burst (or something like that) in the Student Center, effectively holding my painting and mug hostage in the fourth floor SAA rooms.
 07 this was originally my excuse for waiting to write this blog, but the stud has been back in commission for at least a couple weeks now, so... Previous Next I still don’t make as much art as I wish I could, but this semester has been a lot better than the last. It’s nice to know that the balance between being an artist and a student at an “Institute of Technology” is a delicate one, not an impossible one. I’m still holding on to that burst of motivation to create, and I’m excited to see where that takes me.  #4.500 #artsatmit #i definitely don't have a lasting distate for chairs #IAP #studentartassociation

Introduction Before coming to college, I often wondered how hard MIT was. Conversations with current students led me to believe that MIT’s hardness ranged from “quite” to “extraordinarily”; some even described it as “pretty damn hard”. However, these conversations always lacked the one thing my inner engineer craved most – numbers. Without objective measurements backing up these results, how could I trust their accuracy, let alone use them in future experiments? Which hardness scale do these results even refer to? And don’t even get me started on the lack of units. I shudder as I think of all the unsuspecting high-school students making important life decisions based on this questionable data. And to think that MIT calls itself an engineering school! Luckily, all that is about to change. Thanks to MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), I have the perfect tools to conduct a quantitative analysis of MIT’s hardness. Background But first, let me address a question that’s undoubtedly burning in your mind right now – what exactly is hardness? Merriam-Webster defines hardness as “the cohesion of the particles on the surface of a mineral as determined by its capacity to scratch another or be itself scratched” [1]. In simpler terms, harder materials are more difficult to scratch and dent. There are several different scales used to quantify hardness. The most well-known is the Mohs hardness scale – an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond) where material X ranks above material Y if X can scratch Y [2]. Figure 1 – Mohs hardness scale for some common materials [2]. A slightly more sophisticated scale is the Vickers hardness scale, which measures the size of an indentation made by a diamond pressing on the measured material [3]. Measurements made with this method have units of HV. Figure 2 – Schematic of the Vickers hardness test [5]. Materials and Methods I asked several MIT students about what they believe makes MIT hard. From this survey, I concluded that the chief contributing factor to MIT’s hardness is its notoriously rigorous schoolwork. I further broke down this schoolwork into four subcategories: Homework assignments (also known as “psets”). Exams. Lab assignments and design projects. Majors as a whole. Based on these four subcategories, I collected five different samples to test: My 3.020 (thermodynamics of materials) psets from this semester. My 6.1220 (design and analysis of algorithms) midterm exam from last semester. The 6.1910 (computation structures) design project from spring 2009. A stack of sticky notes I received from the Department of Chemical Engineering. A plastic highlighter I received from the Department of Chemistry. Figure 3 – The samples I used, arranged left to right. To test these samples, I used a Vickers indenter (generously provided by the DMSE in their all-new “Breakerspace” opening in July) to measure their Vickers hardnesses. To correct for human error, I took three measurements for each sample using the indenter and used the average as my final reported measurement. Figure 4 – The Vickers indenter with a sample loaded. I then used ad-hoc tests such as Mohs hardness tests to confirm my results. Results and Discussion First, I tested my 3.020 psets. Thermodynamics is one of the most challenging classes I’ve taken so far at MIT because of how unintuitive the concepts are, and the homework certainly reflects that… but exactly how  hard  are the psets? Immediately after I loaded the sample into the Vickers indenter and pressed “measure” to find out, I encountered my first problem – no indentation was visible, even after repeated measurements! This result meant one of two possibilities: The sample was harder than a diamond… Or it was so soft that all indentations sprang back (like a flat marshmallow). Figure 6 – No visible indentation. I then bent the psets without them shattering, meaning they were ductile. This result suggests that the second possibility is the most likely. For now, though, I left my lab notebook blank. Next, I tested my 6.1220 midterm exam. The median score for this exam was 61 out of 120 – by all measures, the most difficult exam I’ve taken so far at MIT… but all that is irrelevant when measuring material hardness. Once again, however, the results from the indenter were inconclusive. At this point, I was rather desperate to get some numerical data, so I attributed these disappointing results to the fact that 6.1220 dealt with  soft ware. Surely, I asked myself, the 6.1910 design project – a project centred around designing efficient  hard ware – would yield better results? Unsurprisingly, the design project (along with the chemical engineering sticky notes) sprang back like marshmallows. Could this be why there have been no previous quantitative studies on MIT’s hardness? Is the measurement process simply too complex for a silly little undergraduate like me to perform? I considered giving up here, but I still had one remaining sample to measure, so I pressed onward. As I pressed “measure”, I held my breath and crossed my fingers. As the microscope slowly focused on the sample, the impossible happened – a faint impression of a square appeared on the computer screen. I could finally extract a numerical measurement! Figure 7 – A visible indentation at last. I then made two more measurements and extracted a hardness value of 194 HV for the highlighter. This value is roughly the hardness of polypropylene [4] (which makes sense if you think about it). In my excitement, I gripped hard on the stack of previous samples I was holding. To my surprise and delight, my fingernails scratched them, which reminded me of another tool I had at my disposal – the Mohs hardness scale! Knowing this, I grabbed a nearby pencil and piece of chalk and measured 1.5 on the Mohs hardness scale for all four samples. These values correspond to roughly 20 HV – an order of magnitude off from the highlighter’s hardness value, though that data point might be an outlier. Conclusion MIT, with a median Vickers hardness value of about 20 HV, is about as hard as paper. In other words, not very hard at all. Figure 8 – MIT vs. other materials on the Vickers hardness scale. Note that this is plotted on a log scale. All numbers presented in this blog post are rough estimates, so take them with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, this post is a big step in the right direction, and the findings presented here will open the door for future studies about the hardnesses of different colleges.

Every year, for as long as the blogs have been around, we post  open threads what happens after you don’t get into MIT.  From @Wox For all those waitlisted, here is some thoughts from the other side of the veil: 
I applied EA to MIT a few years ago, got deferred, then waitlisted. When the regular decision came out I remember feeling dreadful that I would have to wait another 2 months, and treated it as a rejection with prolonged pain. What I didn’t know is that those 2 months allowed me to discard a single vision of my future and evaluate what it was I wanted out of college, taught me to be able to see myself elsewhere, and when my MIT waitlist decision came back, it felt more on equal standing. When receiving your MIT decision today, it might have seemed as though you were waiting to see whether MIT would give you a chance. It felt as though there was everything to lose, all the work you put in, the years, the sleepless nights. Seek joy in your other opportunities, I promise this decision is not going to be as painful for as long as you think. It was freeing, in a way, to be able to seek new dreams, create new hopes; MIT had been my dream for so long. I felt like a new version of myself, less tied to what my long term plan was, and more open to the possibilities. New cities, new paths unfolded, and MIT was out of the picture. It allowed me to more fully understand myself, outside of the image I had painted in my head. Your 20 year plan? scrap it. It won’t help you. In late May, part way through a drive home from one of my last days of high school, I unceremoniously opened my waitlist decision on my cellphone in the Dunkin’ Donuts parking lot; just opening it to have it done, with my car keys brightly decorated with a keychain from the college I chose to commit to in the cup holder next to me. At last, I was able to open a decision on equal terms, the institute and myself, with nothing to lose. Your waitlist decision gives you exactly that: the opportunity to be on equal terms with MIT with the full peaceful acknowledgement that you have nothing to lose. That’s not something you get when you get admitted RD, nor EA. This institution is not a destination, it is a beginning. Your beginning, given that you made it even here, is shimmering brightly. From @Inspirational Hey all, I want to spread some positivity tonight. Four years ago I was in your shoes: MIT was my dream school and I knew I was the perfect fit for it. Unfortunately, I got the news on Pi Day 2019. I cried my eyes out for a week, and was stuck with an unsupportive friend group at the time who was happy to see the overachiever finally not succeed. Looking back, I was not really ready for MIT. I ended up going to my last choice college (that one of my friends even trashed on) and was originally devastated. However I said I could reapply to MIT for transfer or grad school. After my first semester at my college, I had such an amazing time I could not have seen myself anywhere else. I soon forgot about my sorrows because of how much I loved my school! I promise you, if you are amazing enough to want to go to MIT, you will thrive anywhere you go as long as you take up opportunities and have an open mind. I am so glad to reflect on how I was able to grow as a person (and only keep healthy friendships) during college, regardless of where it was. I got reminded to go on this page because I found a video of my decision reaction in my memories, and remember looking on this blog for solace. It made me less sad seeing everyone share their feelings. Ultimately, I decided not to choose MIT for grad school (haha see what I did there) because it was not the right fit for me. I got accepted into every grad school I applied to so far and they are the top schools in the US, something I would have never imagined with all of my “not accepted” letters four years ago. Sending all of the best to you in the same position that I was in. I hope this can help provide some solace to you on this day. I know it can’t cure your sadness right now, but please remember it when you do amazing things wherever you go :) Lots of love and light and of course MIT will always have a special place in my heart <3 From @Allison! Two years ago today, I, too, became an MIT reject. I was disappointed and unsure of where my undergraduate journey would lead. The rejection was the best possible outcome. I am thriving at my state school (Purdue!!) and have found a community of bright, talented, like-minded friends and colleagues that have transformed my life. Had many of my Biology and Chemistry friends not been rejected from MIT like me, it’s unlikely that we would meet. Before attending Purdue, I was unsure I would ever meet a group of openly nerdy, lovely, like-minded peers at any point in my life. Passionate people are everywhere, not just at MIT. While it is normal to be disappointed, do NOT let that disappointment detour your first steps of leading into a new path for educational pursuits. You applied to MIT. 
You knew that dream was bold, and you knew there was a chance you would not get in. But with that attempt, you were vulnerable and had the opportunity to learn about yourself. Within that attempt, there was ambition and passion. Wherever you end up in the future, do not let that ambition and passion fade. Chin up- so many opportunities lie ahead! You have no idea what gifts college brings if you are not open to other options. Allison (Biology|Secondary Ed|Chemistry|Wildlife Sciences Student) Purdue 2025 :) I think the community we build here on the blogs, especially among those who don’t attend MIT (at least at first) but come back here to comfort others, is really special, and I want to thank wox, Inspirational, and Allison! for sharing their stories with us. I hope others not admitted to the Class of 2027 find their paths soon too, and feel free to come back and share those stories (in the comments or via email to me) anytime.

I started writing blogposts when I came to MIT. I wanted to be like a CJ historian but for the history of myself throughout the years, and vaguely speaking I’d say this has been a moderate success (y’know, being an MIT Blogger now etc. I literally get paid to contribute to my own history book in the form of blogposts). And when I first started out blogging, nearly everything I wrote was about coffee. Literally to an almost insane degree. Coffee was a part of my identity in,,, perhaps an almost unhealthy(?) way. Not really unhealthy, but I was drinking   of coffee while writing these blogposts. Which is perhaps, inadvisable. Back to the point: I’ve started drinking less coffee(?!?!) truly wild. Who would’ve thought, drinking 3-4 cups of straight-up black coffee a day was unsustainable. But what is almost weirder than drinking less coffee, is that I have been substituting this drink  I used to hate tea. But to be fair, I also used to hate drinking coffee. Have I talked about this before? (Scrolls through various blogposts I have written so far) No I haven’t! Yay! Insert digression here: When I was in my sophomore year of high school, I took this writing class called English 1A– tldr it was intro to writing and reading course. It was about as interesting as the tldr sounds. But throughout this six week class, we had to write three four page papers and one massive 15 page paper. Around this same time, I hated coffee. But, I started wanting to be someone who drank coffee. I thought it would make me cool, which, it didn’t inherently? But coffee did make me a more well-rounded person. Anyways. So what I did, was I sat down with a cup of coffee and the prompt of each essay and said “either I finish this cup of coffee or a rough draft of my essay”. The first three papers I wrote I couldn’t finish the cup, but by the fourth I was a coffee drinking expert. Plus, I had found a whole new community of people to become a part of. This was the long and short of the story, but for a full length short story on this I wrote read  this In any case, I   used to hate tea. I thought it tasted like weird water, which to be frank was also the reason I used to hate hot chocolate made with water. I later realized this was because  
I was making them wrong. ⁠ 01 i.e. my ratios were just <em>way</em> off-- I was doing like a 1% hot cocoa mix to 99% water ratio. Which unsurprisingly, makes it taste like water. Now, I drink tea nearly daily. Mint tea to be precise. It all started one night while I was working on a problemset with friends. It was about midnight, and I wanted something warm to drink, to which  
my friend ⁠ 02 Omar if you are reading this, hi! He's a huge tea drinker. It weirdly makes me feel more like an adult. Like I am someone who doesn’t need to be running on caffeine 24/7 to simply exist. Which, there is nothing wrong with existing that way, but frankly it was making me  . It is rather annoying to be both   from coffee and simultaneously tired (which MIT is prone to make you feel). There’s a character in  
Dimension 20 ⁠ 03 a Dungeons and Dragons show I and numerous other bloggers watch Esther Sinclair And let me tell you: that  . Thank you Brennan Lee Mulligan for putting this concept of a personality trait into my brain. Because now   want to be the type of person who drinks tea throughout the day and coffee at night, which I couldn’t have been before I started liking tea. But now, I can be the sort of person who can go out with a friend and drink tea or coffee or whatever. I don’t super know how to end this blogpost. I mostly started writing this because it’s become a part of who I am now. Not like, in some crucially fundamental way (compared to coffee which fundamentally changed me by introducing me to my town’s community), but it has changed me. And where else to talk about it then in the blogs– to keep some track record of who I am, who I am becoming, and who I might become. Who knows what else will change about me in the next year, or next ten years, or twenty. Excited to find out. For now, going to keep stealing tea from dining halls. Random ending note: This blogpost was written during a pre-CPW event hosted for prefrosh! (The event was called “Write about Tea (with tea (with Paige))” and thus the title of the blogpost.) I drank green tea while writing this and while hanging out with cool prefrosh. Go to these events and hang out! They are fun! I think this is fun. #changes #teatime

Let’s meet the CNC mill. This one is called HAAS. He’s proven useful in 2.008, a meche class known for its final project: to manufacture 50 yo-yos. Mills can cut in 3 directions, (X, Y, Z), which makes them useful for cutting shapes into metal. In this case, we’re talking about molds for the plastic pieces of our yo-yo. I’ll make a blog on the yo-yo making process in full some time down the road. This blog is about CAM — Computer-Aided Manufacturing, or making the mill run automatically. A year and many days ago, I shuffled into

I thought I was an outlier until we started planning our final project, and a senior teammate said, “Yeah, I’m gonna learn CAM.”  As it turns out, we would all have to learn CAM. Manufacturing a yo-yo is fairly complicated. We’re injection-molding each plastic piece individually, and our yo-yo has 5 plastic pieces, meaning

I’ve never had a CAM lesson that penetrated before, but seeing his screen on a recording allowed me to go back and see every mouse-click, which was actually so useful. By now it was 2 am. I was in a good mood from fight club, despite having been beaten up, and I wanted more than anything to go to sleep.  So I went between the tutorial and my Fusion design, adding toolpaths and running simulations. A 9 am deadline makes crazy things happen. By 4 am, the CAM was done.  CAM pathway showing an endmill toolpath (yellow) as it cuts the sides of the mold (blue) The next day I felt mostly deceased, but I came to 2.008 lab and stayed awake this time as Josh taught us how to use the CNC. Its blades are enclosed in a big cage, and the machine will only run when the doors are shut, protecting human hands from spinning blades. The anxiety around running a CNC machine stems from the CNC tools being expensive. Bad instructions can cause it to break a tool and wreck your piece.  But I was too sleep-deprived to feel much anxiety. The atmosphere was relaxed as all five of us gathered around the machine. One of my teammates volunteered to run the CNC first, under Josh’s instruction. He kept testing the limits of how fast the machine could go.  We needed to finish the other half of the mold at open lab time during the week. I had taken on less work the first week, so I volunteered. finished mold clamped in the machine I came in to lab. A group of students were gathered around the lathe.

That’s the standard practice: you sit by the machine as it runs, always ready to step in. I thought about how much CAM and CNC had intimidated me once. Now my biggest worry was the machine finishing the process cut before I had to go to lab. You just do it. Or you put yourself in classes that will make you do it. It will come due, and then it will be done. Here’s the finished mold. We’re injection-molding the plastic yo-yo body next.  #2.008 #makerspace #meche

I’m taking a choreography class this semester! I heard about it in my freshman year, but only just got around to taking it since it was hard to schedule around; it’s 1-3 every Tuesday/Thursday and spring-only. I’m glad I committed to taking it since it’s just as great as I expected, and I’m super excited to have the opportunity to create choreography in an academic setting. every studio session feels like a blissful respite from the academic pressure of MIT, even if the pressure is significantly reduced now that I’m a senior. the class has a mix of trained dancers, self-taught dancers, and people with no dance experience whatsoever. some people dance in
 
MTA musicals, ⁠ 01 mit music and theater arts the instructor is a choreographer, dance filmmaker, and performer from Brooklyn. since she has a kid at home, she literally flies up from New York on Tuesdays and Thursdays for class. I’m really glad she does—it’s great to have a teacher with such a huge range of experiences. in the first few classes, we started to experiment with moving our bodies in different ways. the instructor told us to move around the room at different speeds, and when she said stop, she would give us an instruction of a texture, or feeling of a movement, to create. for example: “melt like an ice cube,” “float like a leaf on the ocean,” and “act like a balloon that’s been pricked and is gushing air.” this sort of improvisational activity was new to me, but pretty fun once I stopped internally cringing about how stupid I look. I started to understand how my theater kid friends are so comfortable with stepping out of their comfort zone, because when you have to run around a studio acting like a paper airplane more than once, you start to shed your ego entirely. when we practiced moving across the room with different textures, the ways in which we interpreted the given quality (for example, airy/floaty) varied, but we all felt comfortable moving in the way we wanted. there are no stakes to the class, so messing up is commonplace and accepted. it took only two classes for me to feel like I 1. didn’t have anything to prove and 2. was just there to have a good time and learn. we built up to making our own choreography with accumulation studies, where we would each create a move corresponding with an activity we enjoy, and then piece them together and “stage” them, aka arrange them to make a performance. we also learned  , which stands for: as someone who has only choreographed by just freestyling to music, it was interesting to be introduced to an actual breakdown of choreographic concepts. none of these have ever been at the forefront of my mind when I create a piece, except maybe “is this too repetitive/boring??” keeping the BASTE concepts in mind, we moved to our first assignment, which was a solo project involving making choreography that’s confined to a box. our instructor gave us a sheet of paper with a cube on it, then told us to randomly select 26 points within or on it. next, we randomly assigned the numbers 1-26 to each of the points, wrote the numbers at the bottom of the paper, and wrote the letters beneath them. then, we assigned arbitrary body parts to the numbers and letters. finally, we could piece together the prompt: to spell out our names by moving from point to point inside the box, using the corresponding body part each time. my box. e.g. point 1 was the first letter in my name (A) and associated with “back” I was initially offput by this assignment. I didn’t know how to feel about, well, being confined to a literal box, or having to use different body parts to make contact with
 
13 ⁠ 02 number of letters in my name 
six feet in the air ⁠ 03 promptly modified this one... the inspiration for this assignment was this solo, featuring a smaller box and much more trained dancer. nothing in this piece seemed familiar to me as a dancer, which only intensified my hesitation about my own piece. after a week, we presented rough drafts of the first five letters of our dances. watching the other pieces, I was frustrated with my work and envious of my classmates who are trained in dance styles like ballet and jazz. they seemed to have a much broader range of tools available to them, and in comparison, I felt limited in my strength, balance, and flexibility. things changed once I started adding transition movements in the dance style I’m most comfortable with. actually hitting the points in the cube was annoying, but dancing around the space was pretty fun. it only got better once we were given the option to add music. we could choose our own song, ask our instructor to pick one, or dance in silence. I immediately thought of a song that could work—  by Glass Animals—which I’ve wanted to dance to since freshman year. miraculously, with only a few minor additions and revisions, it worked with the choreography. as we finished stringing together all the letters in our names, the instructor asked us to incorporate more elements: a dramatic tempo change somewhere in the middle of the piece, and a return to the center of the box at each “space” in our names. meaning, we’d start at the center, return after our first name, and return at the end. this added complexity that I was excited about, given that I actually liked my choreography now. three weeks after we were given the assignment, we performed for the class and filmed our pieces. we had the option to wear costumes of our own choosing, which ranged from all black clothes to a full on green fursuit (I wish I was joking.) after watching a piece, we wrote feedback for each classmate, which was all super positive and fun to read. comparing how I felt performing the final iteration of my choreography to how I felt performing the first draft, I was pretty shocked. the moves didn’t change at all, but I enjoyed them so much more. overall, the assignment was super fun, not stressful, and interesting to create. trusting the process was hard, but as a senior who’s danced throughout college, it was a fascinating experience to put together a piece from the bottom up for the first time. it’s also interesting to have done this in an actual class setting during the day. going from Nonconvex Optimization to “dance like you’re a rock falling off a cliff” always gives me whiplash. being able to take a class like this feels unreal. I’ve heard similar things from my friends who take acting classes, and I’m glad I got the chance to experience it before graduating. with the  Beatles class I’m so glad 21M.712 still exists and has a great instructor! I would highly recommend it for anyone who: I’m glad this was my first (and last) taste of Theater Arts classes at MIT. if I could redo my four years, I would definitely take more of these. I already feel like my entire perspective of dance has shifted and I’m more comfortable with stepping out of my comfort zone. if you need a

It’s my junior year, and I am busy working on graduation requirements. I don’t   my classes, but I’m getting through (y’know, relatively). Sometimes people ask me why I’m doing this to myself, but I just tell them that I need to put in this work now for when I apply to schools this upcoming fall. And this is true: most of the classes I am taking are just classes I want to be on my transcript when I apply to college. Even if it might lead to burning out. This is just what my junior year has to be like. This is high school. — Four years later at MIT, and here I am, in the same boat. This semester, I am taking six classes. To be frank, it’s kind of tiring. But when I look at the list above, I can’t imagine dropping a single one.   and   I just really want on my transcript when I apply to graduate school.  is a class with my research advisor, and I’ve never taken one with him before. Plus, he’s a great teacher.   is a CI-M (a communications intensive class for my major in major), and for Course 18 (mathematics) you need two of these classes to graduate. I really didn’t want to be putting these off until my senior year. Finally,   will complete my humanities concentration in philosophy, and   fulfills my arts requirement. Yet still, as I sit here and write this out– diligently professing my case for why I am taking these classes, I’m left sitting here thinking “Welp, this is my life.” And I realize, that four years ago I felt the same way. — High school is,,,, an interesting time. I’m sitting in classes, taking notes, doing homework. This is most of what I do these days. I’m putting my nose to the grindstone, and refusing to yell uncle. But there are these moments– these time fractions of a second– when things feel  . When I’m not stressing about college applications or homework or grades, and I just get to exist. Like last night: my mom was out of town and I needed to get to my math practice. So, after classes, I rode my bike to the local university. It was golden hour, and I could feel the sun against my face. Non-blinding. Just. There. And I went and learned about math. I felt like myself for a moment, and I still don’t really know who “I” even am yet.  — I still don’t know who I am, but I know that I’ve been having these “moments” more and more recently at MIT. Moments when I’m writing an email, or  teaching a class . I start to see some semblance of adulthood starting to form before my eyes, and in these moments I forget about my six classes. I feel the sun against my face. Non-blinding. Just. There. It’s been a month since I’ve written my last blog. I’d open my laptop up, and just stare. No thoughts, head empty. I kept running out of energy–emotional and physical. But by not being able to write, I couldn’t refill this energy. I just felt low. But here I am, trying to write something, because it makes me feel like myself. My junior year in high school wasn’t so dissimilar to my junior year now. They are eerily very very similar in fact. I’m taking my classes, and completing my graduation requirements, and   my best to start being the person I want to become. But, after nearly a month of not writing a blog, I’ve remembered something I learned in high school: I cannot start being the person I want to be if I can’t make time for anything but my classes. I need to make brownies with friends, play video games, and write. These activities look very different in high school than they do now, but the moral of the story is the same: I need to start figuring out who I am. It’s weird. Taking many classes makes me realize that  . I mean, it’s something I need to do. But who I am is more than that. How do I keep forgetting this?

A/N: This post is coming out weeks after I intended for it to; please forgive me! If it makes it any better, this is a very long and fairly thorough post and also writing it required grappling with my existential dread about the passing of time and a lurking fear that I am wasting my life. So, there. I’m a big fan of Saturdays. I often have a PSET due Friday nights, so Saturdays are my ‘off’ days; I get up around 9, waste a lot of time eating brunch in Next dining, and proceed to mess around in some 3E lounge or other for the rest of the day. Sometimes, I go to the gym in the morning, and affectionately listen to Alison bemoan bicep curls and incline sit ups. A few weekends ago, at 1PM on a Saturday (most holy of days), Leo and Athena were sitting in ML. I don’t remember all that much except a certain feeling of lightness; my next assignment wasn’t due for 2 whole days (!!), so I was in no particular rush to finish anything. The sunlight felt almost generous as it streamed through the large, Charles-facing windows of the lounge. I sidled up to Athena, hoping to engage in some dumbassery TM , but I soon realized with chagrin that Athena had a spreadsheet open, and was doing something  horrifying  with Leo.  ‘We’re adding up our hours.’ Needless to say, I walked away with some haste. Leo enjoys being helpful, and sometimes he assists people by having them do an exercise. The instructions are simple: split up all 168 hours of the week based on how you plan to spend them. Athena and Leo have been doing this since our freshman year. It’s a smart idea; the goal is to, very objectively, determine whether or not you’re overcommitted. It’s a responsible idea.  It also makes my skin crawl.  There are a few reasons for this. For one, at this point in the semester, I had a growing suspicion that I was chronically overcommitted and needed to do something about it, but I had no particular intention to. I’d picked up a series of extracurriculars in the last semester, and I was slightly annoyed at myself for continuously accepting increasing quantities of responsibility with blatant disregard for myself and my time. I  wanted  to do all of it, though, so I kept going, continuously pushing down my uneasiness that the barely-afloat ship was going to go down in flames in a depressing way, rather than a spectacular one. Secondly, I strongly dislike the oh-so-prevalent commodification of time at the institute. As a student, time is wealth, time is precious, time is scarce. There’s a constant ticking in the back of my head, a timer until the next deadline. You can never truly  let go  during the semester . Portioning out exactly 2 hours a day for calorie consumption feels like a willing acceptance of time as an ever-present, prohibitive girdle on my existence.  Despite everything, though, I realized after some reflection that I was, in fact, fairly curious as to how I actually spend my time, and how that measures up to my expectations. Even though I was worried about being overcommitted, things  seemed  to be going fairly smoothly, so I wanted to know exactly what was going on. And so, I tracked everything I did for an entire week, blocked into 15 minute intervals. The intention was for it to be an accurate reflection of how I actually spend my time, but I suspect that I was probably more productive this week than normal, because I knew everything I did would be recorded. There’s a spreadsheet linked below with the breakdown! First, though, it would probably be helpful if I did a quick rundown of everything I’m doing this semester. Like most people, I am taking classes! I’m in 5 this semester; 6.046, 6.033, 18.413, 7.05, and 21M.301. I have things to say about all of them! 6.046: Design and Analysis of Algorithms – I like this class a  lot.  6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms) was a bit of a nightmare for me, so I anticipated dreading this experience; shockingly, though, I think I have realized that 6.006 sucked because life generally sucked freshman spring, not because I actually dislike theoretical computer science. The lectures are very engaging, and the process of solving the PSETs is really enjoyable; I appreciate the elegance of algorithmic solutions a lot. 046 making the endorphins go whoosh.  6.033: Computer Systems Engineering – I  strongly  dislike this class. It’s just… I spend much more time either baffled or aggressively annoyed in this class than I would like to. When Mihir warned me that the Design Project expectations were unclear, the papers were difficult to wade through, and the 25% participation grade was atrocious, I rolled my eyes, thinking it was a him thing. It was not a him thing. 033 is a CS major requirement, and I am convinced that if I actually were more sincere about it I would care more about computer systems, but oh my GOD this class is annoying. 7.05: General Biochemistry – This is the first biology class I’m taking at MIT! I promised myself I would take it as a treat, and I’ve been having a lot of fun. The first few weeks were a bit slow, but Yaffe is a very adept lecturer, and I think the class will get a lot harder. I will, however, complain about the 1.5 hour lectures at 9:30 every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the paper PSETs that must be turned in on Monday mornings. Not cool.  18.413: Basic Bioinformatic Algorithms – Another algorithms class! This has been… interesting. It’s a new class, so it’s kind of disorganized, but I’ve generally found the textbook and PSET content fairly interesting, plus it’s super relevant to my research interests. I really like algorithms… never thought I’d live to hear the day.  21M.301: Harmony and Counterpoint I – absolutely baller HASS. This class is a surprising amount of work; we have composition assignments that have been taking me upwards of 5 hours a week (L+Ratio), as well as music theory exercises. Nonetheless, lectures are  good,  and I feel more musical than I have in a while. I’m back at the piano, and my atrophying pinkies have recovered after a few good weeks of practice. I plan on concentrating in music, and this class has done nothing to dissuade me from it. I occasionally do other things! Here’s a list of my other commitments: Next Exec: I’m Vice President of Relations this semester; this is my first time being on Next Exec, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I ran for this position. Perhaps the biggest change is the  deluge  of email I now deal with. I have a problem with notifications; I physically cannot have unread/unresponded to messages in my texts or email inbox, so the amount of time that I now have to spend making sure things aren’t exploding when I open my gmail is a little embarrassing. We also occasionally meet with the House Team and Heads of House, and we have weekly Next Exec Meetings. UROP: I have a UROP in the Computational Biology Lab at CSAIL this semester. I’ve been working with a Cornell student who’s in the area for the semester, and I’ve been having a lot of fun! We do the codey-code and actually (?!) enjoy the codey-code.  Blogging: This is a job! That I have! And I don’t write enough for! Feel free to shame me. I swear I’m trying to do better – I have so many half-written blogs but they’re all  cringe  and  angsty  and I’m annoyed. I will drop more posts more often I SWEAR. Medlinking: idk man people just ask me for bandaids Next Sing: My dorm’s casual acapella group! I’m leading 2 acts (songs) this semester and singing in 3, but rehearsals hadn’t yet started during this week, so you won’t see much for it on the spreadsheet other than arrangement polishing. RPM: I’m a Resident Peer Mentor, which means that I generally attempt to be helpful to the freshmen in my wing. I’m supposed to be a go-to for academic, emotional, and social issues and also emergency situations. If this sounds stressful, it kind of is! RPM-ing is really meaningful to me; I hope that I have in some capacity made my freshmen’s experience easier. It’s also kind of hard to balance with the rest of my life, and can sometimes render me very emotionally burnt out. Some time must also be spent on generally attempting not to die – 2000 calories and 8 hours of sleep? ezmoney (this is a lie this has never been ezmoney). Also I occasionally exercise, or something? Socializing: I must socialize for extended periods of time (without simultaneously working) at least 2-3 times a week if I want to maintain my sanity. If you notice huge chunks of time labelled ‘fuck around’ time, it just means that on Tuesday night I was so fed up with work that I went down to 2W and did nothing useful until 3 in the morning.  Therapy: golden hour babieeeee. I love therapy; it’s the one hour in my week I leave free for emotional processing. I’m not sure if I should be like, you know, processing things for at least a few of the 167 hours in between, but emotional compartmentalization is my best friend, until my therapist points out the very obvious reasons I have been feeling like shit and then I feel mildly stupid. :thumbsup: Now that I have spent far too long explaining everything that I am doing this semester,  here is the spreadsheet  describing exactly how I spent every day for one week. Here are a few takeaways: I do more work than I thought I did. To be quite frank, I was under the impression that I was a bit of a potato who shirked all of her responsibilities. I mean that (mostly) in jest, but I did have the impression that I was a little bit less studious than I actually am. Including lecture time, I did somewhere between 55-60 of work for the week (depending on what counts), which I think is about as much as I can reasonably expect of myself.  I like, have to lay in bed for some amount of time after classes or I cannot survive. I didn’t realize that this needed to happen for 30-45 minutes every day.  I should stop skipping lectures. I missed two this week despite normally good attendance and I was  so  disoriented afterwards. Playing catch-up is never very fun. Learning the worm is the best way to spend 1.5 hours ever. I’m probably not overcommitted! Things seem fairly okay, and I feel fine. I also feel a lot more secure in getting my stuff done now that I know I have enough time to do it. And lastly, that my life is insane. I think, in the process of nicely formatting this spreadsheet, I realized how absolutely surreal my existence is.  Baseball  by Hippo Campus is one of my favorite songs; I play it often during my walk to class. There’s something very apt about walking across Briggs Field under a bright blue sky as the lyrics “There’s something fiction about the way that reality is going.” blast in your ears.   I go to  MIT  and I get to do things I love and find meaning in all day long.  Most people here, I think, live with the ever-present fear that there’s simply not enough time. Getting an education feels like a desperate attempt to outrun the decay of your brain, constantly fleeing the moment at which you lose the ability to see the connections, find the patterns, solve the problems. There’s so little time, so much to know and learn.  Time used to be so leaden, with the brutal impassivity of cold marble. It’s so easy to spend everyday working when that’s how you parse things. Do something great, or else your existence will have been futile. Time is the  only  thing worth anything, in that paradigm.  My understanding of life has changed; time has unfurled in the wind. I’m trying to spend my time doing the things I love with the people I care about.

in which i document some of my thoughts regarding my job search and how i decided what to do after graduation. this is a condensed version of a more comprehensive post that i wrote for myself but didn’t think was appropriate to put on the mit admissions blog; feel free to contact me privately if you want to read the longer version though!  options at the end of my job search i had offers from the following three places, and i was too tired to look for more options a large quant hedge fund, let’s call them  D . i had an offer for a quant research (QR) position, which i wasn’t super excited about because i don’t think working in finance is particularly good for the world (i don’t think it’s bad either; i think it’s very neutral) and i also don’t think QR work is that interesting (i previously did a QR internship and it was mostly just applying linear regression in various forms). however, it did mean i’d be living in new york, which i was interested in because most of my friends will be there next year, and obviously it was extremely high-paying. so even though my initial impression was negative, i thought if i committed to doing QR as my full-time job i’d likely end up discovering parts of the role that i enjoyed a small trading startup, let’s call them  A . while i’m not very interested in finance itself, i do think it’s impressive that trading companies have extremely performant and robust software. the problem is that, at larger firms, these systems have basically already been developed and are only being improved incrementally, so it seemed like if i joined a smaller company still in its early stages there would be a lot of interesting systems to build. in general i also just prefer working in smaller teams, so somewhere like  A  would be significantly more enjoyable for me than traditional finance places. other relevant considerations were that they’re in-person in chicago, and pay similarly to  D an ai research startup, let’s call them  G . one of my big regrets in college was not attempting ai research seriously, and  G  seemed like a good way to try that out. the part of their work which i’m excited about is developing ai tools that can help humans with more creative tasks (more broadly than the current paradigm of generating images and autocompleting text). another thing that stood out to me was that they have probably the highest-eq team i’ve ever encountered – throughout the process i felt like they were trying very hard to understand who i was as a person, the ceo read my mind several times and gave me good career-agnostic advice, etc. however, the main downsides were a) they’re in-person in sf and almost all my friends are staying on the east coast b) it wasn’t clear to me if they would be successful or not, since their research direction is somewhat unorthodox and some of my ai research friends did not think it was promising c) i felt a lot of insecurity related to committing to ai and maybe not being competent enough to make meaningful progress in the field initially i wasn’t that enthusiastic about any of these options because they all presented different tradeoffs and i didn’t want to accept any tradeoff whatsoever. after all, i’ve basically been in school for my entire life and haven’t seen that much of the world yet. how am i supposed to know how much i  actually  care about factors like changing the world or having money or doing good research, and how am i supposed to understand the value of each of those factors well enough to choose between them? sure, i  think  i know what i care about, but only from the perspective of a student who commits to projects for a semester or a summer at a time. so how do i choose something that will last for multiple years, possibly indefinitely? i’m reminded of this line from the commencement  speech this is water : “The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what ‘day in day out’ really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I’m talking about.” it was  so tempting  to just say no to everyone and try working on projects on my own for a year, and maybe support myself through tutoring and couchsurfing or something. if i was a little more impulsive and reckless maybe i would’ve actually gone through with that. somewhere in my head i knew that wasn’t actually the right choice though – i’m the kind of person who’s attracted to uncertainty because it allows me to project whatever i want into the void, but realistically i think if i went off for a year starting now i’d end up being less productive and more confused than if i stayed somewhere with reasonable mentorship  choosing i was very lucky and had offers from  D ,  A , and  G  at the same time, so i spent some time trying to compare them to each other. for a while i tried to get the best of all worlds – i was looking for a way to do interesting research and engineering work while staying on or near the east coast and making as much money as possible. this would probably involve either convincing an employer to let me work remotely, or switching jobs after one or two years i also tried to answer the question from a different angle –  what problems do i care enough about to spend a large portion of my life tackling?  i brainstormed a bit and came up with three general areas – ai, climate, and education (i am being deliberately vague here because the details would take another post to explain. also, this list will probably change in the future – for instance, i could definitely see brain tech or certain kinds of drug discovery being included). from that perspective it seemed like the obvious choice was  G but there’s a fundamental issue with this kind of reasoning – it assumes that you should pick a job based on what kind of problems you want to solve. you could just as easily argue that you should pick a job based on where you want to live or based on which job maximizes wealth (and people follow both of these guidelines all the time), in which case  D  or  A  would be the right answer. brainstorming which problems i cared enough about to dedicate my life to was a helpful exercise that clarified my intellectual interests, but that on its own couldn’t be the basis for deciding we could spend all day arguing about a specific choice, or we could go up one level and argue about decision-making criteria and metrics, or we could go up another level and argue about the process of picking a decision-making process, or so on. i think all supposedly rational decision-making processes fall to this problem of infinite descent, of being turtles all the way down in the end, none of the analysis i did in the previous section was particularly helpful. instead, it was a series of emotional heuristics pointing in the same direction that finalized my decision 2.1.  prisoner’s dilemma one extremely, extremely reductive way to model people’s career choices is as a  prisoner’s dilemma : a multiplayer game where each player can choose to  cooperate  (contribute to social good by working on impactful problems, while gaining less personal utility) or  defect  (maximize personal utility while working on something that doesn’t necessarily provide much value to other people).  this isn’t actually a good representation of the world because choices are rarely binary and impact and utility are complicated, but just bear with me for a few minutes for the sake of analogy anyway, in the classical version of the prisoner’s dilemma, people defect because it’s the rational thing to do but one of the main reasons everyone always defects in the classical prisoner’s dilemma is because they’re all making choices independently. the career decision problem is different, because all of our choices are correlated and entangled in ways that are difficult to quantify – one person exploring a new field can cause their whole social circle to begin exploring it, people who start companies often hire many of their friends, and so on. or, to explain this more generally: i thought about all the people older than me who have inspired me and shaped my life over the years, and then i thought about all the people younger than me who look up to me for advice. just as i use the stories of people who have come before me as benchmarks and references for what i should do, i know that people who come after me will use my story as guidance for what they can do and while there are many parts of this decision that i’m very confused about, here is one fact i am absolutely certain of:  i want to live in a world where young people choose to work on interesting, impactful, and difficult problems it sounds silly and irrational when i say it out loud, but i believe that we are unstoppable, that if we put all our heads together and try really hard we can solve almost every problem currently plaguing this world. and when i think about the fact that me cooperating will likely play a small role in many other people deciding to cooperate, it begins to feel like the obvious right choice this is the direction i want to push the world in, and once i thought about it in those terms i simply couldn’t bring myself to defect anymore 2.2.  freedom the thing i like the most about growing up is that you become more and more free over time. this process comes in many forms: you gain freedom from people like your parents telling you what to do, you gain freedom in social interactions as you learn how to have better conversations and be a better friend, you gain freedom in what you can create as you learn skills like programming or drawing or electrical engineering, and so on that’s a big part of why this quote from one of my favorite blog  posts  resonates with me so strongly: “Don’t surround yourself with ‘smarter’ people. The trick is to surround yourself with people who are free in ways you’re not.” i’m extremely familiar with the kind of person who goes to work in trading, because i did math contests with many of them for most of my childhood. a lot of them are smarter than me, or better at problem-solving, or can process information faster than me. but are they  free in ways that i am not? i know that i can learn engineering and modeling and statistics wherever i go. but where will i learn how to be a better research collaborator, or how to inspire other people, or how to have a less anxious relationship with work? it’s too early to be sure, but i really like what i’ve seen from the people at  G  so far and i think it’s the right choice for all the nontechnical directions i want to improve in 2.3.  ghosts there are two ghosts i’ve been haunted by lately. haunted in the sense that they keep coming back to me, without me trying to remember them, at least once every few days. here’s the first one: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”  –  Annie Dillard so many times in the past year i’ve been frustrated with what i was been doing, with feeling like i was taking too long to do homework or write code or take calls that felt meaningless and not having time to do things i wanted to as a result, and sometimes i would tell myself  after all this is over i’ll have time for things that matter.  and then it would dawn on me that how we spend our days is how we spend our lives, that this feeling of spending all my time on unimportant things will never end unless i end it myself, that i could easily keep this up for weeks and months and years and i would never make much progress on anything in particular and here’s the second one: “The part of life we really live is small. All the rest is not life, but merely time.”  –  Seneca i don’t want the hours i spend working to be merely time passed and money accumulated and tasks completed life is too short to spend so much time not really living, and when i think about what kind of work makes me feel alive, one common theme is that of  creation , of making something meaningfully different from anything that has come before it, of unlocking something new in the world. that’s one of the reasons i enjoy writing and arranging song mashups and teaching web development. it’s also one of the common themes in the three areas i mentioned earlier of ai, climate, and education – each one, if handled correctly, will give us a lot of capabilities we didn’t have before. that’s a big part of why these subjects feel fun for me to explore, even if objectively speaking i’m unqualified to do so 2.4.  conclusion to be honest, i still have some doubts about committing to working on ai research. part of it is because i have a hard time committing to things in general, and part of it is because i think the problems in the space are much more complex than anything i’ve worked on before. but i’ve realized that even if i don’t come up with anything, even if i spend all my time flailing around and making no progress whatsoever, even if everything work-related goes wrong, i  still  won’t regret this decision because i believe these problems are worth spending a few years trying. at the very least i’ll get a better sense of what it’s like to work in the space, as well as what my own limitations are, and if nothing goes well then afterwards i can find a different field to work in i’m also still pretty sad about leaving my east coast friends and moving to sf. i’ll try to keep in touch and visit often, but i’m not really sure what else there is to be done at the same time, there’s a lot to look forward to. for instance, some of my current interests are pipe dreams i’ve had ever since i was a kid – can we build systems that turn memories into music? can we make interpersonal communication less ambiguous by augmenting it with context and subtext? and so on – and i think we’ll get closer to answering these questions by exploring ai for that reason and all the other ones i’ve written generally intelligent

in the heart of the Frank Gehry-designed Stata Center, the icon of architecture of MIT’s campus, lies a pub. it opened in 2004 and was used for at least a decade, but has since been abandoned for wayfaring students to stumble across. in my time, I’ve heard it being used for parties, scavenger hunts, and the like, which is why I was fascinated to hear that one of my good friends, Karyn Nakamura ’23, was repurposing it for an immersive installation. a complex installation that would take several months to build, no less. the project, which Karyn refers to as a “20-channel Frankenstein video organism,” is composed of E-waste scavenged from campus
 
storage closets ⁠ 01 such as the Theater Arts tech closet, which has a ton of obsolete equipment that is gathering dust 
dumpsters. ⁠ 02 specifically, the Stata loading docks, an e-waste and recycling pick up spot where you can find a variety of abandoned technological items Karyn’s performance, titled  Break My Body, Liberate My Soul , is about an hour long and consists of multiple scenes of varying lengths. it begins with Karyn moving through the room, connecting wires, filling glasses of water, and pressing buttons that gradually seem to rouse the system. once it fully comes alive, all the screens turn red and it launches into a gripping and ominous glitch sequence that displays the words “coursing through your body and soul.” the scene, which is coupled with a jagged electronic sound, perfectly sets the tone for the frenetic visuals that are to come. as the scenes unfold, you struggle to discern what is happening in front of you, but feel yourself being immersed in the space more and more. one sequence features footage of people eating, working, and talking within the Stata Center, which is an interesting interaction with the very building harboring the organism. in another scene, water starts dripping from above into a wine glass on the ground holding two ends of cable, thus completing the circuit; later, Karyn fully submerges herself in a glass tank. there are countless elements to the installation that I couldn’t detect even after two watches. with everything going on—the music, the sound of dripping water, the humming of the machine, and the intense flashing from screen to screen—it becomes difficult to process what you’re experiencing. when the show ends, you’re left with feelings of awe, wonder, and overwhelming confusion. Karyn planned the installation over the summer, before she even knew she’d be able to use the R&D pub. for the first time in her artistic history, she spent a lot of time developing the concept, then found songs she wanted to use and decided what footage would pair with the sound. she didn’t have a complete idea of how the organism would manifest, but knew she wanted to work with electronic signal and to understand technology through emotion and intuition. she had been thinking about noise and signal and the subjectivity of defining the two, and she felt strongly about the ability of video to communicate beyond language, which she had picked up from obsessively scouring the internet for all kinds of video art.  after formulating a concrete idea of what she wanted, Karyn switched to execution mode, which marked the beginning of a lot of fighting. she knew she wanted a permanent space to work in, as opposed to the classrooms she had previously used where she would have to clean up her equipment before class. the Stata R&D pub, on the other hand, was an unused—and very fucking cool—space for her to leave dozens of monitors and cables lying around. Karyn found the pub a year ago, and when she was thinking about potential spaces she could use for her project this fall, it immediately came to mind. the next step was figuring out how to get permission. this entailed endless email chains with multiple branches of staff and admin to explain the unconventional project. Karyn first reached out to the director of CSAIL and MIT Dining, who welcomed the project since they knew about her previous large-scale work . the project ultimately went through an extensive safety process that involved it becoming an official Campus Construction Project stamped by external engineers. it was a lot, but Karyn is thankful for the team of staff and admin who worked with her to preserve her vision and ensure safety. part of the approval process was envisioning the details of the space and the physical structures that would hold everything together. although Karyn was unfamiliar with what a feasible structure entailed, her instructor from the Theater Department, Josh Higgason, consistently reassured her that everything she wanted to do was possible. he was the one to make her model a reality, putting the scaffolding together and making the glass tanks hang from the ceiling.  the development process was uncertain; Karyn had no idea how to put together scaffolding or how to suspend 80 pound tanks, whether she would have enough CRTs and monitors, and if it would even be possible to distribute signal to the 20 screens with limited hardware and budget. thankfully, she ended up receiving a $5K grant from
 
CAMIT ⁠ 03 ”Council Karyn describes the entire process as “a semester of wrangling and fighting” with technology, rules, and herself. making the video content, the structure, and the signal distribution system all involved pushing the limit of what was possible and advisable. the result is nonsensical and magnificent, inspiring discomfort, reflection, and introspection. many people struggle to find their response to the performance, and many wouldn’t find it to be palatable or even approachable, but I find it to be a fascinating reflection of herself through the body of a complex machine. she finds a compelling balance between intention and randomness, which is an incredible feat.  my favorite part of the performance epitomized this. this scene, the final one in the show, is a frenzied, glitchy sequence of footage and animation synchronized with the song  Moanin’  by Charles Mingus. I thought it was a perfect way to conclude; the music builds up into an epic climax as one of the bottom monitors displays “I’M LEAKING” and chaotic images ricochet between the other screens. Karyn told me she spent a full month on this scene, at times spending a full day on just one second. it definitely shows. Karyn’s ability to compose and sequence glitch is masterful. the project is truly the culmination of her experience trying to be creative at MIT—spending a summer working with light and projection in
 
W97 ⁠ 04 the theater arts building I think the installation is phenomenal, but Karyn asserts that she’s only 70% satisfied, attributing this to the fact that she has moved onto different ideas, as well as the fact that her personal experience of what was packed in the hour-long show was a five month long struggle. such is the inevitable nature of artistic creation, I guess. Break My Body, Liberate My Soul  is a fascinating installation on multiple dimensions. there’s the irony of bringing scavenged analog tech into Stata, which is home to the most cutting-edge AI research on campus. there’s also the fact that that Karyn’s academic experience as a Course 4-B (Art and Design) has been nothing but an uphill battle; she has found it difficult to fully engage with classes in the architecture department due to their focus on utility and problem-solving. parameters are rigid, and you’re graded based on how well you can adhere to them. Karyn stated that many of her instructors have a strict curriculum that they want to impress upon students; moreover, they aren’t interested in learning about her as a person, so she’s had a hard time introducing herself and her ideas. in light of the fundamental and unbridgeable gap between the art she wants to do and the art Course 4 tries to make her do, her R&D installation is a triumph. while Karyn has expressed discontent with architecture classes, she has enjoyed Art, Culture, and Technology (ACT) classes, as well her interactions with the Theater Department. she said these classes and the community she has found in the small bubbles of art at the school have really helped her “continue in the demoralizing fight that is trying to be creative at MIT.” fighting to do what she wants in Architecture classes is tiring, so it’s reassuring to have the liberty to create on her own terms. Karyn is a remarkable individual and it makes sense that design instructors don’t know how to deal with someone so unique. most students take design classes
 
casually ⁠ 05 as their one humanities arts requirement it’s unfortunate that Karyn has experienced a wall between herself and most Course 4 instructors she’s had. she expressed that she feels like she can only be creative to a certain extent, and doing art involves a lot of fighting. however, this fighting opens doors to building relationships and trust with the few people who will give you a chance. while Karyn has run into walls and felt discouraged at times, she is extremely grateful for the support she has found here. without her instructor Josh, she wouldn’t have been able to obtain all her video gear, or make her pub design a reality, or suspend TVs 20 feet in the air. MIT Dining, Campus Planning, Campus Construction, and Facilities helped her use the space and ensure the safety of the project, and the Theater Arts Department gave her the resources to make it possible. she also thanks all her friends and instructors who believed in her throughout the painstaking semester-long process. Break My Body, Liberate My Soul  is testament to the fact that there are still ways for students to find holes in structures that only seem to become more rigid, exercise the autonomy that they deserve, and to express themselves in the ways that they want. in the past few decades, a lot of restrictions have been levied against the student body, so it’s reassuring to see students finding the means to make their ideas possible, especially when they’re as large-scale as this. I’m happy to have had two opportunities to witness the ‘Frankenstein video organism’ come alive, and I wish more students could get a chance to see it. sadly, Karyn is taking down the installation in April, but you can still check out her other  work here!

march is a rough month. you are lost, not only in a pile of things to see and things to do, but probably also in a pile of emotions you can’t really identify. so here is a guide, for those lost. this emotion is AAAAAAAAAAAAA. it’s the constant screeching noise in the back of your head you can’t really seem to get rid of. it gets in the way of your coherent thoughts and makes you lose focus. but sometimes, you just need to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. if you AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, you’ll usually hear less AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA in your head. this is fear. a close cousin to anxiety, but not quite the same. it’s experienced in shorter, more intense bursts, and is often in reaction to something tangible, like a flying cockroach, or disapproval from others. fear was developed for survival and may trigger strong reactions, though it’s results vary from person to person. your body will respond to fear. this is known as a fight or flight reaction: your heart rate increases, your breathing increases, and digestion and other normal processes slow. this is anxiety, often a derivative of fear. you may or may not know what is about to happen, whether you experience a presumed impending doom, or an unknown. you may not be able to deal with it right now, or you may not be able to control an outcome. and that’s okay. time will flow, a curse it may be, but it will bring you somewhere. you might have to tools to ease your situation, but maybe you’re overwhelmed with everything else happening in your world. it may be unfounded, it may be unreasonable to an outsider, and it may be long term, but it still takes its toll. your body will respond to anxiety. refer to fear. this emotion is confusion. you don’t know what is happening. your brain makes noises, and you might make noises too. this is processing, more an interim between emotions than an actual emotion. it’s a purgatory in which you are stuck unsure how to react or feel about something. other emotions you feel are either obscured or blurred together, and time may warp to fit your processing. it can be thought of as many thoughts fighting each other for headspace, or not enough to fill the void. like a computer on a loading screen, you’re stuck processing too much information all at once. a manual reboot (nap time) in my experience sometimes helps. lastly, this is grief. a mixture of base emotions like sadness, anger, and helplessness merged into one, in response to loss. the loss can be loss of a friend, an object, an opportunity, time, or other things. grief is one of the most difficult emotions to hold in and let out. one might say it has high inertia. but once it flows out, like an boulder tumbling down a mountain, it’s difficult to stop as well. your body will respond to grief. your chest tightens, your throat may feel weird, you facial muscles can tense up, and sometimes your eyes involuntarily pee. but holding in your pee is never pleasant. if your eyes need to pee, it’s okay to use the bathroom too. emotions are normal and human. and you (probably) are too. processing emotions can be annoying at best and a grueling fight at worst. do take care of yourselves, and if you have the bandwidth, others around you who might need it as well. <3 ##anika attempts informative writing

MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2027 are now available in the  application portal . To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update.  This past year, inclusive of both Early and Regular Action, 26,914 students applied to join the MIT Class of 2027. This is fewer than the  33,796 who applied last year , before we  reinstated our testing requirement , but more than the  20,075 who applied for entry to the MIT Class of 2024 , which was the last class selected before we  suspended our requirement  for the first two years of the pandemic. Ever since our application opened last August, our dedicated team has carefully considered them all, subject to our standard of  attentive, empathetic, holistic review .  Of those 26,914 applicants, we have
 
offered admission to 1,259 students ⁠ 01 This is the fewest students we have ever admitted, due primarily to our significantly increased yield in recent years, while our target class size has remained the same (1,100). climb the mountain that is MIT . They hail from all 50 states, 63 countries, and nearly 900 different high schools. Though they all do different things — linguistics and lacrosse, cartography and Catan, topology and tango — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with  MIT’s mission  to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to our campus to join the outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home. There are also students who may be climbing other mountains, with other fellow mountaineers, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a modest number on our  waitlist  and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2027. Getting to “meet” so many capable, compassionate students through this process has, as always, left us  bleary-eyed  and reminded us that what we do is  more than a job : it is a privilege and an honor. We are grateful to have walked this short part of  your path  with you.  If you are among the many stellar students to whom we are not offering admission, then I want to remind you  success is not always a straight line . Your future isn’t something MIT creates for you, it’s  something you manifest for yourself . And if you spend the next few years trying to make wherever you are as amazing as you can (as you already are), then
 someday you’ll look back on this Pi Day ⁠ 02 Last week I met up with a student we denied four years ago today; she was on campus for the visit program for admitted PhD students in Mechanical Engineering. I’m closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for  admitted waitlisted not admitted here , with more information about next steps to come in early April. Congratulations to the Class of 2027, and best wishes to all of our applicants. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.

A lot of students applied to MIT this year, and unfortunately, we just couldn’t accept them all. We have placed a small number of students on the waitlist. If you would like to be considered for the waitlist, or you want to learn more about it, you can  read more here Waiting has a reputation for being stagnant or tense or boring, but, if you take time to nourish yourself, it can also be full of unexpected growth. We  keep continuing Some of you may feel happy to be waitlisted. Some of you may feel sad. Some of you may have  complicated feelings give it time a little patience

There were many wonderful applicants to MIT this year, which unfortunately means that we had to turn down some great students. For those of you who fall into this category, this is an open forum for you to talk,  shake it off survive thrive wherever whatever Stove-cook your oatmeal do things that make you happy the small distractions of life We understand that this may be a difficult time for you, but we ask that you converse civilly and with the best of intentions, as that is the spirit of our process.

We–Jebby, Jenny, Kai, and Isbla–animated this year’s Pi Day video! If you haven’t checked it out yet,  lookie here. 
6.141 ⁠ 01 Robotics: Science and Systems Kai sums up these 2 months perfectly:  I actually didn’t know that I was going to be in charge of this year’s Pi Day video until Karen, one of our lovely admissions officers, said that they needed someone to do it this year because  Audrey was going to be in Wales The video goes kinda fast and is
 
abstract ⁠ 02 probably easier to animate hehe and also in the spirit of the original NGE anime opening Basically, Giant Aliens, called “angels” in the NGE universe, have come to steal MIT’s silver tubes due to their magical properties, i.e. the ~magical~ acceptance letters inside them. Stu and Tim gather MIT students to defeat the angels  using the  MIT cheetahs Left is a giant robot/an Evangelion from NGE, right is an MIT cheetah. There is some resemblance…? The dude with the brown hair is a prospective student who develops magical powers and shatters Ramiel, the blue, octahedral angel who is also the best girl in NGE /srs.  ramiel is best girl One of the students is last year’s Pi Day video’s protagonist, who uses their fire spinning prowess to defeat Matariel, the spider-lookin’ angel after Stu blinds it with some smoke spouted from a silver tube. Tim defeats Sachiel, the angel with a red orb, by releasing a magic rope from his silver tube and tripping Sachiel. Here are screenshots of my Google Slides presentation to Karen that demonstrate that my head is mostly full of limp scribbles. Previous Next  We used OpenToonz, which is the free, open-source version of the software that Studio Ghibli uses, to do most of our animation because Procreate’s animation software looked a bit sus. Basically, it’s a digital painting program with a  t h i r d  dimension: time, in the form of video frames. You can do fancier things like define keyframes and interpolate between them, as well as define the duration of frames and layers. The moment I saw “Studio Ghibli” on OpenToonz’s Github repo, I was hooked, but then I was /devastated/ to learn that OpenToonz is kinda stinky because it keeps crashing for no reason and doesn’t have the greatest effects library implementation :(  . But it’s definitely good for beginners! I’m just gonna do everything in Blender’s grease pencil from now on because I’m also interested in learning 3D stuff…   OpenToonz was actually mostly fine for me; it only crashed once! It probably kept crashing for Isbla because she did all the rendering in it; I was just using it to color. I did run into a few issues owing to its  stunningly  bad documentation, but I think for personal animation projects in the future I’ll likely use OpenToonz; it’s definitely capable enough for simple animations.  If you’ve seen last year’s Pi Day vid, you might recognize who the firespinner is! Previous Next I drew up the character designs for both the tech guy and the student who gets their silver tube in the end. I was definitely going for a cyberpunk vibe with the tech dude.  I designed the girl who operates the giant laser! She
 
UROPs ⁠ 03 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program 
RLE ⁠ 04 Research Laboratory of Electronics Previous Next I’m proud and terrified to say that I did all the animated line art for the video! I thought assigning this to one person would allow the drawings to be consistent, but honestly, I really should’ve done mostly the keyframes and split the in-betweening with someone else because I probably had to draw >600 frames. I am also VERY much a beginner at animation, so I think I’ll definitely be faster at this if I were to do it again. There’s many guidelines on how to animate, and I devoured many a video on “how to not make anime hair look like turd.” Here’s a couple principles for doing 2D animation that are especially important to the making of this video: There’s two main animating processes: pose to pose and straight ahead animation.  Pose to pose is when you define the key frames of your action sequence and animate the halfway points recursively like a binary search. This is good for  planned  Straight ahead animation is when you see where the animation takes  you , i.e. you draw the key frames sequentially without planning the start and end of the action. This is great for drawing highly entropic things like fire, where it’s not productive to plan out the start and end of the sequence. The concept of  is important in animation to emphasize actions that would otherwise look rigid. To generate anticipation for a certain action, you generally want to animate an action that is the “opposite” of the main action before the main action. For example, check out this clip of our prospective student shattering Ramiel. He doesn’t just raise his hand immediately, but hunches down in anticipation of the action. This brings more life to your animation, but for some reason looks really cartoonish if you do it irl? I think it’s because animations have to work harder to convince us that they are good imitations of real life, and therefore benefit from exaggerated actions. Previous Next Squash and stretch are also important guidelines that make animations seem more alive, and it’s what it sounds like. I generally don’t see it employed in anime, so I decided not to go too ham on this. However, Western animations use it a lot: Since Isbla and I were the two people in our group with drawing tablets, we decided to split up the animation work into lineart and coloring. I got to do the coloring which was very fun! It was also less intimidating than doing lineart for 600 frames by hand lmao. Once Isbla finished the lineart for a scene, she would send it to me and I’d open it in OpenToonz. On each frame, I used colored lines to denote regions of shadows, highlights, or different colors (I don’t have an example of this from the pi day video since I colored over all the scenes already, but here’s roughly what it looks like in OpenToonz at this point – screenshots taken from the  tutorial video  I watched to learn to color): Then you fill in each region with the corresponding color and clean things up, and yayy the frame is done :) I went sort of overboard with highlights/shadows in some scenes, but it was really fun to see things turn out smoothly. For instance, I really enjoyed how the prospective student head turn sequence turned out, as I wanted to make it look like they were turning towards the light and I think that effect was accomplished. Previous Next I’ve already seen most of MIT’s past Pi Day videos. They’re freaking awesome, and the people who worked on them are freaking awesome. So when I was asked if I wanted to work on this year’s Pi Day video, my answer was an obvious YES. When I learned that this year’s vid was based on  Evangelion , my answer was a DOUBLE YES (I am an   enjoyer). I chose to work on backgrounds for two reasons: Practical reason:  I use an iPad and the Procreate app for digital art. Like Isbla said, Procreate’s animation feature isn’t as fine-tuned as industry-grade animation software like OpenToonz, so it just makes the animation process a lot harder than it already is. On the other hand, OpenToonz isn’t available for the iPad, and I don’t have a drawing tablet that I can hook up to my computer. But although animating with Procreate has its share of unnecessary obstacles, it’s great for making still images. Personal reason: The process itself was pretty straight-forward—I started off with a sketch, then line art, added flat coloring, and then some shading and fancy rendering. AAAAAAAAA I remember back in 2018 (I took a gap year, I know I am O L D) I binge watched all the pi day videos up to the BB-8 one as a source of comfort as I waited for decisions so I definitely wanted to give back once I got here. In freshman year, two of the upperclassmen (Jamie ‘19 and Kristen ‘19) on my hall were leading  The BIG PI(E)  and my froshy self decided to get very well acquainted with canned peaches and butter as we prepped the massive pie all night. Now that I’m in my senior year, I’m super grateful I was given the opportunity to come full circle and help this year’s pi day video come to life! I was mainly tech art support for this project – animating sections in Blender that would otherwise be too tedious/painful to do in 2D. I’ve been self learning Blender since before COVID and it felt great to put my skills to the test and see my hard work pay off :’) Blender has built-in text and fonts support so I found some fonts similar to the original and it was already looking pretty nice. Each piece of text is a mesh plane, so it was super easy to start off with the PI DAY text angled so the top is closer to the camera for the strong perspective look and then unrotate + move away from the camera to match the movement from the original intro. I then added bloom by assigning an emissive material to the text and changed the colors of the text by interpolating between the light blue and the orange-red gradient keyframes. I was hoping that Blender would have some option that would allow me to easily add a white border around the text (PI DAY and the 3.14.23 date), but I ended up just outsetting the mesh and assigning a white material to the border. When Isabella mentioned she wanted Ramiel to break into a bunch of pieces (which would be super tedious to do by hand in 2D), I offered to try to do it in Blender! I knew that Blender had a free Cell Fracture add-on, so it was just a matter of tweaking the settings a bit to get a good distribution of sizes and breakage points. To get the pieces to explode a bit more naturally (and so I wouldn’t have to keyframe 70 pieces), I took advantage of Blender’s physics system and set each piece as a rigid body. Once they were rigid bodies, I could control their movement by adding Force Fields into the scene – Charge, Turbulence, Wind – and tweaking the values to get the end effect we wanted. To make sure the style didn’t look too different from the rest of the scene, I added line art around each of the pieces using Blender’s grease pencil line art option to keep the 2D look and composited it with Jebby’s beautiful backgrounds! The spinning hologram is mostly just me trying to understand how to holographic emissive materials in several different ways – I basically took a cylinder and cut it into these smaller subpanels and put fun hacker things on each of them. I found this amazing  hologram shader tutorial  by Derek Elliot and thought it was perfect for the course 6 character. Components from left to right: Concentric circles for triangulation, random scrolling hacker code, radar shader tutorial from Simon 3D, 3D model of Sachiel I found online with the hologram shader, simplified MIT map, trigonometry > Stata 3D model I actually used this 3D scan of the Stata Center for a class project last fall so I just did a bit of preprocessing work to make the model easier to work with and fit the style better. I baked all the textures and combined the mesh into one piece so it wouldn’t clutter up the scene and used the same Blender grease pencil modifier to add the line art automatically. I think Isabella did some post processing magic for it to add depth of field and more contrast as well! > Smoke I considered using Blender’s built-in particle simulation to do a real smoke sim, but since the rest of the video is much more anime, it would’ve looked a bit out of place. After doing some searching on Youtube, I found this  anime smoke and explosion  tutorial by Kristof Dedene (highly recommend this channel btw if you want to do any vfx/anime/stylized effect). I ended up using 4 small smokes + 1 torus to get the end effect. I had them trail after one another and then spread to fill the screen – manually keyframed -_- – but I think it turned out pretty nice! Kristof even covered how to make the smoke disappear (shader magic) which was perfect for the firespinner entrance! Overall, I had so much fun learning more about what Blender is capable of while working alongside such great artists! Tldr; After Effects is poggers, and you can (most of the time) make a bad animation into a good animation with VFX. At first, I played around with the lighting effects in OpenToonz for sooooo long trying to get that anime bloom™ effect, but as mentioned above, OpenToonz is slightly stinky; effects at the edges of fill boundaries don’t render well. So I had to begrudgingly use After Effects because it’s easier than learning Blender for effects when I had <12 hours to edit the whole video :P; begrudgingly because I would prefer using free, open source software. It turns out I really like After Effects because of its ease of use and endless lighting options. I’ll be very sad when I graduate and no longer have free access to Adobe products. To demonstrate the power of After Effects, here’s a scene before and After Effects. Also this  tutorial P.S. join the Motion Design Club for After Effects tutorials! Email me ( [email protected] ) to add yourself to  [email protected] I used the free version of DaVinci Resolve 16 to edit the video, which for an editing noob like me, was pretty intuitive. And especially since we already had a set soundtrack, it was basically dragging and dropping our animated clips. However, I didn’t know the best format to render in, so there ended up being some pretty obvious rendering artifacts. See if you can spot them! As a note to self, pls change the key frame setting from automatic to every 1 second. What do we do from here?  I think the best thing about this whole process is how much each of us learned– storyboarding, animating, making backgrounds, navigating esoteric software docs, to name just a few. Now we’re all better equipped to make even cooler things in the future :) I for one will definitely be animating some more in the future, so stay tuned!

Few things on God’s green earth fill my little southern heart with as much delight and euphoria as a southbound train. There ain’t nothing like slowing down to ride an American train and take in the natural splendor you can find all across the country. Previous Next I’ve ridden my fair share of intercity trains here in the USA, on the East Coast and the West Coast, along the Great Lakes and down the Mighty Mississippi. Among all the Amtrak trains I’ve experienced, three stand out to me in particular. The passenger train receives woefully little love in the US of A, but it’s historically played a massive role in the growth and development of this land. I’d like to look in particular at the cultural role of passenger trains in the American South, with the help of country music. The first forms of transportation to come to mind regarding country music, and rightfully so, are usually the pickup truck and eighteen-wheeler. Pickup trucks are a staple of bro-country hits from Florida-Georgia Line’s “Cruise” to Tim McGraw’s “Truck Yeah” while trucker country is a fully fledged subgenre within country with hits such as C.W. McCall’s “Convoy” and the band Alabama’s “Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler).” However, the train, especially the freight train, used to and, to some extent, continues to play an important role in country music. The freight train is a subject of particular fascination, showing up in classics like the Delmore brothers’ “Freight Train Boogie” and contemporary country, as in Alan Jackon’s acclaimed  Freight Train However, the story of passenger trains in country music is also the story of the decline of passenger rail travel. The classic “City of New Orleans” describing the route of the same name was released in 1971, when the route was on the brink of being decommissioned. 1971 was also the year Amtrak was founded to consolidate remaining passenger train services and, ideally, to save them. Country music is considered to have originated in a recognizable form in the early 20th century, and, thus, half of the genre’s history coincides with the decline of American passenger trains. The story of country music is both a story of the rise and fall of train travel, but the prominence of trains even in contemporary music reflects the role of nostalgia in country music. Even classic country songs involving trains were often written after their heyday; the train is a tool for artists to hearken back to an imagined “simpler place and time,” as Gladys Knight and the Pips sing in “Midnight Train to Georgia” (the first non-country song cited). Nowadays, trains aren’t what they used to be, but here are the rootinest, tootinest destinations that make me love the routes I mentioned at the beginning: Atlanta, Savannah, and New Orleans. Atlanta, with its booming growth, is a distinctly southern metropolis, whose shadow I grew up in. It’s a truly lively city with a lot of diversity and life; it’s also the center of the South’s burgeoning film industry: Y’allywood. Previous Next From the cobblestones on River Street to the several regularly-spaced parks reflecting its historic urban fabric, Savannah is, to me, the most charming town in America. Previous Next New Orleans might be the most unique city in America, with its historic streetcars still running and the architecture of the French Quarter seldom seen elsewhere in the country. Previous Next I’ve visited all of these cities via Amtrak and had a truly wonderful time. I often visit Georgia by taking Amtrak all the way between Boston and Atlanta, changing trains once along the trip to visit friends or see the sights, typically in New York or Baltimore. I took a trip along the East Coast between Boston and Savannah, stopping in several cities along the way. My favorite train trip of all time was a 2-week trip from Boston to Chicago to New Orleans to Birmingham to Atlanta to Washington DC and back to Boston. I’ll never forget being in Chicago and boarding the train to New Orleans, hearing southern accents for the first time in ages and feeling at home. And that is the power of the southbound train: getting a taste of home.

Until very recently, ⁠ 01 read, they still haven't kicked me out of the group chat yet. 
executive board ⁠ 02 or, exec. During my two years on Next Exec, I sent probably around 70 emails to our dorm’s official moderated mailing list, for everything from clarifying COVID policies to announcing large social events to publicizing important surveys on campus issues. It’s not always a fun job, although I would like to think I’ve gotten pretty good at it over time. Most importantly, however, to break the monotony of sending these emails, I changed my email sign-off for almost every email, meaning that I now have a compilation of all these important contributions to the art of email. Without further ado, every email sign-off I have included in an email to Next House, ranked in tiers from most to least socially acceptable. Feel free to reuse them at your own risk. These are my default email sign-offs, regardless of the context. I think you can’t go wrong with them; if you’re asking for something or have something to genuinely thank someone for, “thanks” is a good option. Otherwise, “best” is pretty good and generally unobjectionable. These are pretty normal phrases, and are generally within acceptable parameters for their given contexts. They’re not typical for “business email”, but people (probably) wouldn’t bat an eye at them. These are a little more out of the ordinary, but useful for the right circumstances; these were for some of the more serious emails I sent during my term, where things were particularly difficult—often as a result of changes in the COVID situation or during finals weeks. I’m a big fan of fun words, especially “yeehaw”, which was used aggressively by my predecessor and is now an integral part of my vocabulary. “Feelsbox” is a local word for an open-ended question placed at the end of forms to gather any feels the form submitter may have; this sign-off linked to a form that just contained a feelsbox. These are just some phrases, some of which have some context—”strongly agree”, for example, comes from an email about surveys—but most of which are just…kind of there. These are probably less normal than the ones in Tier 1. Probably. I’m feeling kinda blue myself, if you know what I mean. “yfn” means “your friendly neighborhood!”, and you can read more about mailing list culture at MIT  here 
alan These sign-offs just build upon some of the items from Tier 2. “Yeehaw” becomes “Yee and Haw”, and “your friendly neighborhood <role>” becomes “your friendly neighborhood alan.” It’s me! I’m your friendly neighborhood Alan. This word was invented when
 
someone ⁠ 03 that someone might have been me, I don't remember. Maybe we’ll finally run out of tomatoes this year, These are in-jokes which I would take too long for me to explain to you and also are not funny, so I will not explain further. Just imagine a mild sense of laughter in your chest, perform it, and move on. Pingu says hi! please make it so it doesn’t look like a customink box exploded in my room, thanks, obligatory pub for the asymptones concert tomorrow at 5 pm in 10-250, And, of course, the blatant advertisements! Sometimes you’ve just got to advertise for something unrelated in your
 
otherwise coherent ⁠ 04 dubious, discuss. Before we move to the most absurd tier of email sign-offs, I want to introduce one honorable mention. This is not an email sign-off, but I was sending a lot of emails late August of last year. This was a stressful time for a number of reasons, and I was responding to an email on my phone at the end of a busy day… i have never been so ashamed Not too absurd…but still pretty absurd. Yeehawing my way downtown These are the logical conclusions to all the “yfn” and “yeehaw” sign-offs which have come before. I have also included the original link on the last sign-off: every year, my dorm has a contest to see who can avoid hearing Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” for the longest amount of time after November, and so people often lay traps in links in their emails…like this one. From Beethoven’s 9th and Schubert’s  , both of which I’ve sung in various forms. I don’t actually know why I decided to include them in an email, but it’s too late to ask my past self now. If I’m here, and you’re here, who’s driving the bus? Some important questions for our times. These last two sign-offs express the contradictory parts of our selves, when sometimes we know we are out of ideas and yet we still continue to search for more. They are also both still true.

SnowDays It’s been around since 2002, so it might be older than some of you reading this. I first played with the website in 2009, when it used  Flash The fantastic thing about SnowDays is that you can share your work. Here’s  a link to that snowflake If you sit in the front page of SnowDays, you can watch the most recent snowflakes falling. If someone makes a snowflake while you’re watching it, it gets an arrow pointing to it saying it’s new. I think the design encourages people to interact with others’ snowflakes, which I find neat. There was a whole community around SnowDays back then. People called themselves “flakers”. The snowflakes can get rather elaborate. Here’s  one of my recent snowflakes https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/flake.webm The animation comes from how SnowDays draws the snowflake at around one cut per frame, so you’re looking at how it’s changed over each cut. There’s a trick behind inverting snowflakes. If you follow this set of cuts: You can cut into the negative space to bring out paper from nowhere! How does this work? The answer has to do with winding numbers. A cut is a closed curve. Even if you don’t close up the cut, SnowDays will close it for you. If you have a closed curve, you can find the  winding number See how the winding number can be greater than 1, if there’s multiple counterclockwise rotations. It can be negative if there are only clockwise rotations. Sometimes it cancels out to get 0, if there are the same number of rotations in each direction. Snowflakes follow the  nonzero-rule We have two closed curves. The first cut is a triangle going clockwise. The second one is a triangle going counterclockwise. Inside both triangles, the winding number is 0, so there’s paper. Between the triangles, the winding number is –1, so the paper is cut. Outside the triangles, the winding number is 0 again, so there’s paper. If you try this out on your own, you might notice that it doesn’t always work. This is because SnowDays tries to regularize cuts, which means it will sometimes try to reverse the direction of your cut so it goes the other way. I don’t know the exact conditions when it does that. For example, try making these sequences of cuts and see what happens: Here’s a  sample snowflake made with this principle Here’s some snowflakes I made if you want to check them out. I’m pasting the numbers; you can look them up with the search. 9695916 13613955 14535436 14535457 14535555 There’s a list of featured snowflakes on this  old website 3660570 4794328 5874730 9612545 Hope this is a fun distraction while you’re waiting for decisions.

After **quite** the hiatus, ⁠ 01 *Checks watch* wow I was a sophomore last time I posted... yikes Academics-wise, last semester was quite a ride. A ride on a street with a lot of potholes. Though I told myself I would never
 
take 5 classes again at MIT, ⁠ 02 GUESS WHO IS IN 5 CLASSES AS WE SPEAK. some people never learn. I clearly enjoy lying to myself should . This thinking got especially spurred by some regrets, events, and decisions that have happened spanning the end of my sophomore year and this past summer. In a different world, I would probably wind up being a humanities major of some sort. I’ve been sad that at MIT I haven’t dabbled in humanities topics as much as I could have or wanted to. So, I feel happy that I took a leap this school year that I’ve wanted to do for a while. I moved around some of my extracurriculars for this year; I dropped a club I liked to try new things like dance. I’ve been learning more about photography after getting a camera. And I took a drawing class, which was the first art class I’ve ever formally taken.  For this drawing class, which is 21M.601, Drawing for Designers, our first assignment was to do something called gesture drawings. Basically, gestures are quick, 1-minute sketches of random things. You can think of it as a warm-up for drawing. For the task, I had to find 50 unique things on campus and spent a decent bit of time gesturing around MIT. Though ideally, I would eat 3 meals a day, most of the time I eat somewhere around 2.5 meals. 1 of them being lunch, the other 1 being dinner, and the .5 being some odd mixture varying from an actually nutritious, self-made smoothie to a box of raisins. On this day, I wound up buying lunch from one of the vendors in the Stud. Most food on campus is a tad expensive, so I often opt to make my own lunch, but the bowls at this Dominican place are pretty decent. I slowly ate my food as I trudged along through my assignment  For this assignment, I was supposed to time each drawing I made. I wasn’t supposed to take over a minute, so I used my phone’s timer to keep myself in check. When I couldn’t think of anything to draw on my second drawing out of fifty total, I proceeded to draw my phone. Not much more to it. I was sitting in Stud 2, one of the floors in the student center. Well actually, it was more like Stud 3 because it was on the upper floor of Stud 2’s Lobell Dining Court… which I guess makes it the 3rd floor of the building. Weird how that works out. Anyways, this was the view outside the window on that floor. There is a tree, and it faces Mass Ave, where Lobby 7 is. I didn’t get too much time to draw out the details, so I scribbled some of the features. Now that I think about it, I don’t see disposable plastic bottles too often around campus. People often have hydroflasks or some other type of thermos. Here, I draw a poland spring water bottle I saw on a table near me.  When I drew this one, I was still eating my lunch and saw the dolly-type-of-thing an MIT employee also eating lunch had. It was aluminum with painted blue parts. Perhaps he used it for moving stuff around? We will never know. The place I was at was pretty quiet, other than some subtle conversations. Some people were working on stuff, so I just drew them since they were rather stationary. Hopefully, they didn’t mind.  Dolly-MIT employee guy also had a can of coke with him, the normal kind. I don’t think he ever wound up drinking it while I was there. In Lobby 7, there usually are MIT keychains you can pick up. I’ve been using them since freshman year, though I’ve switched them out a lot. They tend to break after extended periods of use, and since I have my keys and ID on them, I use my keychain quite a lot. I recently learned that lots of people at MIT don’t carry their keys and just leave their doors unlocked. Which baffles me. Maybe it’s the city kid part of me, but that seems horrifying. This is a key chain I have on my backpack, featuring the peace sign in the colors of the Palestinian flag. For part of this past summer, I taught CS in Jerusalem to Israeli and Palestinian high schoolers, and when I wasn’t teaching, I got a few souvenirs. This one I bought in the old city of Jerusalem, near Al Aqsa mosque. During our first semester, when we were walking through the beautiful hallways of MIT on gather.io, MIT sent all 2024s a little car package. The package included some niche items, like an MIT golf ball, and this MIT 2024 beaver. I’ve had the beaver on my bag for about 2 years now, and the world may cease to exist if anything happened to the little fella. He has a little shirt that says MIT 2024 and looks significantly cuter than any of the other classes’ little beaver keychains.  My laptop. My comrade through psets, youtube, procrastination, and everything else. I got a decent laptop when I started MIT, and it has broken down on me multiple times. One day, I might have to do CPR on it. I have a bunch of stickers on it, including a Course 2 sticker which is now slightly awkward….  Last last January (2022), I taught through MIT’s Global Teaching Lab program in South Korea. With my 3 other teammates, we ran 2 weeks of hands-on STEM workshops for middle/high school students. On our last day, the host staff caught wind from one of my teammates that I REALLY wanted this plushie I had seen in stores, but I was hesitating to buy it. They got the plushie, named Choonsik as a parting gift, which was incredibly sweet. This Choonsik was a special New Year’s edition, so he is wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean clothes). I was hoping to bring Choonsik home when I went to South Korea over IAP this year to teach again for GTL, but my friend held him hostage :(. My headphones, which I love dearly. Though recently, I haven’t been wearing them much. You see, my blogger picture is pretty inaccurate now. I have decently long hair (by my standards). My hair is very curly and coily, but if I were to stretch it out it is roughly 6 inches long. So when I wear headphones with my hair, I leave a massive ridge in my hair as soon as I take them off. I love beanie season when I can wear my headphones in peace. This is… well was one of my favorite mugs. I probably haven’t gotten the chance to make it clear enough so far, but I am a very big ATLA fan. This mug is a Jasmine Dragon logo in Starbucks’ logo style. Sadly, I accidentally sent this mug flying off my desk one day, and it shattered. My semester went terribly since that faithful day. At MIT, we have an Ipad loaning program, so I have been borrowing an Ipad from MIT since I started. I’ve grown a bit attached to it, even though it is not mine at all. I also have an apple pencil, and I draw it in action. My plant! I’ve had this plant since freshman spring, so it is about two years old. Of my original 3 plants that started junior year, it is the last one standing :(. It has gone through hell and back (me forgetting to water it for an extended period of time), but it’s extremely resilient. I am a terrible plant parent, but I am happy it has made it through MIT alive so far. In fact, maybe it’s even been doing better than I have. Also during my freshman spring, I took Toy Product design, a class meant to serve as exposure to MechE. As we worked towards our final presentation, we made many posters, prototypes, and misc objects. This was a boat that we created for a poster that I am now hanging up on my wall.  At the moment, I live in East Campus, and unlike most students in other dorms except Baker, I have a sink. A sink is absolutely amazing to have in your room, and I will miss it a lot when I move elsewhere next year. Being able to brush my teeth at 3:28am with no one walking in… sublime. My room’s sink has a mirror right above it, so I can see my bedhead after I wake up. The previous room resident etched stuff into the mirror, which is interesting. Not sure why, but hope you are doing alright Tony. Sometime long ago, I got these bag clips that are shaped like owls. I mainly just use these clips for decor, and one of them bares a striking resemblance to the Duolingo bird. A frightening reminder to do my daily lesson. Before someone lectures me to not hang stuff from pipes, trust me this is safe. Just trust me. I’ve been doing Taekwondo at MIT for 3 semesters now, and I’ve gotten 4 belts so far. I’ve been hanging them up in my room and adding the old belt each time I get a new one. So far, I have the white, yellow, green stripe, green, and blue stripe belts.  Oh, remember when I said most people have hydroflasks? Well, this is my hydroflask. It’s eggplant colored since I lost my original one. UPDATE: I lost this one too. I bought this lamp freshman spring. I came into my Macgregor room and absolutely hated the lighting. Petey said something along the lines of “it looks like a ufo is taking you” to me freshman year, which was 100% accurate. On Zoom, my face looked dark and the only thing illuminated was my hair. In my room, I set up LED light strips that I bought online. They are pretty cool light strips if I do say so myself since I can sync them to music and make my room look like a discount disco party. I drew the remote for those light strips. This reminds me I have another roll of light strips I can program with an Arduino, but I never got around to actually figuring out how to use those… It really wouldn’t be MIT if my room did not have some type of insect problem. Or should I say arachnid problem? It’s much better right now, but my room usually has lots and lots of spiders. I’ve found them just vibing in a corner pretty often. One time. one was on my plant though which was not terribly great. To be honest, I don’t mind them as long as they don’t jump-scare me. Another time I was walking to bed, and a spider went down right in front of my eyes, about an inch away from my face. It did not survive the encounter as I panicked. This picture is actually related to my LED strips. I put a command hook on my wall near my strip’s sensor so that I could hang a speaker right there. That way, my lights sync properly to the music, and not to conversations that might also be happening in the room This one is terribly cursed. But I was running out of ideas to draw. I’m not sure if I’ve ever mentioned this here before, but I’m a rather big Avatar the last Airbender fan. Very big fan. Over the past summer, with some of the other MIT students I was working with, I watched The Last Airbender. You might know where this is going. Yes, I watched  that  movie. A terrible movie that made me want to throw hands with everyone who approved of it. It was a terribly scarring experience. My memory is a bit hazy on this one. I think I meant to draw a tent I saw on campus. MIT often puts up tents for major and minor events. It’s quite a common occurrence when the weather is warmer. Whenever the tents leave campus, the grass under them being all dead and crusty is sadly also a common occurrence. MIT’s campus has many different types of lamps and lights, and this was one of them. Nothing particular to see here. I sometimes work at Hayden Library on campus, which is conveniently 1 minute away from my dorm room. In fact, I can see it from my window. Hayden has a cafe, which serves up some drinks like chai lattes and iced teas. I generally tend to drink whatever I buy really fast, and this time was like no other. Only the ice remained. I want to say this one is a person working on a couch. But on second thought, I am not quite sure what I was going for. Yes, I might only have had a minute to draw this… but I’m still confused about how I produced something of this quality.  I have a rather large collection of lip balm. I am pretty forgetful, so I misplace a lip balm somewhere in my room, can’t find it, and buy a new one after dealing with crusty, chapped lips for days on end. Then the day after I buy a new one, I find the old one. At this point, I have a berry, peach, mint, and coconut lip balm. There are probably more to come.  My glasses. If anything happens to my glasses, I am doomed. I wear my glasses pretty much every day since my eyesight is very blurry without them, and I would need to squint to be able to catch most things. That being said, if you put up 3 fingers in front of me and ask “hOw ManY fInGeRs aM i HoLdiNg uP,” I will be able to see perfectly out of spite. More plants! This was a plant in the student center, just vibing on the floor above me. For this one, I drew my hand. Drawing hands is something I’ve always found rather difficult to do, so I would say I am rather satisfied with this quick sketch looking pretty good. Here, I drew my shoes at the time. I bought these shoes at home in New York and brought them to campus. Perhaps I don’t know the right places, but clothing in Boston feels very expensive. So generally, I buy stuff in NYC when I go home, and bring it back with me to campus.  In the student center (stud), there are a bunch of very tall potted plants (trees?) on either the second or the third floor. They are a nice addition to the study area that is there. The stud is being renovated soon, so I am not too sure what will happen to the plants, but hopefully, they return next fall. I saw a person working on something using their mac in the stud. MIT is pretty split on windows vs mac users, so it’s rather common to see both of them being used.  As I was doing these drawings, I bumped into an HS friend who is an MIT ‘23. We talked for a bit, and she passed me some items I could draw for inspiration. The first of these (I think) was a clear water bottle with a long straw going through it. Hydrate or diedrate folks. The next of these was a nice wallet she had. I don’t remember what color it was, but it was fun to draw, it kind of felt like drawing a book. My brass rat! During sophomore year, every class gets a ring designed by members of their class, the Ring Committee. There is first a premiere event, where the ring is presented. Then, there is a delivery event, where you get your rings, take snazzy photos, and get covid (if you are me). I got a Ultrium ring, which is the ring people tend to wear daily. A fun fact was that I was on the committee that selected our year’s Ring Committee o__o This was the aforementioned friend’s AirPods case. I, as a good Android user, do not have AirPods, though I might try to get some non-Apple earbuds soon. I have headphones (like the ones that go over your head), but as I mentioned before, if I wear them, I’m left with a trench in the middle of my hair. So earbuds might be a good investment. Since I live in a cook-for-yourself dorm, I (sometimes) get groceries. Personally, I find Boston grocery prices to be really expensive, especially near MIT. I find it funny when people tell me New York is more expensive than Boston food-wise, but maybe that is just because I know where to look for food in the Bronx/NYC. My two saving graces in Boston are Daily Table and Aldi’s, which I both really love. Sometimes I go to Aldi’s to stock up on snacks and non-perishables, and I drew this fruit bar I got from there. It was absolutely disgusting and I never bought it again. In the past year, I’ve taken planes quite a few times. Around 9 times actually. Most of these times were for doing MISTI, MIT programs where you teach/intern abroad. On international flights, they tend to give you the headphones with the jack, so I keep one in my bag in case, for some reason, I immediately need a pair of earbuds. Even though my phone does not have a headphone jack. When I was teaching CS over the summer in Jerusalem, one of my students made this bracelet for me on the last day :)). I really love it and I’ve been wearing it since, and I gotta say I’m surprised it has stayed on my wrist so long. I can’t really take it off, and I’m not going to cut it either, so until it breaks do us part. This is my laptop adapter so that if I ever need to use an HDMI cable, I am ready. I also use this sometimes for the projector I have in my room. I bought a cheap trajectory screen I can put up and remove as a please, which was a solid investment for watching the world cup last semester. A quarter. All the money in my account in a single drawing. My phone! Lots of people ask me why I have a random leaf in the back of my phone case. I picked this leaf off a tree last year in San Francisco when I went there for 3 days to participate in a CS event. It’s been chilling in my phone case since along with a sticker I printed saying, “I’m tired.” I have a few mugs, but I don’t believe this is one of mine. Considering the last 3 of these drawings were done in my floor’s lounge, it probably was someone else’s mug. As for my mugs, the three I currently have are a MecheE mug from my old days as a Course 2 before I sold my soul to coding, a mug from the CS summer program I taught at, and a pretty new one my friend gave me from when she was in London. Have I mentioned before that I’m a big Avatar (not the blue people.) fan? Perhaps I’ve talked about this before, but I used to have one that was a Starbucks-inspired logo for Uncle Iroh’s Jasmine Dragon. But it is no longer with us. It is drawing 14. A faucet. I’m starting to run out of ways to go on tangents for rather simple objects I drew. And we have reached the end! For the end, we have a decoration which is a stick with a few pinecones attached to it. I’ve seen it before many times, but never actually paid attention to it until I was desperate for one last thing to draw as the deadline neared.  I originally meant to post this around the start of last semester… and let’s just say things don’t always go as planned. I spent a bit of time editing the part about my semester from the present tense to the past tense. On the bright side, I have lots more art I worked on last semester I can now share, like my end-of-semester portfolio for the class. You can probably tell which ones were more rushed than others 😅. Having never taken an actual art class before, I think I was rather happy with my progress throughout the course. I tend to get a bit frustrated easily with things art-related when something goes awry, but I got better with that as the semester went on. I don’t know if I will take more drawing classes at MIT (I don’t know if we have any more than this one, to be honest), but it was a great learning experience that I’m happy to look back on as I start a new semester.

Paper notes I hate taking notes with my iPad, so I went back to good old pen and paper notes this semester. I’m still writing up problem sets on my iPad though because that makes it easier to submit the pset on Gradescope. New UROP I switched  
UROPs ⁠ 01 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. Undergrads get to work with actual research, and can get paid or earn credit for it.

I knew I was coming in with less experience than my peers, so I decided to make up for less experience with more time—at least 4-5 hours a day dedicated to programming. That was a good decision. I found out that I actually enjoy coding enough to do it for hours at a time without getting bored. But  I can also tell that the 6.009 staff took steps to improve the class since last spring. I was wrong for beating myself up over it last year, but I was right for being pissed off at 6.009. Baseball I’ve been a casual enjoyer of baseball since high school, but lately I’ve had the deep urge to learn about baseball statistics. Who knows why.

since it’s my last semester, I’ve been trying to spend more time working on campus. or rather, I feel guilty whenever I work in my bed since I could be exploring a new and fascinating part of the institute I’ll soon be graduating from!! to try to get myself out of my room more, I embarked on a quest to document the best study spots at MIT. most of these are relatively well-known—don’t anticipate many niche hidden gems since those will continue to be gatekept by the student body :)) I tried to find them, I promise :)))) I started by polling my friends to find out where they like to study on campus and what they enjoy about their most-frequented spots. The most popular locations were: I also asked them to choose the most important characteristics of a given study space: other factors that they wrote in include: with all this in mind, let’s dive into my definitely not comprehensive list of well-trafficked spots! Previous Next Previous Next Previous Next

Lately everyone seems to be asking me how I am. Are you doing okay? How are you feeling? What’s your emotional state? I find the doting quite flattering, to be honest, and it’s been very sweet to see how many people do care about me, people I wouldn’t thought to have considered me a friend taking time to check in on me. Another common thing I seem to hear alongside these check-ins are “I don’t know a Cami without Raymond.” I started seeing Raymond
 
in October of my freshman fall. ⁠ 01 It only just hit me at last night's blogger check-in that I literally broke the November rule despite being one of the biggest proponents of said rule, but let's not dig too deeply into that right now. All of my college experience up until this point has been a joint venture, a co-op adventure of sorts. I don’t regret any of my time spent in the relationship; in fact, I think it was incredibly good for me to be in it. I learned so many things about myself, about who I am, about who I want to be, about who I   be. But I’m grateful that for the indefinite future I’m plunging into the unknown and seeing what it’s like to no longer have a safety net. I’m trying to navigate things on my own, like how do you make friends without relying on the same people you’ve been relying on for the past four years? How does one even go about
 
dating in college or finding people to talk to? ⁠ 02 Note that I plan to be single for the next however many months or years or whatever, this is more just talking about the college dating experience. I’ve been spending a lot of time with my friends — friends from my internship last summer, friends from my sorority, friends from Twitter, friends from essentially all my various communities that I’m a part of. I hadn’t realized how large my web extended, how many people I actually do consider a friend. I think I often forget that the world is a lot bigger than my intimate ten (or so) person friend group that I spend every day with, and that it’s actually   to branch out. In addition to that, I’ve been picking up old hobbies again. I bought
 a new guitar. ⁠ 03 Yeah I play left handed guitar please dont bully me for it One of the sillier benefits, I think, of going through heartbreak is also being able to reconsume old media that you couldn’t fully appreciate in the moment. I rewatched  Someone Great Fleabag Supercut by Lorde Eventually by Tame Impala About You by the 1975 I’m still definitely sad (lol); I hope that’s, like, obvious. But I think there’s something very beautiful about the end of a relationship. I’ve never had one end positively before and this is the first one I’ve experienced where it’s amicable and it’s been a really interesting space to explore, how two people who used to be so close just unfortunately have outgrown each other and their respective needs, and coming to that mutual decision. I think this is just the beginning of the (long, painful) growth process, but even in 48 hours after the fallout I think I’ve learned a lot already. The loneliness is discernible to a near agonizing point. Couples on campus are just so much more visible than they used to be. The presence of merely married couples or couples that live together mocks me in some way, jeering at me, as if to rub in my face the fact that I couldn’t settle down. My friend group, obviously, has been strained. In the breakup, we’ve agreed to “share custody” of our friend-children. I’m grateful that the breakup wasn’t nasty, that way no one has to choose sides, but it’s still difficult to just be a part of. I get nervous just thinking about it. My friendships in general have also just strained. I feel like I can’t talk to people as freely as I could before. I wonder which of his friends are still going to wave to me in the hallways. I wonder where I’m uninvited to or what people are saying behind my back. It’s really fucking scary. I feel like I have to occupy my mind 24/7 or else I’ll slip into a state of thinking too much, and I’m scared if I think too much, I’ll regret my decision. That really is my biggest fear, the fear that I’ve chosen wrong. That I will never find the stability and love that I found in these past three years, that I fucked up. And so I don’t ask myself that question. I keep going, like a little machine, taking on task after task so my mind doesn’t rest enough to entertain that possibility at all.

Back in October of 2022, I flew from Boston to LA and drove two hours to San Diego to attend  TwitchCon 2022 I went with my best friend of 14 years, Ethan, who is a student as UCSD and he kindly let me stay over at his place for the weekend. For those who do not know, Twitch is video live streaming service that primarily focuses on video game live streaming. It’s been around for a while (I’ve actually been using it since its initial launch believe it or not) but I would say
 
it blew up quite large over the quarantine period. ⁠ 01 It was actually big back then too but I think this is around the time where the concurrent viewership started to blow up to the 400,000+ range. TwitchCon is a semi-annual gaming convention to celebrate Twitch as a live streaming platform! Content creators from all over the globe come to TwitchCon to hang out, party, throw events, make content together, and more. Vendors and sponsors like gaming companies, hardware vendors, and more also come to show off their stuff and give away freebies. It’s ultimately a really fun and exciting time. There’s also a lot of panels talking about being LGBTQ+ in gaming, being a content creator of color, or being disabled in the gaming space and how to make Twitch and really just gaming in general a more open and accessible field. One of my professors,  T.L. Taylor Coming in to the weekend I knew it was going to be incredibly hectic. I tried to make a list of events I wanted to go to and creators I wanted to meet. I knew I wanted to go to the Minecraft Youtube meet and greets to meet people like Sapnap, GeorgeNotFound, Dream, Quackity, and others. I also am a huge fan of OfflineTV and had my eye on their meet and greets and booths as well. I made sure to pack a polaroid, some film, and a Sharpie because I had a really cute idea of taking photos with all the content creators I met and having them sign the polaroid. Previous Next I met  . These are just the polaroids. Niki Nihachu was incredibly sweet and I told her how much it meant to me to see women in the gaming space. I also LOVED meeting xQc who has been one of my favorite content creators for a long, long time (maybe since 2016 or 2017?) He’s such a sweetheart in person. Alexandra Botez complimented my skirt which made me cry a little. I also loved meeting Syd and Peter and they’re just so gorgeous and stunning in person I was shaken to my core. I also got a lot of photos just with my phone. Previous Next Meeting Steve was such an important meeting for me because I’ve been watching this man literally since I was in middle school and his dogshit humor influenced me a lot. Our conversation went like this: Me:  Hi,  I’m so sorry I’m nervous but I’ve been watching you since the fourth grade and I’m like a senior in college now Him: Yeah you seem really nervous that’s so embarrassing for you Me: Right yeah I’m just gonna go shit myself out of embarrassment Him (this is a reference to how he had to leave in the middle of the panel to “poop”): Hey shitting myself is a very sensitive topic for me Me: Yeah you should’ve just shit yourself on stage Me: Is it okay if I take a selfie with you and pull my mask down? Him: yeah for sure Me: Yeah don’t worry I’m just gonna cough all over you Him: Perfect good thing I’m antivaxx Me: Even better I was so happy to have :’) successfully bantered with literally one of my favorite people ever and it was just such a good and wholesome interaction. Meeting Toast literally made my whole TwitchCon. I have this sequence of photos where I tell him that my mom told me to go to TwitchCon just so I can meet him because she loves him (true story!) and I was able to get his genuine reaction to that on camera. Scarra and Michael also giggled and it was a great time. I wish I could’ve told Michael how much MIT students adore him, but  Nisha Previous Next I also won a ton of swag from this event, like some keyboard caps, a free gaming mouse and mousepad, and a really nice RGB keyboard. It was overall such a great time and I’m so happy I went! I would 100% go again next year and it was so nice to have a break from the MIT Bubble.

Meet Catsby: He was a sweet boy who loved food, sleeping in the dirt, and sunbathing. Sadly, he passed away shortly after I moved to MIT. I was devastated, but luckily, I still have many pictures to remind me of him. This semester, I was fortunate enough to take a class at MIT.nano where I immortalized one of those pictures as a solar cell! (The cat to the right is a random cat I found online.) The inspiration MIT.nano is MIT’s state-of-the-art research facility for nanoscale science and engineering. Built near the end of 2018, it houses the most sophisticated nanofabrication facilities of any university in the world. At the heart of it is a cleanroom with a vast array of advanced (and expensive) machinery used to control and measure material properties down to the nanometer – that’s a billionth of a meter! Since MIT.nano’s inception, researchers have used the space for all kinds of high-tech research, from  paper-thin loudspeakers  to  new drugs to treat cancer . Almost everything created there is super exciting, so naturally, the MIT.nano staff want students to get excited about it too. To that end, undergraduates like me get to take classes where we work in the cleanroom to design and fabricate our own nanotechnology. These classes range from 3-hour-long “etch a tiny image onto silicon” seminars (designed to show off the facilities) to semester-long courses where students create novel microelectronic devices using MIT.nano’s equipment. This wafer contains everyone’s submitted pictures from this past IAP’s seminars. I’m taking one of those classes this semester – 3.155J/6.2600J (micro/nano processing technologies). In lectures, we learn about semiconductors and nanofabrication techniques; in labs, we apply that knowledge and make devices like microfluidic chips, thin-film transistors, and eventually a device that we design. Without a doubt, 6.2600 is the most magical and exciting class I’ve taken at MIT – and it has only been four weeks! The lectures are
 
fun and engaging ⁠ 01 Shoutout to Jorg’s top-tier memes and Jesús’s wholesome efforts to learn everyone’s name. 
fair ⁠ 02 We get extra late hours whenever the course staff take too long to grade our homework. Our first lab project is fabricating solar cells from scratch, which involves testing fifteen different designs to see which is the most efficient: Each silicon wafer can fit 25 solar cells, so we had space left for other designs. The original plan was for students to submit pictures to be etched inside those extra spaces as decorations, but I felt more ambitious –  I wanted to take a picture and turn it into a full-on solar cell. Creating the design Jorg, the lecturer in charge of our labs, was totally on board with my plan. The only problems were that they had never done something like that before, and I only had two days before the lab to pull it off. Luckily, I had taken one of the IAP seminars a few weeks earlier, so I had a vague notion of how it would work. The main idea was to use different-sized squares to represent the brightness of each pixel, with large squares being brighter in the final image. It’s pretty much the opposite of halftone dots used to print old newspapers. I wanted to expose as much silicon as possible to the sunlight (so the solar cell would be decently efficient), so I also needed to squash the image’s
 
dynamic range ⁠ 03 The difference between the lightest and darkest parts of the image. Finally, I needed to connect everything to collect the generated electric current. I initially coded something complicated to minimize the amount of excess metal, but after some back-and-forth emailing with Jorg, I settled on simple vertical stripes to collect the current instead. This was the final result: Fabricating the solar cell Gowning up to enter the cleanroom. Using hydrofluoric acid (the same stuff Walter White used to dissolve bodies in Breaking Bad) to etch the wafer after patterning. The results of day 1. Rinse (with acid) and repeat. All the solar cells together. How effective was the final product? The electrical testing results from day 3 for Catsby ’ My four custom solar cells actually ended up performing surprisingly well. In particular, the Catsby solar cell  achieved an efficiency of 7.7%! For reference, the best-performing of the fifteen solar cells we tested had an efficiency of 9.3%. Out of the four custom solar cells I made, the one with Catsby ’s image was also the second most-efficient cell, with the Megamind solar cell narrowly beating it by 0.3% in efficiency. Of course, these numbers pale in comparison to the best solar cells available today, with some designs achieving efficiencies of  over 45% For your enjoyment, here are more pictures of my little ray of sunshine to brighten your day: Previous Next #cats #MIT.nano #Solar Energy

In my AP psychology class, we learned about the different theories of emotion; specifically what comes to mind is the  , where the experience of emotions hinges on two things: (1) the physiological arousal itself and (2) the interpretation of that arousal. Obviously this theory is wrong; emotions can be experienced before we think about them, but I think a lot about (2) in particular. These past couple of days I’ve been wading in a sea of big thoughts and feelings, but I can’t individually identify them. It feels a lot like trying to untangle jewelry; I try to undo it, ruffle through my thoughts to find a thread I can tug on, but find that the chains are tangled too deeply and I ultimately give up until I have the patience to think on it again. I am going through a breakup. Maybe I should’ve read  Rona’s post  thing. I am walking away from something I know is good for me, but I know it is not what I need right now. I have been in committed relationships back to back since I was 14. I haven’t been alone in life for longer than three months in this time and have relied on some partner as an anchor for these past seven years. And now, as I graduate, I’m always, always,   thinking of the future.  In a blogpost I wrote not too long ago that is now honestly probably the most painful to reread I’ve come to realize that this blogpost was not only about the fear of leaving MIT, it was the fear of leaving MIT and jumping into a future that was so solidly in place for me. It was the fear of committing to a single, defined path. I’ve been talking with my friends and I told them that my biggest decision right now was understanding whether this fear of commitment was a personal character flaw I needed to push through, or if this just meant I wasn’t in a place to settle down yet. And then one of my friends laughed loudly and said “I think commitment issues at 21 years old is fucking normal.” I so desperately want to think that I’ve found the one. I so desperately want to be done and settle down and say that I’ve found the love of my life and that this is what the rest of my life is going to look like, but I can’t because saying that would simply just not be true. I’m not ready. I need to be stupid and alone and I need to fuck up and I need to live on my own and just be a complete and utter dumbass for a little bit. I am not ready to talk about kids or marriage or moving in. And I think really that’s what this whole senior year has been building up to–this realization. I finish that blogpost with: And all of this is still very true; I think the place that I will find the most growth is on my own. I’m lucky to have loved and been loved by someone this deeply and genuinely; I think it’s a very rare thing to experience and I learned so much in this relationship. But for now, I push on.

Growing up, I loved to mock tourists. Precisely, of those who would take about a hundred pictures of the most random things you can imagine: palm trees, iguanas, piña coladas. To me, they were nothing but pathetic. What did they find so intriguing about a green tree, scary reptiles, and a drink? I could not understand. Nonetheless, today, as I walk along the Charles River and stop in the middle of the road to take a picture of the beautiful skyline and fall-colored trees, I think back to my childish behavior. How clueless was I? Picture taken: 11/3/2022 The first time I saw a glimpse of a sunset from Maseeh, I stopped what I was doing and ran straight out the door. I wanted to witness the magnificence of a Cambridge twilight, a previously unfamiliar event to me. And, let me tell you, such did not disappoint. Its hues of pink and orange merged majestically to yield the softest and calmest dusk I had ever seen. I watched it in awe for several minutes, with nothing rolling through my mind. I was incredibly mesmerized by the sudden change in scenery that nothing else could infiltrate my thoughts. I could not hear the usual car horns and music that filled Mass. Ave. I could not see the bunches of people crossing the road. Instead, I could only listen to the gush of wind blowing against my hair and see the color-changing buildings reflecting the gloaming sunlight. Picture taken: 09/21/2022 I was dormant for over ten minutes, watching the sunset go from its blush glory to a darker one full of city lights. It was stunning. Too stunning at times, which made it feel almost unreal. Back home, the nightfalls were warmer, with shades of gold and red. They, too, were captivating, but to me, they were expected, unlike the ones here in Massachusetts. Similar to the subtle disparity in twilight coloring, I noticed a contrast in the animals roaming in the wild as my time here passed. On campus, furry animals like squirrels and bunnies climb up the trees or play in the leaves. To me, that only occurred in movies. So, I jumped the first time I saw a rabbit wandering through the bushes. The jumpscare made my hands tremble and my heart pound tremendously fast. I had to close my eyes and control my breathing to regain composure. It took me several long seconds to hone my panic, but after achieving calmness, I looked around to see if anyone else had been frightened like me. I was surprised to see that no one else had been. I was the only absurd person standing in front of McCormick, catching my breath because I had just seen a normal animal merely exist. It took time to adjust, but I grew to like the innate animals of Cambridge. After a few days from my initial jumpscare, I felt no longer threatened by their presence; I grew to like it. It brought a smile to my face to see them hopping around the grass field. One day, I felt even confident enough to dare and hold a bunny in my arms at an event hosted by my dorm building. I became so attached to the little black-and-white creature that I tried to convince my roommate, who is also Puerto Rican, to adopt one for our room. Obviously, she knocked sense into me by stating that “pets are not allowed in dorms,” but a girl can only dream, right? I found adorable how it moved its little nose, had these large black eyes that shimmered with the light, and fit perfectly in my arms. Picture taken: 08/31/2022 Growing up, I had no pets; however, I still believe animals strongly impacted my upbringing. For example, my childhood bedroom was next to a palm tree that hosted many bird nests over the years. So, I became accustomed to waking up to the sound of birds singing. I miss it sometimes. It used to be a charming and peaceful manner to start my day. I attempted to emulate it by setting my alarm ringtone to a bird chirping, but it was not the same. Also, it never woke me up, defeating its immediate purpose. Living in the states has brought many experiences I had never lived before. Just the other day, for instance, I carved my first pumpkin. My friend, Ola, took me to a ChemE pumpkin carving competition, where teams competed for a prize. At first, I was thrilled as I had never done it before. Ola could sense my excitement and thus assigned me the crucial task of picking out our pumpkin. I was so invested and ready that when the time arrived, I meticulously scanned the numerous vegetable options. I looked at their marks, sturdiness, and size. Ultimately, I chose what I thought was the most appealing. Yet, when I brought it to our workstation, Ola looked at it, made a revolted face, and expressed, “That is ugly.” She then picked it up and switched it for a bigger, rounder, and more orange pumpkin. After that first incident, she acquainted me with the steps to follow. “First, we cut the top, take the seeds out, draw our design, and then carve the pumpkin.” It all seemed very straightforward. So after she completed the first step, I volunteered to take the guts out of the pumpkin. And, before I proceed, let me say this: What was that? Sticking my bare hand to scrape out the insides of a pumpkin was foul. Midway, Ola had to intervene and finish off because I could not. My hand and fingernails were covered in the sticky pulp residue that smelled like the pumpkin ravioli Costco sales. I was so appalled by the mess that I kept making faces at the poor, innocent pumpkin. Picture taken: 10/27/2022 Looking back now, I realize it was not that bad, and I was exaggerating, but someone (and by that, I mean Ola) should have informed me of what to expect. We finished our pumpkin by carving out windows and a door because our vision was to have the pumpkin serve as a house for a more miniature pumpkin. I think it turned out beautiful, even though the judges disagreed. Comical moments like these have made me appreciate my life here in Massachusetts. They also have given me a potent desire to share it with everyone from back home. A couple of weeks ago, I had my best friend, who happens to know me since birth, visit me. During his weekend-long stay, I took him all over campus to my classrooms, the Dome, and the Stud. I, as well, took him around Boston, as he had never been. One night after a long day of exploration and much walking, he says, “I can see why you like it here. You seem happy and at home.” Such a remark seemed insignificant at the time, but now as I ponder upon it, I can see the deepness it carries. Picture taken: 05/0132022 I decided to leave Puerto Rico and come to the United States to pursue my studies. I presumed it was the right choice since I would fit better here than at home. And to this day, I stand by my choice. At MIT, I have found my people—those who share my interests and motivations and push me forward. Nevertheless, my family and my community are not here. They are 1,694 miles away, where I was born. My lives in Puerto Rico and Cambridge are very distinct. Firstly, In Puerto Rico, I am a daughter and an adventure-seeking gal ready to soak in the bright Sun of the tropical. In Cambridge, I am a student, a friend, and a nerd, always covered in gloves, a hat, and an oversized coat, prepared to take upon any challenge. I am a thus different version of myself, depending on my geographical location. Yet, although distinct, I love both. Coming here to MIT has allowed me to realize this and become closer to each one. #guest blog #puerto rico

parkinson’s law asserts that work expands to fill the time allotted to it, like a gas does. so i’m telling myself that i need to get this post up by tonight, and though i just started writing this post i’m confident that it’ll work. i’m only taking three classes this semester. three! that’s the least number of classes i’ve ever taken in mit, and the least number of classes i can take while maintaining  full-time status f1 visa i’m taking 6.5060 [6.827]  algorithm engineering i’m also taking 6.S050  programming language design advice for picking classes fonts post webdev post mit graphic identity post the last class i’m taking is 18.218 topics in combinatorics. i took this class my freshman spring as well, and  wrote a post about it ramsey’s theorem this semester, i’m seeing some of my student group efforts come to fruition. a few months ago i was being sad about how  i stopped caring about these things sipb its first ten-day game i’m looking forward to going to east hill farm dance weekend, which starts this friday. lots of my friends in tech squares are going to be there! and i’m hoping to use it as motivation to start working on that square dancing blog post i keep promising i’ll write, oops. i’m also looking forward to running my first guild game! it’s happening the weekend after the next one, it’s called an aquarium auction, and it’s kinda like james bond in the scp universe. i’ve spent the last few weeks writing it on-and-off. while it’s only around 10k words, it’s a lot of editing and rewriting, because i have no idea what i’m doing, but it’s fun. and i could be doing more things, you know. i could always be doing more things. but the thing about non-class work, and projects and such, it’s that they can take as much attention as you can give. i’m sure i can take on another project or two. but, do i want to, when i’m having fun sinking time on my existing projects? and the thing about me is that  i use my work as a coping mechanism

content warnings: suicide mentions I think oftentimes it’s very easy to get caught up in the daily metronome of life, especially when you’re on a set schedule. Every day, I wake up, I work out, I go to class, I talk to my friends, I do work, I head home, I sleep. Next day. Repeat. Next day. Repeat. My friends and I have been talking about lately how we recycle the same topics over and over again. Every day it’s a conversation about how Raymond and I are doing, how it’s our last semester, what guy someone is dating, how much work someone has. I think that’s what I hate most about this time of year. I’ve never had a good spring semester at MIT, or, my falls were always better, at least. I find that by the time February and March rolls around things feel tired, they feel already done. It’s just a crawl to the end of the school year before you can do summer things. But now I stand at an awkward place where I don’t really want to graduate, but I don’t   want to do the whole school thing anymore. But I think one of the benefits of this time of year is that I tend to do a lot more thinking. The weather is colder, usually snowy (it is right now), and people usually become a lot more hosed, so you have a lot of time to yourself to just think. These past four years have been a whirlwind and there are moments where I feel like I haven’t truly learned everything I needed to at MIT. But in these moments of reflection, I’ve realized that every semester really has taught me something important, some greater, grand life lesson that I hope to carry with me into the future. Perhaps best explained in  one of my earliest blogs . I came into MIT with a lot of hopes and ideas of what I was going to do. I was going to dive in head first, I was going to take the  classes possible and be in five different extracurriculars and make things in my free time and go to the gym everyday and cook food and, well, you get the point. Freshman fall is   to be a reality check for baby students. It’s why MIT so graciously gives us  P/NR I’ve mentioned time and time again that I have  trauma carried a lot of that with me into college my high school self with this person I was becoming now in college I think still now I struggle with this. I’m often unsatisfied with the person I put forth, but I think my freshman spring was where I really got that first taste of intrinsic change, using the time at home  to reflect on the then and now My sophomore fall was by far my most difficult semester at MIT. I was in a house where I had sour relationships with my housemates, I was close to failing all my classes, and worst of all, I had started thinking of suicide again. This kind of came as a shock to me because I hadn’t felt that way since high school and those feelings came from feelings of social isolation, of losing my friends in high school. At MIT, though, I figured I had solved all those things. I had friends that cared about me. What could possibly stop me now? Surprisingly, it was academics. It was the feeling of running freely and openly at MIT to only slam headfirst into a brick wall, realizing  that I wasn’t smart enough for this school had never really felt it to such a drastic extent. It seemed as though no matter how much time or effort I poured into my classes, I still failed to grasp the concept. It was as though I needed double, triple, if not quintuple the time it took the average MIT student and I felt like a failure. I began really internalizing these doubts and fears, feeling useless and stupid. I started jeopardizing my relationships, both platonic and romantic, by taking out this anger and fear onto them. And ultimately I came very close to attempting suicide. But of course I survived and pushed through and  realized that failing was simply something I was going to have to co-exist with Despite coming to this great realization, I was  having a hard time putting these words into action I remember feeling a lot of anger during this semester —  why were people doing this to us? Is this really how I want to spend the rest of my life? Ultimately, it was these questions that made me realize  . And I soon re-declared
 
21E ⁠ 01 Humanities and Engineering joint major, as opposed to a full computer science major. My junior fall was my first semester as  a full 21E major taking three humanities classes and an easier technical class I essentially used this free time to really find my stride socially — I made friends in DPhiE, I started getting daily lunch and dinners with people, I befriended Mikey, Julian, and Savoldy, Eva was now fully part of our friend group. I was also just falling back in love with things I used to do, like  concertgoing making videos I took my newfound freedoms and had  thrown myself into a  My junior spring was essentially the time where all of the good things I got from my fall realizations started to show their ugly side. Filling your free time up with extracurriculars, pouring yourself into too much of your work, checking the clock and  realizing that your time is running out Once I finally  crashed In my senior fall, I took  three media studies classes intention  making? Why are you spending time on this and not that? What is the significance of a shot from this perspective instead of that one? What does this color bring to the table over this one? Around this time, too, my friend group was crumbling and I started thinking a lot about choice in this context. Who am I spending my time with? What does it mean to be friends with people who are no longer dating, who no longer want to be around each other?  What does it mean to truly be kind, to be   kind and a good friend? How does one go about becoming friends again This semester was a growing pains semester, where I learned how to be intentional with my time, choosing just exactly how I wanted to spend it,   I wanted to spend it with. This is a sentiment expressed in both my rap theory class and my internet studies class: there is no such thing as magic. Lupe Fiasco describes this more of like, in the music industry, creativity isn’t some magical thing that just happens. It is a skill that can be trained and this class is here to show us just how you can train it, remove the mysticism behind lyric writing and metaphors and all of that. My internet studies class essentially gets at the same thing — the Internet is not some magical force. There are tangible, physical processes that are occurring to make these things possible. Companies intentionally make it seem magical or out of reach to keep their audience in the dark, hiding the labor and work that goes into it to create a gap not only between consumer and company, but company and laborer, and laborer and consumer. Funnily enough, I think this idea also can extend to my personal life, too. I think adulting always seemed like some abstract concept that would just hit you once you “grew up”. I thought I’d turn 18 or whatever and just suddenly know how to do my taxes. Or I’d turn 25 and I’d just, I don’t know, understand how mortgages and car loans worked. But now that I’m deep in the throes of apartment hunting (blog coming soon) and adulting (blog coming soon), I realize that none of this is magic. These are things that all the adults in my life had to sit down and learn how to do, and though these processes are often mystified and hidden to make it harder for people, they are not impossible. They are attainable. I still have 98 days left, so I know there’s many lessons left to be learned. I also wanted to remind myself that college isn’t just for learning technical things or prepping for jobs; it’s also a place to get some (training wheels) life experience and I’m grateful for all the lessons learned at MIT thusfar. here at crisistextline.org

warning: mentions of anxiety, panic attacks, heart attacks. please skip this post if you’re not feeling well ted chiang’s short story  understand  explores the consequences of superintelligence. in the story’s climax, he introduces the idea of self-destruct commands – since the brain is just a collection of neurons that have no choice but to fire in response to external stimuli as well as to each other, there might be a set of input stimuli that, when perceived, causes the neurons in your brain to fire in a way which destroys you: “He means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener. Reynolds is claiming that the myth is true, that every mind has such a trigger built in; that for every person, there is a sentence that can reduce him to an idiot, a lunatic, a catatonic.” 1am:  i climb onto my bed and try to fall asleep. unfortunately my neighbors are having a lengthy conversation in our suite lounge, and it’s just loud enough that it’s preventing me from falling asleep but not so loud that it warrants me coming out to tell them to be quiet. it doesn’t help that i consumed a large drink at around 11pm, so every thirty minutes or so i have to get up to use the bathroom at the beginning of january i flew to sf for a job interview. i was pretty nervous for it – it was my first ever in-person job interview (that’s what happens when you go to college during covid) and i was also traveling alone and didn’t really know anyone in the company moreover, the night before my flight to sf, nfl player damar hamlin  collapsed  on-field after a cardiac arrest. i’ve always been the kind of person to worry about my health more than i should because of some conditions i went through while growing up and also because i’m worry-prone in general, so when i heard the news i couldn’t stop thinking: if damar hamlin, a top-tier athlete many times more fit than me, can have his heart stop working suddenly, the same can happen to me at any time if damar hamlin’s collapse didn’t occur in the middle of a football game, surrounded by teammates and medics who were paying attention to him and could administer cpr and heart shocks, he probably wouldn’t have gotten help quickly enough and wouldn’t have made it the natural conclusion from the previous two points is that my heart can give way at any moment, and if that happens i probably won’t get help quickly enough of course all these concerns are silly. it’s extremely unlikely any of these things will affect me anytime soon, and even if they do there’s no sense in worrying about them. that’s beside the point – when you’re anxious you focus on these kinds of scenarios regardless of how absurd they are, and you enter thought cycles where you keep telling yourself that all this is stupid and you should stop thinking about it but  you just can’t shake it off , and even if you do manage to focus on something else at some point your mind wanders back again and you can feel yourself beginning to spiral and you think  oh shit here we go again  and suddenly you have to start all over again and again and again my trip to sf was mostly fine. specifically it was fine when i was around other people; it was only when i was alone that the thought of  if something happens to you now, you’re fucked  would creep in, and i would have this dull tension in my abdomen that would persist for hours on end 3am:  i still haven’t been able to fall asleep, though at this point my neighbors have all gone to bed and stopped making noise. suddenly i’m acutely aware that i’ve locked the door to my room, and that means  if something happens to me at night nobody will be able to reach me for a while and  – i unlock the door. hopefully that makes falling asleep easier i get back into bed and feel my heart flutter. i’ve had the occasional heart palpitation for a while now and they’re supposed to be harmless, but  i begin to panic and my chest tightens and suddenly i’m breathing manually and wondering if i’m about to have a heart attack and i feel the free-fall sensation you get on the descents of rollercoasters and did i ever mention i hate rollercoasters? i get out of bed and open my laptop to respond to emails and texts since it looks like i’m not going to be falling asleep soon anyway. i consider telling someone what’s happening but nobody is awake, and besides, i don’t have the vocabulary to describe what i’m experiencing. i google  what does panic attack feel like  and read some articles and it doesn’t exactly line up with my case but i guess it’s close enough i get back into bed. the worst of the symptoms are behind me, but every half hour or so as i’m about to doze off my chest tightens and i panic and sit up straight, heart racing, and i think  please can this night just end already  and then i do some breathing exercises to calm down and prepare to sleep again. this repeats for the next two hours i’ve experienced various self-reinforcing thought loops in the past, but none as destructive as this one. the problem with anxiety about heart problems is that, if your psychosomatic symptoms are similar to mine at least, you tense up your abdomen and end up with a lot of chest tightness, and feeling that only makes you more anxious and if you have enough stress you can actually trigger heart problems yourself even if you’re physically in good shape during mit admissions blog meetings we sometimes joke about how, despite being extremely unathletic, i’ve written more athletics-tagged  posts  than any other active blogger. who could’ve guessed that keeping up with athletics would also be my downfall, that news about a football player would end up being the infohazard that threw my brain and body into dysfunction in a way not so different from what ted chiang described (though it is in a much more mild manner, thankfully) 5am:  at this point my stomach feels extremely empty because i’ve been awake this whole time and haven’t eaten anything since dinner. normally that would be an unpleasant feeling, but in this case it’s actually a good thing because the empty stomach feeling is stronger than the tight chest feeling, so i’m finally able to relax a bit dr k  used to always say that depression is the past-focused mind and anxiety is the future-focused mind (apparently this is attributed to  lao tzu ; dr k is just who i first heard it from). i’ve had my share of being fixated on the past or the future, and what i need now is a more reliable way to ground myself in the present for a while i thought the answer was something along the lines of meditation or breathing or bodily awareness. and it’s true that those things have been a tremendous help to me, but i think i also need to make some more fundamental changes in worldview 6am:  it’s starting to get bright outside, and i’m finally able to fall asleep, though not for long since i have to get up around 8am for class the following day i’m somehow able to pay attention in class despite being stressed and sleep-deprived. and going to class helps a lot – it’s nice to dive into stem and forget about everything else for a bit i read more about heart problems until i’ve once again convinced myself that occasional heart palpitations are in fact harmless. i decide to reduce my obligations and to not pursue any research for the semester, even though there were some people i was looking forward to working with. i commit to doing more cardio, because it seems like something that would help here and i wasn’t doing enough before anyway i talk to a friend with more experience than me. we talk about the differences in how we develop anxiety, and then they tell me to see a professional if i still feel bad in a week, or if my issues are making it hard to carry on with my regular life, but otherwise it’s probably fine it feels strange to say this but i’m not upset at all; i’m actually… a bit happy that my anxiety decided to rear its ugly head now. i’ve known for at least the past few years that i wasn’t managing stress and uncertainty in a healthy manner, and that sooner or later it would all resurface and i would have to figure out how to deal with it properly. this is a pretty low-stakes semester for me (done with graduation requirements,  job search winding down, etc) so there’s really no time better than the present for me to learn how to either solve or live with my problems in spite of everything, i believe i will figure this one out

*the footnotes are my current self doing commentary* :p I picked up ham radio as a hobby during quarantine. It started with a regular Wikipedia rabbit hole, but out of extreme boredom and morbid curiosity, I downloaded and read through a 400 page radio manual. I took the test, got my license, and joined a local  
ARES ⁠ 01 stands for Amateur Radio Emergency Services. I still miss them a bit. When I was in high school, everyone I met in ham radio was either old, white, or a man, and often a combination of all three. They told me that radio was slowly dying out.  
Back in ye olde days ⁠ 02 some people in Radio Society are probably immortal I thought the ham population would be small here, but about half a month after hanging out on Tetazoo, I discover that nearly half of the entire hall have radios. On top of the unexpected diversity,  I was shocked to find we also have our own frequency, affectionately named “Dumbass Brigade”. When Josh first programmed the frequency into my radio, I was happy about something radio related for the first time since I accidentally deleted my saved channels over the summer. I ended up spending 2 hours discussing aliens and  
meowing ⁠ 03 humans generally meow more than cats sus f I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to get to the club room. Walker wasn’t the most enjoyable building to navigate, especially due to the long flights of stairs and well-hidden, rickety elevators as an  
alternative ⁠ 04 the building's gotten easier to navigate, but the elevator still sucks 
QSTs ⁠ 05 ham radio magazine issues. they used to be bound like chapter books, and the older ones were literally falling apart by the seams 
QSL ⁠ 06 when ham radio operators make a contact, we try and send each other qsl cards, which are essentially post cards with our call signs on it. it's like a little souvenir that says 'i got someone from the other side of the globe!' or 'i talked to my next door neighbor on radio', and whatever applies in between 
two visibly annoyed guys ⁠ 07 deesh and hans One thing you must know about Radio Society, is that we are perpetually messy. Hans has been trying very hard to clean up the place for the past few weeks. It never works permanently. Every once in a while, somebody tries to clear up the space but it eventually gets filled with stuff just like it was before. And just when the room is about to explode from the amount of bookshelves, filing cabinets, radios, parts, and machinery, another person comes along and tries to clean the room. It’s a delicate balance that has yet to be broken for the past century of the club’s existence. While we sometimes have issues finding stuff with all the reorganization that’s happening, most people have been enjoying the newly created space and putting it to good use. Besides me, there are other frosh that consistently come to Triple Foxtrot. Eating pizza and listening to old guys talk about their health problems on HF is always fun, but after finishing our plates, we’ve spent a lot of our time messing around with Tesla Coils. 
interference ⁠ 08 we found out later that the tesla coil wasn't the cause, but it was pretty funny in the moment lol hans gets ignored for marshmallows I forgot how exactly people realized I could draw, but I’ve started doing a lot of art since coming to Radio Society. I started out using my skills for good. Hans wanted to print the current W1MX logo on a PCB, but the best he could get was a photo of the text on a QSL card. The current “logo” was just the W1XM in serif font, and on top of that, the curvature in the picture taken made it look like some sort of captcha. I offered to help with the revamping, and after some iterations on the back of a
 
Swapfest poster ⁠ 09 swapfest posters get used for everything. Other than advertisement, it gets used as scratch paper, insulation, temporary signage, structural integrity for a mini slayer exciter I built, etc etc. W1XM (UHF Repeater Association, not to be confused with W1MX Radio Society) logo with similar design elements because I think it looks cooler and totally not because I mixed up the two call signs But someone complained that it wasn’t readable, suggesting I put triangles in the black and white spaces in the “W”,”X”, and “M”. Other than completely ruining the design element, it kind of defeats the purpose of a new logo to add a bit more personality (it looked like regular serif). So since I couldn’t change it, I made alternatives. In fact I think they’re even
 
better ⁠ 10 i am proud to say that after a semester, the amogus logo gets used and drawn regularly on whiteboards. Previous Next The PCBs ended up being printed with the captcha. Soon, I started to gain a reputation for making various cursed drawings on the whiteboards. Aside from doodling amogi everywhere, I started making anime versions of all the Radio Society members. I produced a beautiful rendition of Daniel as a magical girl after he drew a gradient vector on the tail of my cat doodle.
 
Mitch’s ⁠ 11 ive also drawn mitch a few times, much to his annoyance. he doesn't really like being anime-ified On behalf of some anonymous members, Hans requested a full rendering of anime Deesh, arguably the most sus-looking person in Radio Society. I’ve specifically been requested to include the beret, the copper wire key-ring, and a kilt. It was a joy to draw and has since then been hung up on the wall. Some people here bicker a lot, though some tend to claim otherwise. They debate everything from the writing of the club constitution to matters as trivial as the pros and cons of Discord. In fact,
 
as I type this ⁠ 12 some time in October 2022 lol

will come to me ⁠ 14 i have picked up a lot since the beginning of the last semester, and i know roughly how to kinda use the station maybe, and i have some basic concepts, but i still feel far from being able to engage in regular conversation about the aforementioned techy things with the rest of them. the good thing is, everyone in the club is happy to teach as long as you ask questions. i made progress, but i have a ways to go. the station

I live with three other people. We have a relatively small kitchen, but it’s got a pretty good cabinet setup, with plenty of space for all our communal items like pots and tupperware, plus enough room for each of us to have at least a shelf of our own personal stuff. Two of my roommates have their own shelf; one has their own small cabinet. None of them are full. I have my own big cabinet, and baby… it’s like Tetris in there. This post, just for fun, is the unboxing of my cabinet! I’ll go through all the food I have stocked up, talk about where I do my grocery shopping, and try to defend my hoarder tendencies. You’ll have to be the one to judge if you’re convinced or not :P I will start by saying that I am a big snacker and always have been — that’s just how my metabolism works — and that this represents my cabinet at its fullest point, since I stocked up on everything when I had extra time over IAP. By the end of the semester, it will be much emptier as I eat through all my food supplies in preparation for moving out. Finally, I’ll note that most unprocessed foods, like tofu, fruit, and vegetables, are perishable and live in the fridge, so this is the least healthy segment of my food consumption >< Previous Next As you can see, there are two levels to the food situation here. (My bookshelves are also double-stacked like this. Perhaps I am not making the anti-hoarding case look good right out of the gate.) We’ll start with level 1: some people 
Daily Table ⁠ 01 The new uber-affordable grocery store in Central Square! They're relatively small so I buy most of my snacks elsewhere, but Daily Table is THE go-to for basic produce and proteins. I live like 5 minutes away now, which is the BEST, but even when I lived in East Campus, I would walk 20 minutes here because their prices are just so good. (And because most grocery stores are 20+ minutes from EC :/) 
container ⁠ 02 No clue where it came from, TBH, or what it originally held We’ve made it to level 2! There are some things here that are still visible from level 1, but I just labelled the new ones. of cans around, pineapple and beans and tomato and whatnot. Now that I live closer to grocery stores in Central Square (as opposed to East Campus which isn’t as conveniently located) I’ll just pick up what I need for the week. And that’s all folks! Hope you enjoyed this tour through my cabinet! Now you know the depths of my snacking habits, for which I will not apologize :) Although I cannot quite defend the number of duplicates I own of my favorite foods, I can promise you that it all (except for the steel cut oats) will get eaten. And if you know me and are in the market for some steel cut oats, hit me up! #food

I signed up for a healthy and sane schedule of 48 units and a UROP, but then I realized I could also sneak into a comic book class with the same professor that I’d had in Brazil. This was too tempting, so I am now taking 60 units and a UROP, which is not terribly more sane than previous semesters. I think it will be thrilling. do not look at the purple one shhh The goal: design and manufacture many many yo-yos. We’re in groups of 3-6, and we have all semester to CAD our designs, CNC molds for them, injection mold the parts, and assemble — each step of which involves a lot of iteration. I met with my team this weekend to finalize our design: the moon fish Tui and La from Avatar. Shout-out to Audrey for designing the fish in
 
Illustrator! ⁠ 01 and look out for a joint post from us when this project is done One of the seniors took the lead on guiding our design. She’s super competent, I loved bouncing ideas off each other, and I’m excited to see where this goes. I’m also hyped to learn the injection molding process. our whiteboard sketches This is my final core MechE requirement before  2.009 2.671 is unique in that rather than having one pset due each week, it has 1-3 assignments due throughout the week. Often one assignment is a pre-lab, due the day of one’s lab section, and another is a post-lab, due a few days after a lab. Other assignments are sprinkled in on any given day. I find this quite stressful as it requires you to shift other work around 2.671 in different ways each week. There is a lot of material to cover, and this is a CI-M; but it seems convoluted and difficult for difficulty’s sake. This class is a 6-unit follow-up to 2.678, a core class in MechE. I took it partially because I wanted to learn more about electronics, but mostly because I really enjoyed Prof Banzaert’s teaching style in 2.678. He’s down-to-earth and gives insightful lectures, which are easy to follow even for someone without much electronics experience. This class is mostly lab-based, which has proven to be quite fun given how many people I know in the class. I’ve been taking classes with MechE for 2 years now, and it’s lovely to come into each classroom and see many faces I know. this little man (who is also a fridge magnet) activates a magnetic sensor on the circuit board, which switches on the LED.

December. ⁠ 02 finals week, y'know? I currently draw stick figures and the language of comics is foreign to me, so I knew the best way to make myself begin was to take a class. I think that breaking down scenes into shot-by-shot and line-by-line scripts will help me create stronger scenes in graphic novels and prose. So much language can be carried by art, and what is ‘told’ versus ‘shown’ takes on new dimensions.  This class feels like a new perspective on old storytelling principles. I find myself extremely intimidated by drawing, probably because it’s the first thing I consciously gave up due to carpal tunnel. I bought a sketchbook for the first time since eighth grade. Walking around the art store, seeing this language I’d set down a decade ago, made me incredibly sad. I want to overcome this and fit drawing back into my catalogue of skills. I’m just gonna see how long that takes, how much it hurts. notes on converting Fahrenheit 451 and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep into comics, plus a self-portrait. This class overlaps with 2.008 lecture, so shshshsh don’t tell them I am
 
taking it! ⁠ 03 for this reason I may also have to drop it one day :( This year, 21L.504 is focused on race and identity in American  . It’s a perfect tie-in to my graphic novel writing class, especially since I don’t have extensive experience in comics to begin with. This class is also so fun because I love criticizing media. In middle school my big sister asked me to not talk about movies after we saw them because I always had something snarky to say. I have since toned down my inner hater… but sometimes I get to unleash it. The professor makes sure to highlight the strengths of the works we read, as well as the limitations imposed on authors who publish with big companies like Marvel and DC. It feels like we’ve struck a good balance between studying comics and criticizing them too. I’m learning the basics and historical origins of classic heroes, like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman. I’ve been introduced to many new comics, too. Last week, we read several issues of Nubia and Yara Flor/Wondergirl, two characters who are new tellings of the Wonder Woman mythos. For my UROP, I’m designing the hydraulics of a small scale tractor. It’s more or less in the global development space, which I want to learn more about in MIT and the world at large. The parts for the hydraulic circuit are full of oil. A group of Beast residents are training for a half-marathon! I personally found one half-marathon to be rather exhausting, but peer pressure is an excellent motivator. Maybe I will train this time. I’m writing and performing a new piece! It’s nerve-wracking the second time around, too, but fortunately I have an amazing editor and director to guide me. I am having a bit of a mid-life crisis about concentrating in design or energy, and I’m trying to learn more about both those spaces in industry. I’m trying to be more involved in clubs and to meet new people. I also have some PE requirements left, which feel a bit more pressing now that I am old. I successfully went to a Berklee house concert. It was a metal concert in a basement and had the youngest, cleanest, and most chaotic mosh pit I have seen. I found more geese I’m tryna prioritize having a life over throwing myself into classes. As happens every semester, however, I’m excited by all these classes and what I will learn from them. Let’s see how it goes.

 anew.  Google defines it as “in a new or different and typically more positive way,” which I think perfectly captures my return to MIT after taking leave this past fall. I’ve been thinking about the breakdown of it. The structure of the word entices you to wonder what’s next. It’s literally “a” and “new”. A new… what? You may be wondering why I decided to take the last semester off. There’s much to unpack, so I’ll save my leave for another blog and instead focus this one on my return.  I just came back, and everything feels lovely.  It feels as if

It’s so good! This joyful state is most provoked when I stroll through campus and observe things.  I love the danger signs that line the entirety of the labs in the tunnels.

While I’ve been away, the culture of our floor has flourished. There’s always someone in the lounge to hang out with. The group chat is so alive, yet not overbearing.

One-off and regular events happen left and right. It’s obvious that people want to spend quality, fun time together. I could gush on, but instead, I’ll give you one line that captures my love of Beast: every night, I look forward to coming home.  My  friends  generally seem more settled into college life, as people tend to be after their first year. It’s refreshing. Some have figured out more about what they want to study or do after graduation, at least for right now. Some have found cozy times in their days to cook healthy meals or go on runs. Some feel less like imposters and more like comrades. It’s lovely to watch people grow, as I also have from afar while at home. I finished building my loft! In the fall, during the week before school began, I very quickly constructed a loft for  my room  with the help of my neighbor. Though, something funny happened in the time between the fall and spring semesters: my twin mattress mysteriously disappeared. Luckily, I happened to have a spare queen-sized bed that I was using as a

 ⁠ 08 work as a teaching assistant for the class Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism Teaching a subject after having learned it makes the content feel new and big. I feel like I have fresh eyes and can understand the topics more wholly. There’s much I enjoy about this role: practicing explaining complicated stuff in simple ways, learning to listen to what specific things people are confused about, and so on. But, the particular thing that makes me love TAing is seeing people light up from understanding new concepts. There are a few thoughts that have been recently playing on repeat in my internal brain jukebox, and one of them relates to 8.02. I’m about to change your life.   Okay. Have you ever thought about how waves are LITERALLY all around you? Like, there are a gazillion waves (sound waves, light waves, radio waves, microwaves, etc.) pulsating through you at every waking (and sleeping!) moment. In fact, Wi-Fi signals (radio waves) probably have transmitted this blog to whatever device you’re reading on right now. Sometimes, I just sit in my room and look around at my technology wondering “could I build this from scratch?” Like, who would think that if you put this metal with this wire you could send waves across the entire world? The overwhelming bulk of recent human innovation has been founded on seemingly-invisible waves that we’ve learned to detect, create, and bend to our will. They permeate through
 
everything, everywhere, all at once. ⁠ 09 i love this movie so much 💞 And, of course,  blogging  is one of the things I’m most excited about this semester. I was actually supposed to start blogging this past fall but had taken my leave and subsequently decided to postpone. I absolutely was not in the state to blog. There are a lot of different cues I know about myself that indicate a bad state, and one of them is a lack of creativity. I had no blog ideas. I couldn’t seem to put words on the page. I hated writing. But, thankfully, that season of life has passed. Nine years ago, in 2014, I first heard about this little place called MIT. After my friend’s dad mentioned that it was a decent school, I looked it up and immediately found myself reading the blogs. I devoured them, binge-reading during empty pockets of the day. I so loved how open, silly, and sweet everyone was. It felt real. I basically knew nothing about college by this point and exclusively visited  the blog tab of the school website, not even bothering to look at other tabs until weeks later. I remember trying to find blogs from other schools as well, but they were largely sparse and empty. It made MIT feel like that much more of a special place. The school really cares about the student, for the most part: centering their voices, providing freedom of expression, and letting the world see for itself what it’s really like on campus. I love it here, and I hope that my stories make you at least   falling in love with it too. #8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism #A Blog About Blogging #East Campus #friends #leave of absence #lofts #Makerspaces #yay for first post!!!

This weekend, some people from MIT SAAS went to Yale for the South Asian Youth Initiative conference. The purpose of this conference is to create community for South Asians and provide a space to talk about activism, dialogue and solidarity. Throughout the weekend, I tried to keep track of everything that was happening and I will try to recreate most of that here! Friday 2/10/23  1:45 pm –  Bhuvna M. ’23, Neil M. ’25, Sarah S. ’24 and I meet in front of McCormick to head to South Station to catch our bus to New Haven. It is very sunny and warm; naturally, everyone is in a very good mood.  2:15 pm  – At South Station, we are looking around to figure out what station our flixbus leaves from. Realizing our confusion, someone walking by tells us the gate number and asks if we are going to Yale. It is one of the people from Harvard who are also going to SAYI. We walk over to the gate and are already excited at the prospect of meeting all the desi people we will at this conference.  2:30 pm –  The bus leaves from South Station. We find an empty row and take the four seats. For a while, we talk about different things: classes, extracurriculars, how excited we are for the weekend. We also meet someone from Wellesley here. At some point, Neil and I both fall asleep. Sarah and Bhuvna are still talking. I wake up with the worst neck ache ever but it eventually goes away.  5:25 pm –  Welcome to New Haven! It is more windy and cold than the sunny, deceptively warm Boston day we left behind. We part from the rest of the people and call an Uber to get to our Airbnb. The Airbnb is really beautiful. It is a cute 2 storey house with 4 bedrooms and a small lounge area and kitchen. We excitedly go around the entire place and express great excitement over the light in the bathroom mirror. look at us and our fancy bathroom mirrors 6:13 pm –  We walk to St. Thomas More Chapel to get ourselves registered. The excitement has not worn out. New Haven is a beautiful college town and we are all for it. Neil points at signs that fascinate him as we look around to find places to eat dinner. Previous Next 6:26 pm –  We register and get Shan Masala merch (arguably the most important part of the weekend). They are one of the sponsors so they have goody bags with some of their masalas and custard!  At the same time, after failing to reserve at the Indian restaurant nearby, we decide to go to a Thai place.  6:45 pm –  We are waiting for our food in Basil Restaurant. I ordered the Indonesian Mee Goreng noodles and a peach boba.  The place is really good. The food and portions are great and the person helping us is extremely nice. The peach boba is almost like a slush. It’s different but I love it.  We decide to go to the Barnes & Noble we saw on our way. We look around for a while, Sarah and Bhuvna get Yale merch and we head back to the Airbnb. Previous Next 8:20 pm – cute iron After getting to the Airbnb, we all work until 9:30 and then I start ironing my clothes for the Banquet tomorrow with Sarah’s cute little iron. It is really small so it takes me a long time to get them in a reasonable shape. Sarah teaches Bhuvna some dance moves as Neil works on his
 
6.031 ⁠ 01 6.102: Software Construction Around the same time, we put on a movie on the TV. The movie is not great but the commentary is, so we are all having fun!  10:37 pm –   We order Taco Bell and boba from T-swirl Crepe. Some insightful commentary along the way from Bhuvna and Sarah:  ‘Men are temporary. Money is for life.’ ‘ I hate 
Asha. ⁠ 02 the main character Why does she have to suck?’ 11:52 pm –  We’re watching Indian Matchmaking. One of the people invited to the conference is Sima Taparia from this show and since I have not watched it before, I must catch up before I meet her. We put up an episode from the second season and immerse ourselves in this incredible piece of media. 12:30 am –  Everyone gets ready to go to bed. 1:28 am –  So much has happened in the past couple of days that even though I am tired and desperately want to go to bed, my brain is a jumble of thoughts. It feels like a stereo is playing; on one channel, I can hear ‘Hey yo, Westerburg’; on others, I am thinking about literature and the books I need to get for my class, general existential thoughts, my
 
8.04 ⁠ 03 Quantum Physics I At one point, I become aware that I’ll write this in the blog and then start thinking about the different ways people imagine and how it is visual for some people and not for others. At this point, I am scared I’ll forget all of this in the morning so I pull out my phone. I check my discord and for some reason, Matthew H. ’25 thinks it’s okay to send me math at 1 am.
 
Inconceivable. ⁠ 04 Yes, that is a Princess Bride reference. What can I say, I'm a sucker for happy endings. Yes, that is a Heathers reference. Saturday 2/11/23  8:16 am –  I wake up and start to get ready for our panels in the morning.  9:26 am –  We leave for breakfast. Ananya G. ’23, Deekshita K. ’22 and Mitali C. ’24 just got here so we are trying to find them before we leave. They miss the street and we can’t figure out the lockbox so after a little bit of confusion, Neil just sprints down the street to find them. The rest of us choose food over Neil and leave for breakfast. He lets them into the Airbnb and catches up with us.  9:50 am –  After walking around the entire building trying to find the correct entrance to the Science Building, we find that the closest entrance to us was actually the correct one. We get bagels for breakfast, which was a good throwback to when I was here during the fall for quizbowl and had the exact same bagels. We head in for the Opening Keynote with Sal Khan, who is expected to join virtually. As the moderator introduces him and says that he went to MIT, we all cheer and everyone is looking at us. It is pretty funny.  Previous Next Here, we also meet Maisha P., who graduated from MIT in 2021 and is now at Yale for graduate school! Sal Khan has some emergency so he is unable to make it and we start heading out to our first panels.  11:44 am –  I am at the first panel for Mental Health and Queer Identity with Neil, Deekshita, Ananya and Mitali. The panelists are all very cool and doing great work in their respective fields.  We talked about how intergenerational trauma, immigrant and refugee experiences and language barrier are key reasons for the stigma surrounding mental health in South Asian communities. The fact that there are no clinical words for depression in Urdu and Hindi is frankly, very scary. People fail to communicate what they are really struggling with because they don’t know how to accurately translate their feelings in a way where the medical professionals, who have not been trained or seen similar struggles, understand them effectively. First gen people often struggle with cultural conflict. Inside your home, you are ‘very desi’ and ‘very white’ outside which means you are essentially living two lives. This can be very confusing for people who are trying to understand their identity.  There was conversation on how a lot of South Asian communities had, although not perfect, a more open understanding of sexual orientation and gender, which were taken away during the British colonialism era and the Victorian ideals of what gender and sexuality need to look like.  12:53 pm –  Mitali and I walk over to Costa Pizza to meet Sarah, Bhuvna and Shreya R. ’24 (who just got here) for lunch. We talk about our thoughts on the panel and have a great conversation as we get there. We talk about our respective panels and have a quick lunch before heading out to Battell Chapel for ‘Up Close with Sima Taparia.’ There is a moderator asking panel questions from her and also asking some audience questions that they had collected beforehand through a Google form.  2:10 pm –  We meet some people from Brown and hang out with them for a little while before heading for our next sessions. Bhuvna, Sarah and I head to Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall for the Arts and Entertainment panel. At one point, Sima Aunti walks down and Bhuvna just yells “HellOOO” and we all cheer again. All the panelists are really talented. The creative director and co-founder of

After one of the organizers speaks for a little bit, there is a fashion show. While the rest of the people are sitting down, all of us MIT folks are standing and dancing and cheering loudly. After the fashion show, Gurbir Grewal and Archana Jain gave keynote speeches and later dinner was served.  8:00 pm –  After dinner, people start dancing to the music playing. At first, we are just dancing at our table but later form a circle near the cluster of other people dancing. We keep planning on leaving but every new song breaks our resolve.  8:51 pm –  After we get back, people share their thoughts on some of the panels during the day. We watch a movie review for some really bad movie and leave for Chai after Dark.  10:37 pm –  To our extreme disappointment, there is no chai at Chai after Dark. We debate leaving to get coffee, then come back and after a lot of indecisiveness, we decide to stay. We watch the performances put up by Yale’s Bhangra team and individual performances and leave. 11:30 pm –  Deekshita, being the queen she is, offers to put henna and I look through designs. She and Ananya brought a lot of nail polishes and other nail art supplies ,  so people are just hanging around, talking and doing nail art. During this time, there are a lot of good conversations and interesting stories going around. We are here for a while. owo 4:00 am  – A bunch of people leave to go to bed but six of us are still here. We play hot seat, which essentially meant going around asking people questions for 2 minutes. except there was an actual hot seat. except not really. it’s a cushion on the floor.  5:00 am  – We have finally retired for the day. Sunday 2/12/23 9:20 am  – Given how early (yep) we went to bed, I woke up around 9:20 and others are also waking up and getting ready around this time. We check out of our Airbnb and walk over to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe nearby for breakfast. 10:44 am –  We eat breakfast with all of our stuff just in the cafe. I got a Sunrise Sunset smoothie and a quesadilla. The only notable thing here is that they were playing Lavender Haze and then Anti Hero (no, I’m not obsessed with Taylor Swift). After breakfast, we split up to go to our panels on Caste, Colorism and Gender Violence, and Supremacy Politics.  12:30 pm –  I had planned to have lunch with Zayyan N. ’25, one of my friends from Pakistan who goes to Yale so we meet up after the panel. I wanted to try their dining halls so we go to one for lunch. We catch up on classes, extracurriculars and general semester things. He is taking a bunch of computer science classes and Chinese and is also

It has a lot of technology-free areas, study spots where people are working, spaces to nap but most importantly, as a sign points out, ‘Hydration Stations,’ which, to me, is a really funny way to describe water fountains. We walk over to Silliman, the dorm that he lives in, and wander around the basement, where the game room and
 
buttery ⁠ 12 dorms at Yale have late night eateries run by students . 2 pm  – I walk back to meet up with the rest of SAAS again. Unfortunately, my phone dies on the way and I am so smart, I walk right past the building I was supposed to go to but thankfully, there is a kind Yale student who helps me find it. People ordered food and are eating lunch in one of the rooms. We are to leave for Union Station in about an hour.  3:28 pm  – We are at Union Station. We run into the Harvard people again!  union station 3:54 pm  – We are on the train back. The group got slightly separated but I am sitting close enough to Sarah, Neil and Mitali that we can occasionally talk. I start working on this blogpost and send the document where I am drafting this into our group chat. 4:34 pm  – After asking Sarah, Neil asks me, ‘Who’s Candace?’ very cool. 6:18 pm  – We have arrived at South Station. We take the Red Line back to campus and guess who we see on the train. The Harvard people again! meant to be 🤩 ~7 pm  – I am back at Next House! My goals for the conference were to find a place to begin to think about identity, spend the weekend with a lot of desi people and get to know people on SAAS board with me better and I think I got all of that! There were a lot of diverse desi people, I got to spend a lot of time with all the cool SAAS board people (my queens (gender neutral)) and found a lot of conversations, at the very least, thought provoking.  There is a lot to do, a lot to think about and a lot to decide but seeing all the successful panelists living happy, fulfilling lives managing their different identities in a beautiful way, convinced me that I could be happy too. There is a future where I could be thriving in my community, where I am accepted for whoever I choose to be and where I don’t need to convince anyone of the authenticity of my identities. :pleading face: :pleading face: #mitsaas #saas #sayi #the hottest brown people on campus

Last week, one of my friends, “Mike”, asked me if I had any Valentine’s Day plans. I didn’t, so he asked me if I wanted to go out to a nice restaurant that day. I wasn’t opposed to the restaurant, although it was somewhat expensive. But I wasn’t sure what his intentions were: was this a platonic,  situation, or was he hoping for something more? While Mike was a nice dude, I wasn’t interested in getting involved in anything romantic with anybody at the moment. My friends unanimously voted that this was a romantic scenario. “It’s Valentine’s Day, and that restaurant has three dollar signs,” one of them said. She had a good point. I considered texting Mike, “Yes, let’s do it! I’ll invite our mutual friend Bob too” or showing up while leaning  into the plausible deniability of “I thought this was just a friend hangout!” But that was just delaying the inevitable conversation where he’d make his interest clear and I would have to turn him down. And didn’t I owe Mike the courtesy of straightforwardness? Wouldn’t it be better if he had a chance to spend Valentine’s Day with somebody on the same wavelength? “Let’s meet up in person and talk about it,” I messaged him. The next day, we walked along the Charles River, winter sunshine warm atop our heads, as I monologued.  It sounded so cliché, but it was all true. Mike nodded. “Cool, I got you.” The entire conversation only lasted the length of the walk from Hayden Library to the intersection between Massachusetts Avenue and dorm row—maybe five minutes. The following morning, our dynamic was exactly the same as before: we joked around in the Banana Lounge, we struggled through a problem set, we sat next to each other in lecture. Any awkwardness I’d feared had easily dissipated into the February chill. Today is the first February 14th in years that I haven’t spent with someone in a romantic context. I was in class until 1:30 pm, then I hit the gym, and after dinner I baked chocolate desserts with friends from WILG (my living group). baked with lani l. ’21 & elisabeth b. ’22 I don’t know if there’s a way to say  without sounding like cope, especially on Valentine’s Day, but  . I haven’t truly been single in years. I became accustomed to all the broad strokes of a relationship—being attuned to someone else’s needs, adjusting to their quirks and habits, creating a shared language of inside jokes and collective memories. I cherish the trust and safety cultivated within these relationships. So much of life feels like estrangement—there’s always this untranslatable distance between people, and isn’t that quite lonely? But I also adore a wide-open schedule, getting to watch whatever I want on Hulu ( , anyone?), and focusing on my own career and friends. This past month, I spent hours coding a house management website for WILG, and it occurred to me that this almost certainly wouldn’t have happened if I weren’t single. Maybe some of you are fantastic at compartmentalization, but I’m not, and I don’t think I would’ve gathered the time or focus to build something new while also pouring energy into somebody else. In the last week of January, I visited my younger brother in Los Angeles, and our parents flew down from Oregon. During the trip, my mom and I spoke about having kids, since I’m not sure when I should start a family. (It is so unfair that women are expected to choose between career and children, but that’s for a different post …) “Once you’re a mother, you’re  a mother, and you’ll always be tethered to somebody whose needs you place above your own,” she said. “Why rush into that? You’re so young. You haven’t even graduated from college yet.” Being in a serious romantic relationship and raising kids aren’t the same, of course, but the principle remains. I’m still young, and there’s so much I want to do for myself. I want to say  to social invites without fretting about how my partner might feel about it, and I want to spend my evenings reading or studying or anything else I might like. Hell, I refuse to even adopt a cat, even though I absolutely adore them, and several other girls in WILG have cats, because I don’t want any disruption to my personal space or sleep schedule, or to anchor myself to a years-long commitment. I suppose all this is to say—being single is unexpectedly kind of awesome. Maybe this arises from luck of circumstance, as I’m comfortable with myself and the obstacles in my life are not so insurmountable that I can’t defeat them alone. I’m not dunking on people who aren’t single, or who are actively searching for a partner. And I’m not dissing my exes, as they are really cool people. But maybe solitude is underrated.

There is currently a painting staring at me.  It’s perched on top of my bookshelf, at the perfect vantage point to scornfully watch me. It’s a green house, inspired by the one across the street from my parent’s house. I underpainted it pink. It looks  bad,  and I don’t have the time to fix it. Its color palette is incohesive, the perspective is off, the value contrast is nonexistent. A couple more layers of paint could make it beautiful, but I know I probably won’t be finishing it anytime soon. As much as leaving a painting like that is physically painful, there’s a knot of guilt, pushing down the desire to grab my paint brushes, because I know I probably ought to spend the time doing the supplemental reading for 6.046. I put it on the top shelf to avoid the oil paint rubbing off everywhere; I wonder if, on some level, I also wanted to shame myself for producing ‘bad’ work, and leaving it as such. As you might’ve assumed, I’ve been thinking a lot recently about making art.  Painting used to be an integral part of my life. I didn’t own many pairs of jeans that weren’t splattered with color. My mom would to unfailingly chide me when I’d graffiti my own arms on the daily. My first kindergarten show-and-tell was a painting of a sunset, which I recall blending and re-blending until I fell asleep at my desk.  I still love painting, but my relationship with art is changing. I’m a messy painter, or at least… I used to be. The last time I painted I walked away spotless. A bittersweet feeling settled on my tongue yesterday afternoon, as I thumbed a hole in the last of my familiar, paint-stained pants and finally accepted that I needed to let them go.  The time to make art is now a luxury. I recently told someone that I ‘paint a lot’, and realized with a start that this simply isn’t true – not anymore. I made 5 large oil paintings over the summer, and have finished almost nothing during my sophomore year. The bottom drawer of my desk is filled with paint. Quinacridone Magenta, Viridian Green, Cerulean. I see the tubes and I  want  to do something with them, but I can’t. It now feels less like art (of any kind) is omnipresent and more as if it’s a side-job, momentary dawdling as I get sidetracked from my larger (academic) goals. Somewhat unfortunately, making art requires lengthy, contiguous blocks of time. Almost all of my blog posts are written in one sitting, often 4-5 consecutive hours of thinking, writing, typing, and editing. There’s some sensation akin to anxiety there, as well. I keep painting not really because I have an explicit desire to spend 8 hours staring at a photo of plums, but because it feels natural. It is an activity you start and continue until you’re done. There’s inertia. Somehow, if I go too long without painting, or writing, or anything else, I start feeling antsy, as if the walls are closing in on me. Internally, my creation is often propelled by a feeling of claustrophobia, a sense that if I don’t make  something  I can’t go on. Art is a treasure I keep in my back pocket, something fun to think about, even if I don’t always have the time to invest in it. I like teaching people about color theory, about the internal rhythm to paint. There are warm and cool blues, reds, and yellows, and one can use this fact to mix any color they want to. I have nuggets of wisdom, lore about painting. Coffee makes good calligraphy ink, and dries shiny. You’re supposed to wait a few weeks before varnishing an oil painting. One of my favorite thought experiments is to mentally envision how I would paint everything currently in my line of sight. Art has brought me joy in unexpected and serendipitous ways. Even its frustrations are so satisfying. Painting is an exercise in self-discipline. Your sketch is always attractive; you mentally fill in all the unfinished parts with their ideal realization, which you quickly discover is entirely beyond your skill set. It looks horrible for a couple of hours. More than a couple, actually. It generally looks atrocious until you’re almost done, at which point you’re so feverishly chasing the painting’s completion that it’s hard to appreciate any progress. You feel the entire time as if you’ve become sick of the painting, and are simply waiting to finally throw it across the room, and potentially into the trash can. But there’s a moment, after you’ve paid sufficient penance (in time and tears), that you understand. You see the fruition of your efforts and achieve the sweetness of completion. Incredibly, despite all of this – my internal reliance on making art, my delight at its existence, my enjoyment of the artistic process – too long without a brush in my hand had made me forget how to be feel happy with my work. Too much thought had gone into it; how long would I need? Was I good enough to pull off the effect I wanted? Would I actually want the piece when it was finished? I created a ball of frustration, culminating in a very sad, slightly pink (but mostly green) house. I needed to stop intellectualizing. So, to force myself out of it, I did a simple exercise; I sat down with a piece of paper and a pencil, pulled up a few reference images, and started. 5 minutes per face, 5 faces. At the end of half an hour, I was happy. For the first time in months, I had finally achieved the soft internal glow of a ‘successful’ drawing.  the heads I drew! They’re not perfect, but the wonderful part was that they didn’t have to be. They look like people, and they’re all charming, in their own ways. The likeness is dubious on a few, but it doesn’t matter. I set my pencil down and I was happy with my work. Imperfect, but still worthwhile. I felt like an artist.

two weeks ago i was walking through the infinite corridor at night and i thought about how absurd it was that i was even allowed to be there at that hour. when you’re a kid and it’s nighttime you’re basically only allowed to be at home or at friends’ places or in public spaces like open stores and the outdoors; this is mostly true for adults as well, except i suppose they’re also allowed to be in the office. but when you’re a college student, for a brief time you can basically do whatever you want on campus at any time, and i did not realize how unusual this was until recently all of which begs the question: how do people who graduate deal with no longer having all this at their fingertips? how do people transition from being at one of the greatest intellectual hubs on the planet to returning to the rest of the world, or from the freedom of being a college student to the structure of regular adult life? one answer is to avoid leaving school, to stay in the world of academia with masters degrees and phds and professorships. that’s not a path i’m considering right now, mostly because i don’t feel like i have enough technical ability or conviction to pull it off, but maybe i’ll come back to it in a few years another possible answer is to leave school but to not move on. my friend once told me that the reason some new grads party so much is because they’re trying to pretend they’re still in school. a lot of people have told me  “college is the best four years of your life”  and i think that’s an extremely dangerous mentality to have because it encourages you to become fixated on the past, but it seems to be commonly held anyway there are probably plenty of other answers out there. for example, if you asked me three years ago i would’ve said something like  adult life sucks and you should just accept that without thinking too hard about whatever else you’ve experienced . that’s not a view i resonate with anymore, but for a while it was something i really believed in i’ve seen many attempts at community-building over the last few years. i’ve lived in some coliving houses that felt like paradise, and other coliving houses that just felt like a bunch of people using the same space. i’ve seen a lot of clubs at mit successfully adjust to covid, and also started my own club for making viral educational content which completely failed (though i’ll be starting another club similar in spirit soon!) most recently, some of my friends who live near mit (they aren’t students) have been hosting weekly gatherings where we catch up and eat food and usually end up talking about brains or physics or something like that. it’s consistently one of the highlights of my week, and one time i remember thinking  if this was what my life next year was like – being able to nerd out with genuine, wholesome people on a regular basis –  i wouldn’t feel as bad about leaving mit.  of course there’s still a lot about this place i would miss, but at least that loss would feel bearable; i wouldn’t feel nearly as lost or ungrounded as i would otherwise in one of my  favorite episodes  of  the anthropocene reviewed , john green discusses a commencement address vonnegut gave:  “What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.” when i first listened to this episode around two years ago, i didn’t understand why vonnegut thought community-building was a daring endeavor. it’s hard to really appreciate what he means here until you experience for yourself how bad the terrible disease of loneliness is and how hard community-building is and how transformative it can be when done well. i definitely didn’t understand these things at the time, though now i do so this is my answer now: you don’t get over no longer being in a place like mit by running away from the problem or by pretending you haven’t left or by giving up altogether; you do it by creating new communities that you love, to fill the holes left by the ones you can no longer be a part of “When people ask me why I live in Indianapolis when I could live anywhere, that’s what I want to tell them. I am trying to create a stable community in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured, and you gotta do that somewhere. When I am sick with the disease of loneliness, good weather and shimmering skyscrapers do me no good whatsoever, as a writer or as a person. I must be home to do the work I need to do. And yes, home is that house where you no longer live. Home is before, and you live in after. But home is also what you are building and maintaining today, and I feel rather lucky in the end to be making my home [here]”

One of MIT’s oldest student groups is the  Assassins Guild And one of the Guild’s oldest traditions is the ten-day game, which is exactly what it sounds: a ten-day long larp. These happen in IAP, the glorious time of year when classes aren’t as big of a deal for most people. Such ten-days have been written about in the blogs before, like  in 2008 in 2009 Paul B. ’11 This year’s ten-day game was Harry Potter Year 7: Hogwarts Under Siege, co-written by Andrew M. ’97, Ariel S. ’04, E. Rosser ’12, and Krue ’14. This is a rerun of HP7; the last time it ran was in 2011. And it’s the first ten-day I joined: in 2020 no one ran one, and in 2021 and 2022 no ten-days ran due to the pandemic. So I was so hyped that a ten-day ran this year, and got as many of my friends to sign up as I could. The pandemic’s been rough for the Guild, so there were less players than I hoped. But the game still ran, and it was  . It was the highlight of my IAP this year, a spot of joy in an otherwise dark winter. As much as I want to, I don’t have the time or energy to write a huge post about this, but here’s some scattered thoughts. Almost all Guild games during the semester are one-nights, which take around four hours. Ten-days are a commitment, but it’s not like you’re in-game 24/7. On weekdays I usually entered game at around 7 or 8 PM and stayed until 1 or 2 AM, and on weekends I entered at around 3 or 4 PM and stayed until 2 or 3 AM. To be clear, I spent this much time on game because I was having fun! I spent time outside of game looking forward to coming back and doing things. I’d guess that I was also on the upper end in terms of time spent playing. Cramming a one-night in the middle of a semester can be hard, sometimes, due to scheduling and school. A ten-day game in IAP sounds like a lot, but I enjoyed every hour of it, and I wish I’d gotten a chance to do this earlier. Costuming and props are fun. I was reluctant to get robes at first, but some generous donations from alums allowed us to all get robes for free. I played as Neville Longbottom, so I have these gorgeous red-trimmed robes, that fly around when I walk quickly. it’s a me You can also see me holding a wand in this picture, which was made by Ariel S. ’04. I loved holding my wand while walking around the halls. It didn’t have a mechanical effect in the game; if I wanted to shoot people I’d use a Nerf gun, not point my wand at them. But it felt so cool to do the hand movements when casting spells, and it was a nice thing to fidget with while walking down hallways at 2 AM. The best thing about the robes is that I’ve kept them after game end. Wearing the robes while square dancing was great, because it does the spinny thing when I rotate my body, and it looks so cool. It’s mildly warm, so I’ve worn it outside when it isn’t too cold, when I don’t feel like putting on a jacket. Like many Guild games, HP7 has combat mechanics. Nerf guns for generic spells that did 1 HP each, maybe 2 HP if you had an ability that did extra damage. Then spell packets for other spells. A spell packet is this cloth sphere, maybe five centimeter diameter, filled with bird seed, held with a rubber band. You throw these spell packets and yell what effect they produce when they hit, like “flee”, “cower”, “crucio”, or “death”. As Neville, I was part of a group called Dumbledore’s Army, and one of our goals was collecting some items. Let’s call these  MacGuffins Anyway, one night, I, Michael Corner (Alex B. ’24), and Charlie Entwhistle (Spruce C. ’26), were breaking into the office of Professor Flitwick (Jesse A. ’11). We got in, saw two MacGuffins. Because they’re MacGuffins, they didn’t do anything on their own, and were mostly useless unless you knew what MacGuffins were and were also looking for them. I offered to split the loot between the three of us, you know, being all polite even if I wanted all of it. Then Charlie hit me with a flee packet. I ran away. The flee spell made me run until I reached another building or floor, so I kept running. But that moment, Charlie outed himself as a Death Eater to me,   Michael was a witness. Which, I dunno, I thought was pretty funny. A shadowrun is a challenge you beat to get into a location that’s otherwise guarded, covered in wards, locked, or inaccessible. As high school students living in a dangerous time, we were forbidden from leaving Hogwarts. So if you wanted to go to the Whomping Willow, you have to defeat these challenges: there are about twenty of these A person sorted into Slytherin could beat the   challenge. Someone who has the spell   ready could beat the   challenge. Someone who brings a pet snake can beat the   challenge. And some people might be inherently   or  , and able to beat that challenge. The thing about spells is that, even if you knew all of them, you couldn’t have all of them ready at the same time. Everyone has a spell hand of around 3 to 4, and you can’t switch spells during a shadowrun. Beating this Whomping Willow shadowrun alone is pretty much impossible; you need the help of others. This kind of shadowrun, where all the challenges are presented upfront, is the easier kinds of shadowrun. In the harder kind, there’s a certain area, where you have to find the challenges yourself. It starts off with this map: “blue” In the area highlighted, there’s small strips of paper taped in hidden places. And I’m talking small, like 1cm × 5cm. They could be below a sign, in the middle of a wall, behind a railing, blending in on top of a poster, wherever. The strip says something like “Challenge:  “, and you need to find and beat a certain number of these to do the shadowrun. tiny sign The Guild takes down its signs after every game, but because these shadowrun signs are small and hard to find, they can stay up for years. Like this one I found the other day; you can see the date’s from 2019. found in a basement I love shadowruns. I loved the feeling of breaking into something, of looking for these small pieces of paper, of saying “I know a spell that can beat that challenge!” Neville’s broken into all the professors’ offices, went into the Chamber of Secrets and back, explored random secret corridors. I love the tension of not knowing what’s behind the envelope after finishing a shadowrun. Is it something that’ll be useful? Maybe everything good’s already been taken by another group? Is someone in my group gonna hit me with a flee packet once we’re there? Neville was supposed to be good at combat. I started the game with 5 HP, which was on the high end of the HP stat distribution. I started with two combat spells, one that gave me extra HP and another that made my Nerf bullets do more damage. But CJ, the player, was not interested in combat. So I didn’t bring a Nerf gun around, even though there were some people who wanted to kill me. I remember doing a raid somewhere with a bunch of other students, up against Death Eaters. I didn’t come in ready to do battle. But I was a tank: I could take a lot of hits. I didn’t fire any shots, but I picked up used bullets and spell packets and helped people reload. Because someone’s gotta play the support role in the party, right? I like to think we won in part because of my help. This tension between player and character is discussed in length in Philip T. ’01 MS ’03’s thesis,  Tensions in Live-Action Roleplaying Game Design creative director for the Game Lab Related to shadowruns are dot hunts. In a dot hunt, you’re looking for these small brightly-colored sticker dots. Except the area is much larger, typically a group of buildings. As a hint, the GMs instead give you a picture of a nearby item. Neville did a dot hunt to look for Trevor, his pet toad. Here’s the first picture the GMs gave me: can you guess where it is It’s like doing the  MIT Picture Scavenger Hunt it was between two elevator doors The dot trail was five dots long. And at the end, Neville and Trevor were reunited! it’s a trevor Dots are also hard to clean up, so if you go around MIT, you might spot these colored dots in out-of-the-way places. I’ve also been informed that, in the past, Facilities has also used colored dot stickers, so maybe don’t just randomly take them down. While Guild games vary widely, many of them have a focus on mechanics over plot. When given a character’s goals, I’m less interested in   I have these goals, and more interested in   I can accomplish them. That doesn’t mean plot or roleplay don’t matter, however. It’s called live-action   for a reason, and I’ve had my share of beautiful roleplaying moments. One of my roleplay things was being in this will-they-won’t-they romance with Draco Malfoy (Jerry H. ’23). Literally night one of the game, Draco and I started doing the romance mechanics with each other, and utterly failing. Apparently all the flirts I knew wasn’t compatible with Draco’s tastes, and vice versa. Oops. Thankfully, Lavender Brown (Bianca H. ’24) did everything in her power to set me and Draco up, teaching us flirts she knew the other would like. arent we cute Now, there’s no mechanical reason for Neville and Draco to romance each other. It’s not one of my character goals or anything. I mean, it’s a little good for mood, but I didn’t care about that stat too much. But we did it anyway. I think Jerry and I made eye contact during packet handout, realized we had characters that would make for a cute ship, and we, as players, thought it’d be fun to do it. So we did, because who cares about canon? Anyway it culminated it me dancing with Draco in the Yule Ball, as everyone cheered wildly for us. dancing 100 The Guild owes much to its alumni. We have a long oral tradition, stories passed down from decades before, over post-game dinners at restaurants around the area. Cruft come and write games for current students, because cruft generally have more free time to write games. Donations and membership fees from alums cover some of the Guild’s costs. In one sense it gives me joy, thinking about how I’ll be an alum in the future, that I can come back and continue to be a member of the Guild. In another sense it terrifies me, because with each year, there’ve been changes that make it harder for alums to stay involved. For example, over my undergrad, it’s become harder to arrange access to the Guild office, or to game spaces, or to our archives on Athena. Then again, maybe I’m worrying too much. Some random quotes and pictures that I don’t have time to write about. Eliza Nicklebury (Jen C. ’23): “If someone searches me, they just get the library.” Vincent Crabbe (Bella X. ’25), to Neville: “Your bottom has grown too long!” Pierre Moreau (Shashvat S. ’23): “We are Dumbledore’s secret weapon! The students who survived his teaching!” Hannah “Cruciatus” Abbott (Izzy R. ’24): “Professor McGonagall, what should students do if they feel unsafe in their own common room?” 
Millicent Bulstrode (Julia W. RPI ’20 G): “Then one should kindly ask Hannah Abbott to leave that common room!” Angelina Norman (Spencer L. SM ’16): “Alright then, I’ll go ask Gryffindor, they’re actually brave, you cowards!” 
Anthony Goldstein (Richard F. UMass PhD ’20): “You aren’t wrong.” Daphne Greengrass (Diana S. ’25): “Being a journalist is so much more fun when 3/4 of your articles are shameless lies and the other is self promotion.” drawing by Molly Pickville (Skylar L. ’23) Mary Goodspeare (Giniya A. ’24) and Claude Selwyn (Silk Y. ’25) over Headmaster Snape’s unconscious body a “mildly breakable vow” here drawings by Samuel Clarenlocke (Via T. ’26)

In order to do that, we conducted qualitative research with students, faculty, and staff, including human-centered design workshops run by (my friend and grad school labmate)  Dr. Alexis Hope Lifelong Kindergarten Here were some of those identity principles: Extending the story: surface community stories, share more voices, broaden the reach of MIT and its relationship to the world  Connect to the rest of campus :  features that thematically ‘extend’ the central artery of the Infinite and include other Institute touchstones   Analog, organic, human : eclectic, authentic features that live, grow, breathe Reliable, resilient, layered : features that work  without  ‘tech’ but become more interesting, compelling, unique when augmented  with  ‘tech’  Participatory, dynamic, open :  interactive features that allow the MIT, Cambridge, and broader community to co-create the Center Evolves over time:  One of the things we learned in that research was that, while MIT has school colors, they are rarely deployed in our most visible branding, which instead relies on

Have you ever wondered how different college mascots are evolutionarily related to each other? Of course not. If you said yes, then you’re lying. I’m the only person ever who’s asked this question, and I’m pretty sure that I can claim the title of being the founder of mascot phylogenetics. Put that down on my Wikipedia page  
if I ever become famous. ⁠ 01 jk please don't (click for better visibility) I got the inspiration for this from one of my favorite YouTubers and writers Jon Bois, where he ranked every NCAA FBS college football mascot by their weight. At first, I was just going to copy Jon’s idea and make something similar with Boston-area college mascots. I was going to make a weight chart at first, and then I changed my mind to a height chart. imagine something like this, but with college mascots (image credit: Fred Wierum) As it turns out, relying on measurements was going to be finicky when I only have Google to get my source material from. Different mascots were going to have varying levels of accuracy based on the data available about their physical measurements. I decided a phylogenetic tree was going to be a better approach, given these limitations.  – A diagram that shows the evolutionary relationships between different species. These are based on our current understanding and knowledge of biodiversity, so these trees are essentially just   and not hard facts.

Depending on how specific the school is about their mascot, I either got a specific classification all the way down to the species, or I had to use a more general classification with something like genus or family, for example. (click for better visibility) Lasell University and the University of Massachusetts at Boston won’t be connected to the tree because they unfortunately lack any formal taxonomic classification.

It’s 6:30am. The natural lighting floods in past the courtyard, filling every square inch of this (albeit slightly smaller than the previous one) room. The camera  once again I’ve started waking up way too early ever since I got back from my trip home for winter break. It’s making me a mildly functioning adult before 9am– a feat I once thought impossible. So now, I get to start of my days writing in bed as opposed to immediately running to class (from the farthest possible dorm to run to campus from). Waking up this early was a change. One I didn’t intend on, but a change nonetheless. I am left thinking about how much has truly changed over the course of winter break. I am left thinking:  A short montage of packing a backpack, taking meds, throwing on shoes, and putting on eyeliner plays. I grab my bag, and leave the room. With the closing of the door, the camera cuts away to a peaceful Next House Dining breakfast. Change that happens slowly– like becoming older or the changing of the seasons–   I’m okay with. I can anticipate it. But sometimes, a change is so quick you can’t even process what’s happening. Flashback to less than 24 hours ago when I was moving cartload after cartload from 2East (a wing of Next House) to 3West (another wing of Next House). Less than 6 months ago, I thought I’d stay in my old room until the day I died (or, y’know, graduated). But the more I hung out with my friends on 2East, the more it dawned on me that they won’t be here next year. We were talking about grad school applications and job offers. I began to realize that next year, I’d be alone. And as selfish as it was, I began to realize that I needed to change this. The realization itself– the realization that I wanted/needed to switch wings– was slow. But the implementation, was immediate. I had my room packed and moved over in less than four hours. Bam: a smash cut to me walking to my first class of the day: 18.966: Geometry of Manifolds II. Why does every life changing moment feel like it happens over the course of hours if not minutes? Graduating high school, getting into MIT, moving to campus, etc. I haven’t gotten used to how quickly life can change, even if the anticipation for the change has been building for months or years. I knew months ago that my  mental health . But I still feel  about the changes I’ve been making to do so. I’ve been waking up earlier because I like taking my time to get out of bed. I’ve moved floors so I stop worrying about being alone next year. I’ve been making changes, ones that are supposed to be good,  but can’t stop feeling like I’m doing something wrong, because I find myself saying No to people to make these changes. Yet another montage of math classrooms and coffee drinking later, and we cut to me walking back home. MIT has been teaching me how to say No. No to commitments, No to living on 2East, No to working on that problemset right now because if I see any more math right now my eyes are going to start to burn. It’s selfish (at least it feels that way), but it’s important.  I   do everything. I   stay in 2East. I   to do what’s best for me. It’s a change. And I hate it. 
I hope one day I won’t hate it so much. A Glee-esque outro theme plays. #changes

(the lighting was way better from this side) one of the hazards of constantly   is that it’s often hard to put aside time for small things, like art or writing, if they haven’t already been ingrained as habit. it feels very tempting to put off tasks like these which require creativity or synthesis, basically everything featured on this blog. which is also to say, I’d like to write more now that I’m transitioning from college to the next phase of my life. I’m excited to say that I’ll   be pursuing a Ph.D. in quantum information next year! probably because I haven’t committed to a program yet, not that I’m unsure about the Ph.D. I don’t know where I’ll be next year, but I like to think that’s part of the fun. I’m only a little embarrassed to admit that I used to feverishly consume advice and self-help content, whether in the form of long-form blogs by wise and accomplished seniors, or anonymous forum posts from fellow students. these days, I think that online advice is often useful as a starting point, but it also lacks the context and nuance you might get from someone who actually knows you. for the same reasons, I’m also more cautious now about giving advice to other people. so as a disclaimer, I don’t intend this post as advice for younger students, but I do want to put out some of my thoughts about my time in college and what I’ll do after for my own reflections and in case they help start some conversations. specifically: I want to keep this post (relatively) short because again, it’s mostly not advice. if you find yourself in a similar situation as I was, or if what I’ve written resonates with you, feel free to reach out! there are also so many other online resources like the  mit admissions blog I was incredibly lucky to attend a high school with amazing STEM (and non-STEM) classes and teachers. I read a lot of popular science articles, and I also read a lot of textbooks (shoutout to the secondhand copy of campbell biology 6th ed. which was featured in my common app!). but the main reason I decided to study physics was that it gave me intuition for the equations that I had already learned to solve in math class. when I got to college, I was initially unsure if I would double major, or what I would double in—mit only assigns majors at the end of the first year, and does not allow double major applications until the second semester of sophomore year. at the time, computer science seemed like the more practical choice, since I hadn’t decided on grad school (more on that later). however, the first semester at mit is taken on pass/no record, and a friend convinced me to take abstract algebra. in hindsight I think this was one of the most important decisions I made in my freshman year, because it completely changed my mind about higher level math. I had come in with some exposure to math olympiads, but was convinced that clever problem-solving techniques in pure math weren’t my strong suit. but algebra, and as it turns out a lot of higher level math, is   like this and mostly about taking abstract definitions which are inspired by familiar objects, and using standard mathematical frameworks to prove universal fundamental properties. not knowing that I would have to memorize definitions for a math class, I came completely unprepared for the first of three quizzes and was devastated to receive a 50. by the end, however, I figured it out and received a 100 on the last quiz. later, I also realized that I was really interested in the mathy parts of physics, and it made sense to add a math major, which only requires eight non-introductory classes. (a note here is that mit doesn’t restrict enrollment for most technical classes, so you can take most classes even if you’re not majoring in the subject.) I knew I liked physics even before I got to college, but pursuing a Ph.D. was a whole other issue. I grew up in an immigrant household, and while both my parents had attended college, they no longer worked in the same field as the degree they had received. I had always internalized the expectation that I would graduate from college with employable credentials and get a job. to be very clear,   nearly half the physics majors in my department each year go into industry right out of undergrad. similarly, there are potential exit strategies at every stage in academia. but that was very difficult to grasp as a high schooler, without knowing any family friends who were academics and only seeing the average salary of a grad student. I had two experiences that really changed my mind. first, I’ve mentioned before on this blog that I had a “winternship” in new york in january 2020. I landed this from the mit externship program, which places students with programs run by mit alums. my project was on analyzing transaction data using machine learning techniques, but I think my supervisor gave me an offer because he had a Ph.D. in physics and was impressed by some projects on my resume. the project didn’t work as well as we hoped, but its real benefit was being able to interact with other people working in finance who had gotten a Ph.D. and then left academia. both of the younger people in my group wholeheartedly recommended doing a Ph.D. if I was interested in it and affirmed the abundance of exit strategies. second, in summer 2021 I worked at the Caltech Institute of Quantum Information and Matter through the SURF program. while this wasn’t my first research experience, it was the first where I felt I had accomplished something nontrivial, and it felt like exactly what I wanted to do as a job. my project was essentially on local scrambling in random quantum circuits as a model for thermalization in condensed matter systems, which meant I got to do a lot of analysis but also learn about real physics. also, pasadena is lovely and there are succulents growing out of the ground! a common thread here is that mentorship has been really important for me, mainly because I didn’t expect to and didn’t always feel secure enough to take this route, and I’m lucky to have stumbled upon pretty good mentors who convinced me otherwise without thinking too much about it. having gone through most of it ( see halfway post . that includes my work and career, which to me are very fulfilling, but it also includes my social circles and day-to-day life outside of work. while I’m a bit disappointed that very few of my grad school options are near new york or the bay area, where most of my friends will be, I feel grateful for the people in my life throughout college. I’m also glad that I had the chance to live off-campus, which is standard at some schools but not at mit, which comes with a totally new set of lessons about managing your time, nutrition, cleanliness of environment, etc. in addition to that, I spent a decent amount of time on teaching and outreach work, which I hope to continue in some extent throughout my life. as a result, I don’t think I’ve worked “as hard” as some other students, but I feel personally that these other endeavors are equally important. as a side note, I’m mainly interested in theoretical physics, which means I’ve never had extended research experience in a physical lab and therefore have never had to spend a lot of time in lab. if I had been more interested in experimental physics, I can imagine that my lifestyle would be much more structured than it currently is and overall pretty different. pretty helpful, but also not as helpful as you might think. I came in having taken AP Physics C, proof-based multivariable calculus and differential equations, a few introductory programming classes, and having read a little bit of Griffiths’ Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. I thought I might be able to spend more time doing research in college, but a lot of subfields in theoretical physics have a pretty high barrier to entry and it turns out I spent way more time in classes (it’s not even close). on one hand this makes it difficult for many students to figure out what they’re interested in and to commit to theory as a career, but on the other hand it’s quite humbling and even reassuring to realize that the gap between a graduate or industry researcher and an incoming first-year student in college is much larger that the typical gap within incoming students. even if your high school didn’t offer any college-level subjects, you would probably be more or less caught up as long as you had a good grasp of the content you learned in the first year at mit. if I did have any advice though, it would be to focus on learning math well first, especially multivar and diffeq, because they’re useful in most technical fields. a lot has already been written by other people, but I think it’s important to include my overall thoughts about attending mit in this post. first, mit was my top choice, but I was only admitted off of the waitlist, and my parents expressed some worries that it would be too competitive. until last year, I had never read  malcolm gladwell’s essays on the big-fish-small pond effect I had heard many times that the main benefits of these places are the peers and the network, but I think the reality is more nuanced. like other private schools, mit has the benefit of financial resources that they can give to students and campus groups, which is great for exploring activities and meeting people and grabbing free food; not to mention, they tend to be fairly generous with financial aid. a large endowment itself enables all of these aspects of the experience. obviously, it’s also been really cool to meet so many faculty that are experts in their field, though I don’t think fame always correlates with quality of mentoring. ultimately, mit is a school, and one other reason that I feel my time here was so rewarding is that I just really enjoy taking classes and learning. I think the most difficult thing I had to internalize was that  . maybe it shouldn’t be surprising in hindsight, because so many interesting novels are about growing up and dealing with change, but in high school I didn’t really think about myself as in the process of growing up. I chatted with an old research mentor last year, who told me that he had seen many graduate students not prioritize their own mental health and support networks as they navigated research and adult life, and suffer as a result. it seems obvious that everyone deserves to have their emotional needs met, but I hadn’t realized how important this was to hear from a mentor figure until I finally did. all this is not to say that studying physics and math wasn’t at times long-winded, meandering, and extremely frustrating. but even though physics is hard, the rest of life can feel even weirder. personally, I’ve found it very helpful to focus on the positives at each turning point in my life, and those are the feelings that have stuck with me. p.s. an alternative title for this post is “on my love”. happy late international women in stem + valentine’s day! #guest post

Hi. I’m Andi. I’m twenty years old and already a pigeon addict. It all started seven years ago with that book by
 
SASOL ⁠ 01 South African Synthetic Oil Oh, how innocent it looks… “Come on, dude, just try some. All the smart kids are reading it.” Initially, I knew better than to trust a book written by a gas company. I tried holding out, but I was young and wanted to fit in, so peer pressure eventually made me cave in. “Okay, fine! … but just one page.” I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and flipped to a random page. Little did I know that as soon as my eyes opened and fell upon the words “ ”, my life would change forever. People say that this type of media, a nonfiction book, doesn’t get you hooked as the others do – that it doesn’t tell stories quite as compelling as blockbusters or books about wizards. I knew countless people who ventured into the Marvel Cinematic Universe or even, heavens forbid, the MIT Admissions Blogs, but cases of nonfiction books having the same effect were few and far between. I thought I was safe, so I let my guard down, but I was more susceptible to the book’s contents than I thought. Immediately, I felt my eyes drawn to the colorful illustrations of the common feral pigeon on the page. I’d never realized the
 
brown, red, gray, and white pigeons ⁠ 02 Not to mention all the in-between cookies-and-cream patterns. An egg-ceptionally gorgeous ash-red pigeon in snow. One page turned into a chapter, then two, then ten. In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed. Even after stepping away from the book, I couldn’t stop thinking about pigeons. My first instinct when seeing a flock would be to pull out my phone and snap a picture. I learned how to identify them based on their coos alone; for some, even their wing-flapping sounds! All this so I could spot rare pigeons as quickly as possible. (It certainly didn’t help that these birds were everywhere.) With every passing week, I craved more knowledge about these delightful birds. Before long, I’d moved past the book and onto National Geographic documentaries. I thought they’d surely answer all my lingering questions about pigeons, but they only raised even more questions.
 
How can something the shape and size of a large potato fly at 150 km/h? ⁠ 03 Apparently they're just very muscular and aerodynamic. Plus some separation anxiety when pigeon racing. 
Why and how do some species make whistling noises when they flap their wings? ⁠ 04 Some species have special wing feathers that vibrate to warn surrounding birds about imminent danger. 
And how can they always navigate home without Google Maps? ⁠ 05 They have magnetite in their bodies that they use as compasses. It wasn’t just their physical abilities that fascinated me, either. I was intrigued by their social behaviors and the way they interacted with each other and with humans. I learned that they’re incredibly loyal to their partners. I observed how they’d share food, even if it meant going hungry themselves. And I marveled at their intelligence, their ability to recognize human faces and even understand basic commands. A clever pigeon at the coo-mputer. I thought that going to MIT would force me to quit my pigeon obsession; after all, only two species of pigeons live in Massachusetts. But with so many tall buildings and New York City within driving distance, this proved quite the opposite. My camera roll continued to grow with zoomed-in pictures of fat pigeons sitting on high ledges, and I joined a pigeon-themed lounge in Simmons. Even the first thing I made using
 
CAD ⁠ 06 Computer-aided design. a (somewhat misproportioned but still charming) pigeon Of course, these activities didn’t go unnoticed by those around me. I started receiving pigeon-themed gifts from my friends for my birthdays and Christmas – plush toys, 3D-printed figurines, and even an inflatable mascot! And even outside my friend group, my reputation precedes me – a few days ago, a freshman I knew forgot my name and referred to me as “pigeon man” instead!

IHTFP Previous Next We make fun of the architecture a lot here, but sometimes, MIT really does look nice. Unfortunately, these are not recent photos. No snow lies on this ground this Valentine’s Day (though of course, love is in the air). These two photos are from Valentine’s Day 2013, during my first time on MIT’s campus — and I’ve spent the past week thinking about how it has been a  decade  since MIT entered my life. It’s been a while since I’ve blogged. While I’d like to blog (both on here and not), I haven’t been. Finding time to sit back and reflect and then put it all into words in a way that reflects what I think is  difficult . And finding that time (especially when blogging isn’t my “job” anymore), even harder. Many things in my life are still the same. I’m still a grad student . Still trying to do research on education and finding it hard, and also thinking about what the  most important questions in education  are to me. I’m still in a cappella. I still really like orange. But not all is the same. My hair is growing out. I just bought a new bike  (also orange). I’m living on campus again, but this time as Graduate Resident Advisor (GRA) in a different dorm. I’ll be leaving my a cappella group this spring, and have written a sappy, sentimental, slightly-dramatic “senior” solo to end my time in the group. It’s sometimes hard to notice all of the things that are different.  Back in 2013, I was a science fair kid. I’d been doing a long series of projects on the effect of radiation on the growth of plants, and, to cut a long story short, got to attend the AAAS Annual Meeting in Boston that year. MIT, at that point in time, was somewhat of a mythical place. I was only in 8th grade, and while I probably had heard of MIT, I don’t think I knew anything beyond “oh it’s good at science” and “college is a really long way away”. I was there with a hundred or so other science fair people from across the country, and we got to tour around different parts of MIT. (I have a vague memory of visiting the Broad Institute, and some Googling suggests that Dr. Mandana Sassanfar organized it all. Thanks, Mandana!) To be honest, I don’t have any strong memories of my impressions of the place, as it was literally a decade ago; but, I can definitely say that I knew that MIT existed after that trip. I know that MIT was in my mind at least a little bit, though. Almost all of my messaging in high school happened over
 
Google Hangouts ⁠ 01 rip It’s funny to look back and see that economics was on my mind as a potential career option back in 2014. But also, I know I didn’t have a good sense of economics then
 
(particularly, only seeing its relationship to the stock market). ⁠ 02 a tenuous connection at best Reflecting on how MIT has changed me (and as a result, how I view this institution) is hard. There’s the first problem of figuring out exactly how I’ve changed. Then, I need to account for my own “MIT-tinted googles”: for the past 6 years, the longest I’ve been away from Cambridge is just 3 months. Not a lot of time separated, all things considered. Even if I get past that, though, there’s a bigger problem: it’s unfair to credit all of those changes just to MIT. While yes, these changes did happen  at  MIT, they also might have happened  without  MIT. Some of it could be just leaving home for the first time, growing older, or just generally maturing. It could be the people I’ve met — while we were brought together because of MIT, is it really  because  of MIT that I then had that change, or would it also have happened anywhere else I went? It’s impossible to reflect and pinpoint the causes of changes with certainty because we’ll never know the counterfactuals . There’s no  alternate-universe-self Two examples (and these two, I think, are the main things that learned from MIT): I feel like I’m capable of doing difficult things. Here, the MIT-centered narrative is clear: MIT is a difficult place. I took difficult classes, spent many late nights psetting, and now, I generally feel like
 
I can do things that are “hard” ⁠ 03 of course, some of the ways that i’ve learned this are by being working much with other people, being reasonable in my commitments, taking time for self-care (also, see the next bullet point). i definitely do not view myself as a super-person who can handle literally anything that gets thrown my way in isolation. nothing can make one be like that. I don’t want to be a person that keeps pushing myself academically. Perhaps because of the fact that I  could  choose to devote my whole life to academics and economics have I realized that I don’t really want to. I like having other areas of my life — teaching, singing, socializing, and just time for rest and introspection — because my life doesn’t feel good when I am spending all of my time on just “work”. Instead, I like centering my life around people, and valuing the parts of my life that let me connect with others. But perhaps this was just a natural part of leaving high school and growing up and maturing. Whether I’d have discovered this about myself anywhere else — who knows. I can also point to
 
dozens of other ways in which I’ve changed over the last six years, ⁠ 04 enjoying teaching; caring about organizational culture, and what makes communities work; knowing that i’m bad at prioritizing socialness; feeling more adult, but also more lonely, in grad school why  something happened rather than just being content with observing that it  did  happen — after all, some believe that storytelling is what makes us human . Truth be told, I didn’t think a lot about MIT — or college at all — during most of high school. During my sophomore year, a good friend of mine who was one year older went to MIT for a science research camp, and I remember hearing about how cool he thought MIT was. He got in the next year — but eventually chose to not go. While panicking about what I’d do the summer after my junior year, I applied to a (now non-existent) summer camp at MIT on entrepreneurship. My incredibly cringe-y application was rejected (the correct decision, I think) — but that summer I ended up in Boston anyways,
 
teaching at a small math camp. ⁠ 05 my first time teaching with big stakes, and where i started falling in love with teaching have  been through MIT. It was that summer I had to start thinking about applying to colleges: doing research about different colleges, reading their websites, and of course, inevitably stumbling on the MIT Blogs. I sent a few links around to friends — my (continued) consideration of economics led me here , this post  really started making me feel like a senior. Yet, I didn’t fall in love with MIT, partly because I didn’t let myself — as much as I liked everything I saw about MIT, I didn’t want to get my hopes up about getting in. In hindsight, I wish I did, for to love is to be vulnerable , and hoping for things is part of the joy of life. But despite believing that I’d be rejected, I got in — and very quickly started absorbing everything about MIT that I could. A livecast with some bloggers let me see the human side of this institution, and how cool the people were. I started reading every blog I could. And I quickly grew so excited about the chance to come to MIT. To write this section, I went back and looked through dozens and dozens of chats that I had in high school. It’s so interesting going back and re-experiencing the awe of “how in the world did I get in”, the hope that I had for what college could be like, seeing my awkwardness and anxiety and nerdiness of 7 years prior. Most importantly, I got to re-read all of these chats and relive a little bit of the friendships that I had back then; while I’m still close with many of those people, many is not all. That is alright, though, because people change and lives change, and sometimes, people just drift apart. But, to any high school friends who happen to read this — know that I’m incredibly grateful for you, and love you lots <3 During a cappella auditions this past weekend, I mentioned that I was drafting this post; after learning how long I’ve been here, one of the members of our group asked me, almost incredulously, “are you not tired of this place yet?” It’s a fair question — I’ve been here for literally a quarter of my life, and by the time that I leave, it’ll be the longest I’ve ever stayed in one place. At this point, I know Cambridge and Boston in and out. I can navigate almost anywhere without needing to stop and check directions on the way. I have been to almost every single restaurant within a mile of MIT. And while there’s much more to explore (down in Boston, out to any of the suburbs), I have seen a lot of it. Exploring Cambridge and Boston didn’t really start until graduate school; I didn’t leave campus too much during my first few years, and only when I started living off-campus did I start feeling more connected to the town as a whole. I still don’t think I have that much connection to it, but at this point, it feels stronger than my ties to Nevada. I’ve witnessed a lot of change at MIT. New buildings are always being made. There’s a  new president . There are new people; in my time at MIT, I’ve been around people from the Class of 2018 to the Class of 2026, and by the time I leave, the incoming first-years will be the Class of 2031. Perhaps part of the reason MIT itself doesn’t feel old yet is that I’ve kept having new experiences with new people: new roommates my freshman year, new people in every club I joined, becoming a part of the economics graduate student community, and more. But at this point in my life, especially with so few friends from college still in the area, I feel like my social life has stagnated a little, and that I might start feeling a bit more tired of MIT in the next few years. So, after all of this time, how do I view MIT now? For me, what made MIT special was the people. As an undergrad, meeting amazing people who kept challenging the ways I think, inspiring me to be more, or helping me to better person. As a graduate student, being a part of a cohort that supports each other through the long journey of research, and also getting to watch current undergrads learn to appreciate the same things I did. But how much of that is MIT? Or is it just me choosing to be a part of communities that had these kinds of people, and this would have happened anywhere? Who knows. In education more broadly, I think that too much public consciousness goes toward places like MIT (and other elite colleges). While they are important, they are not overly so. MIT has 4000 undergraduates;  16  million  people  in the United States go to college right now, over half of them  at colleges accepting over two-thirds of applicants. I came to MIT partially because of wanting to feel challenged. It did that for me, and I am glad. I grew a lot here, in many ways. At the same time, I wonder if MIT needs to be as hard as it is. I deeply appreciated the amount of self-governance that undergrads received: the ability to make choices about how their living group operated, the  input we got to give into larger policy decisions , the freedom to crazy events ( 2000 students on campus ?!), and more. This autonomy has led to wonderful amounts of creativity and quirkiness that make MIT unique, and it feels like some in the MIT administration don’t understand how valuable that culture is. (See  here  and here  for other relevant reading.) There is a lot to be said about the amount of resources that MIT has — classes, professors, research opportunities, funding for fun projects, massive career fairs — but I’m pretty sure it’s all been said already. Anything I say on it has no use. As a tour guide, I often said that “everyone at MIT is passionate about
 
something; ⁠ 06 where “something” extends far beyond academics: performing arts, fun hobbies, or even just being a good friend …but now that it’s been a few years, I also see that this has a drawback; namely it leads to some amount of
 
homogeneity ⁠ 07 i’ll note that one of the reasons i chose mit was because of this homogeneity; mit was much more similar to my high school than the big other option i had, and i didn’t feel ready for an experience that would be totally unfamiliar ’ , and it means that it can feel bad to just do things for yourself. It ’s not easy to let go of this feeling . (I think I’m much better at it now than I was, say, four years ago, but it’s still hard.) I’m aware that none of these are new observations. They ’ I do deeply love MIT. It has been wonderful to me, and I’m so lucky to be here. I have never regretted coming here, and if I had to go back, I’d happily choose MIT again. At the same time, it’s important to remember that MIT is just another place. A very special place with so much to offer; but also, the parts of MIT that really make it special can be found everywhere. MIT is not perfect; but also, no place is. It’s been ten years since I first stepped foot on MIT’s campus. By the time I leave here (presuming I graduate when I think I will), I’ll have been here for ten years. A decade. Over a third of my life. I’ll be here for four more years. I’m thinking of all of the ways that I changed in high school and undergrad — both four-year periods — and realizing that I have that amount of time  left  here in Cambridge. What kind of person will I be, come 2027? How will I change (either because of, or in spite of, MIT)? How will MIT change? I guess we’ll see. Previous Next IHTFP. #i'm old

Over IAP, I joined the ranks of bloggers who have fallen into the  black hole fiber arts At the end of last semester, the
 
UA Incomm ⁠ 01 the undergrad association innovation committee! they do a lot of cool projects around campus -- the banana lounge is actually an incomm project As I was scrolling through the options, admiring all the cool things people were selling, I saw a crocheted strawberry cow. … I couldn’t go to the market myself since I had something going on at that time, but I asked my friend Tiffany L. ’24 to get a strawberry cow  from the artist djfhgksdfkjghsdfg so cute After that, it was settled: I needed to learn how to crochet so that I could make stuffed animals like that. But I was so intimidated by all the terminology and the complexity of patterns and the neck-breaking speed that some people crocheted at that I kept putting it off. Still, I’d find myself inevitably lingering on the crochet videos that popped up on my feed. At the same time, I’d gotten myself a shiny new UROP for IAP. It was my first time working in a wet lab after two attempts at computational UROPs that I eventually dropped. During onboarding, I offhandedly mentioned wanting to learn how to crochet to one of my direct supervisors, which was how I found out that they were   obsessed with crocheting. So was the new grad student that joined at the same time I did, and there were two other people that knit. For a relatively small lab with about ten or so people, that’s a lot of fiber artists. (There’s also an interestingly large percentage of people in the lab that don’t drive, including my supervisors, and my PI didn’t get his license until three or four years ago.) (…I felt right at home. At this point I don’t think I’m going to learn how to drive anytime soon.) Fiber arts became a frequent topic in my conversations with other lab members. When I told my supervisor that I wanted to get into amigurumi, which is the art of crocheting stuffed animals, they gave me a whole bag of extra stuffing left over from one of their projects. They also sent me info about a  queer fiber arts circle Boston Fiber Company. I’d started crocheting just two days before, with some slightly sad-looking attempts at flowers. These were the first things I’d ever made. oh girl…. The last one didn’t look so bad!! But needless to say, I was not an expert. It was okay, though, because there was a wide range of skill levels, and everyone at the event was so incredibly nice. “I’m here because making friends in your twenties is  , and I’m hoping fiber arts can help me meet new people,” one person said. “That’s smart of you,” someone else said. “I’ve never met a mean knitter. I mean, the community is just so incredible.” And it’s exactly that sense of community that makes me so happy whenever I think about crocheting. People are more than willing to help others out, whether by sharing tutorials or resources. There are so many beautiful creations out there and an overwhelming sense of positivity. I slowly got better at crocheting. I would come home from a long day at my UROP, collapse in my chair, and crochet for hours. I finished my first big project, a brown and white

This semester, I’ve been given the chance to crochet things for the Lounge and buy as much yarn as I need. There’s a whole world of possibilities: amigurumi bananas? Leaf bunting for the doorways? Various amigurumi fruits? I’m really glad that I found crocheting at this time in my life. After years of being too art-blocked to draw, it’s given me another creative outlet, and the physical element of creating something makes it feel absolutely magical. TLDR: please talk to me about crocheting it’s the only thing i ever want to talk about these days i want to see your projects and hear about your favorite types of yarn. i love you all happy valentines day

This semester, I’m taking a wide array of classes, from music to media studies to English, and as a result, I’ve had to consume a lot of different media forms for my assignments! Here’s everything I’ve consumed this first week of classes. I’m taking two music-ish classes, 21M.150 Intro to Music Theory and CMS.S60 Rap Theory and Practice. Although Lupe himself has said that CMS.S60 is not a music class, it is a media studies class, we do listen to music in and out of class and study it. This week, we focused on the importance of names and the power of them, having to write a rap about our chosen rap names. For this, we were assigned to listen to  Hi My Name Is by Eminem What’s My Name by Snoop Dogg We Want Eazy by Eazy E I also listened to some extra raps for inspiration, particularly looking at female rappers, Filipino rappers, and female Filipino rappers. I listened to a   of 90s hip hop as my inspiration like A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, and Wu Tang Clan. I really leaned into Lauryn Hill’s  , listening to the album cover to cover a couple of times. And I compiled also a playlist of music I wanted as inspiration for my rhythm and flow for the class: It’s been really interesting trying to find out my style and I feel like I’m listening a lot more intentionally to the rappers I listen to. From my initial raps, I could tell that a lot of my flow was influenced so much by rappers I was already super acquainted with (J. Cole, Kendrick, Big Sean) and it was really surprising to see how much I internalized their styles and flows unintentionally, never having rapped before. For the class, we also watched some videos on language and the brain. These videos essentially emphasized the importance of the body as an instrument and means of rapping, and how all of this is a system working together to produce noises, flows, and rhythm. We also read an excerpt from Donald S. Passman’s  All You Need to Know About the Music Business: 10th Edition which talked about the importance of choosing a name and the thought and consideration that goes into such a decision, such as checks for copyright claims, memorability, and iconic-ness. Having already taken this class last year, I kind of have already seen the majority of this content for this class, but I still do the readings just so I’m in the know and can better understand and gauge the discussion. For this class we read Jenny Odell’s  “A Business With No End” Crawford and Joler’s “Anatomy of an AI System: The Amazon Echo as an anatomical map of human labor, data, and planetary resources.” These were, in my opinion, really great articles to open with since I think it tackles all of the major themes of the class of exploitation, hidden labor, data privacy, nonhuman agents, and more. It also implores people to start thinking critically about where their information and products come from, how products get from A to Z, and really the muddiness of “the Internet” as an entity in general. This class has some really great readings that really have shed light and colored my perspective on essentially every interaction I have with the Internet as a whole. This class specifically focuses on comic books and the role of race and gender in superhero traditional comic books. For this week, we focused on Superman and his representation in the comics. We looked at: Action Comics #1 Lois Lane #106 Superman vs. Muhammad Ali Superman Action Comics Vol. 2 #9 I felt that this class was a good next step after my writing comics class last semester and it’s been really interesting really deep diving into comics and no longer looking at their techniques from a writing perspective, but as a reader. I’m taking an intro music theory class and to learn rhythms (eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc.) our music professor made us clap along to Kendrick Lamar’s Swimming Pools, which was an incredibly hilarious and surreal moment. Bless your heart, Garo. For my encoding culture class which looks at how media is represented digitally and how we can use various practices and tools to manipulate and analyze said encoded media, we read some introductory readings on the importance of humanities data and some general precautions to take when doing such work. We looked at an excerpt from  D’Ignazio and Klein’s Data Feminism  from data, and essentially pushes against the aphorism “The numbers speak for themselves.” I’ve read some other things from Data Feminism in CMS.614 so the familiar names were comforting. I’ve always enjoyed what D’Ignazio and Klein have to say and I found this particular chapter so impactful, especially as someone that goes to such a prominent STEM school like MIT. Despite being one of the best schools in the country, a lot of our students fall victim to the idea that you can throw computer science or algorithms or really just STEM at any world problem to fix it and often fail to take into account the important of  of the   behind the problem, realizing that these are not merely numbers or data points but have a grounding in reality, in people, in places, in life. We also looked at  Posner’s “Humanities data: A necessary contradiction” Schöch’s “Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the humanities”

I spent the last two weeks of IAP abroad. I had thought about applying for
 
GTL, ⁠ 01 global teaching labs, a MISTI program that places students in schools abroad to teach short courses 
Kano ⁠ 02 blogger crossover!! I flew back from Europe on February 3rd, which coincided with a record-breaking cold wave in Boston. As I waited for my Lyft in the frigid parking lot of Boston Logan airport, my friend, K., texted me asking what was taking me so long to get back, since it had already been a couple of hours since landing. I said I was on my way. She told me to hurry up. When I walked into my room twenty minutes later, I found her and two more of my friends in there, hanging out, waiting for me to get back. Over the course of the last semester, my room has become a lounge of sorts, a gathering place for people on
 
the floor. ⁠ 03 when I say the floor, I mean Burton 1, my living group K. and T. on my bed You see, I’ve been feeling old lately. I watch K. and the other freshmen run around B1 and think about how I used to be where they are
 
now: ⁠ 04 except not really, because fuck the pandemic 
two. ⁠ 05 due to both the pandemic and the renovation of Burton Conner Because where am I? I’m starting my junior spring, which means I have just three semesters left at this school. I’ve been here long enough that when my younger friends ask me for advice, I’m able to give it. I barely go out anymore; I usually go to bed at the oh-so-early hour of 1 AM. I’ve quit so many of the clubs that once meant a lot to me.
 
I blog less. ⁠ 06 though I am trying to be better about this one . I’m more focused on a smaller number of things, and it feels good. I feel calm. I’ve had time to figure enough things out. For once, I feel more stable than not. When I was in elementary school,  a teacher once told me that she thought I would make a better adult than I did a child. Setting aside the ethics of saying that to a child, I was glad to hear it at the time. I think she understood the vague unease I felt as kid: always a little weird, often quiet, and generally unsure of how to approach other people. As I grew up, that unease slowly melted away, both thanks to experience and deliberate efforts on my part. This is to say that I’ve never really been sad about getting older. I’ve always felt ready for the future, excited even, because I knew it would be more comfortable than the present. With age came more opportunities, more freedom, more confidence. Although I didn’t have an awful time in high school, I remember it feeling like a precursor to college, when my real life would begin. I couldn’t tell you why, exactly, but I must have felt constricted. Socially, I never felt like I completely fit in, and I decided to just
 
wait it out ⁠ 07 I distinctly remember thinking, it must get better, right? and it does. that's what this post is about.  to college that I didn’t have a lot of time or energy to focus on my happiness. So, coming to MIT felt revolutionary, because it was. Since coming here, I have had the chance to live many lives, to embody several different versions of myself. I’ve gone through many social circles. Every year, I’ve lived in a new dorm. I’ve taken classes in many different fields. I’ve reshuffled my priorities like a deck of cards. Now, though, I think I’m done with the drastic changes. I’m sitting in my dorm room in BC and I feel content in a way I haven’t before at MIT. I’m ridiculously happy with my living situation: B1 feels like home in a way that I didn’t really believe I would find in college. I’ve sorted out my academic priorities, and I see a clear path forward into my future. I’m working on research that I’m passionate about and feel agency over. I’ve decided that I want to take a gap year, but also that I want to apply to grad schools in the fall. I have a general sense of what work interests me, and what I want out of my career. I finally have a direction to move in, but for once in my life I’m not in a rush to get to the destination. It’s not even that I’ve never before focused on the present. For a long time after first getting to MIT, I couldn’t really think about the future because I had no idea what it would look like. It felt like standing at the edge a cliff, looking down into the abyss, scared to take the plunge. That was a sort of present-mindedness, but it was forced. I had to focus on my present  the future was so uncertain. The contentedness I feel now is completely different. I could race into the future, I could keep looking ahead. I just don’t want to. I know it will come, and I’m not in a hurry. I feel old, and it’s weird and bittersweet. I’m glad I have had enough time here to find myself and some degree of serenity. As much as I’m jealous of the energy and innocence of the freshmen, I don’t actually want it. I’m sad only because there isn’t that much left, now. This semester will pass, and then another, and then I’ll be staring straight down the road to graduation. Where did the time go? For the first time in maybe ever, I don’t want any of this to end. I know that I’ll be ready when it inevitably does, and I know that I will grow so much more in the time that I have left here. And yet it doesn’t feel so pressing, not anymore. I’m not in a rush. I’ll finish writing this blog, and then I’ll close this tab. I’ll walk out into the kitchen, where E. is making

On the morning of the second day of classes, I got a newsletter email from CAST with a  video When I met with my advisor to approve my classes last week, I had 60 units of classes on my pre-registration. I only need to take three classes–biology, a writing class, and a thesis prep class. “I understand the ‘buffet’ is closing,” my advisor said and emphasized that it would be in my best interest to reduce my workload, especially in my last semester. The next day my friend would tell me about another class on computational art that took everything in me not to add to my schedule.  Above all else, I love learning. I have taken so many cool and interesting classes both within and outside my major that have truly impacted and shaped me. I’ll miss so much being a student whose sole responsibility is to learn. To find answers to the endless amount of questions I have about this world. To be given free resources to experiment and prototype and pursue almost any project only bound by my own limitations. Looking back, I wish I took advantage of the resources better. Though to be fair to me, MIT doesn’t do the best job advertising the wealth of its resources, and the pandemic rendered most of them inaccessible for almost two years anyways. But alas, reason doesn’t always diminish regret.  On the morning of the second day of classes, I woke up two hours before my first class so I could have enough time to calmly get  
ready. ⁠ 01 </span>I spent the last week of IAP in LA and got back just the day before the first day of classes. I found myself unable to sleep until past 3 am and woke up only five hours later for my 9 am class on the first day of classes. I was beyond tired the whole day. I’m too old to not get eight hours of sleep. But, it helped fixed my sleep schedule, at least for now, before classes ramp up and ruin it once more. 
show. ⁠ 02 right now it's Criminal Minds, which I've already seen years ago but I'm rewatching. This year I also watched Desperate Housewives, Fringe, and a few other shows. 
music ⁠ 03 Beyonce and SZA on rotation with a little bit of Ice Spice here and there In high school, I remember reading about Zuckerberg’s choice to wear the same type of shirt every day so as to minimize decision fatigue. Frankly, I never understood this, even in high school when I only wore the same few shirts and jeans in rotation. Is the decision of what to wear that much of a burden to cause decision fatigue? I can imagine this is the case for lots of people for many different reasons, but he has all the money in the world to afford to outsource that decision to a stylist who can build the ultimate  
wardrobe. ⁠ 04 maybe that's the flex. I don't care, and I'll still be richer tomorrow. but lowkey that's fashion icon behavior. read: thedailybeast.com/mark-zuckerberg-in-the-social-network-fashion-icon Work attire would come up in a few coffee chats I’d have with engineers during my various tech internships. From the conversations and my own observations, I gathered that for women at least there was this game of putting in enough effort to look more presentable but ensuring that it looked effortless. Only my first summer internship during my freshman year was in person, so I didn’t really have to play that game. And even if I did, it would only be in the summers. But as graduation and my entry into the full-time job market approaches, I find myself beginning to preemptively mourn the loss of my little morning dress-up party routine. So maybe it hasn’t been a completely happy first week of classes. But God I’m so happy to be at the finish line. Previous Next

i’ve never done misti, which is mit’s international experience thing. i was given the chance, in april 2021, to spend the first half of 2022 in imperial college london. i spent a few days thinking about the decision, and talking to people, and declined in the end, because i “didn’t want to spend that much time away from mit.” i never applied to a misti program again. do i regret it, saying no? if i went, i would’ve missed doing mystery hunt with galactic, missed my first in-person cpw, missed going to tech squares weekend, maybe missed doing my internship. if i went, maybe i would’ve had fun doing things and meeting people in london. but knowing how badly i keep in touch with people, i’d have stopped talking to any new friends i made by now. that doesn’t mean it’s not worth it, making friends you see for but a few months. that’s what summer camp is, and i enjoyed my summer camps. but part of me yearns for relationships that last longer. for the selfish reason of having someone i’m comfortable with, when i need someone. maybe i need a boyfriend, or two or three. but i’m scared of that kind of commitment. two nights ago i had dinner with wayne, one of my best friends in mit. we’ve been friends since we were both frosh. we see each other regularly, whether it’s in esp meetings or worksessions or bumping into each other in hallways. i’d expected another semester of being together, but he told me a few weeks ago that he’s taking leave this semester. two nights ago i had dinner with wayne, and that’d be the last time we’d see each other in-person, for a long time. i started this year thinking we’d get to spend more time together before we graduated and i left mit. now, unless some coincidence happens, we’ll never live within a few minutes walk of each other, ever again. we went to the mccormick dining hall. he lined up in the stirfry line. i didn’t get stirfry often, but that night i stood next to him in line. i squeezed every minute i could being with him. it wasn’t enough. i wasn’t ready to say goodbye. what would’ve changed, if i had a semester instead of an hour? i’m answering this question live, with all my other friends in mit. graduation will be the last time i’d see many of them, yet i’m going on with this semester as if nothing’s gonna change. maybe nothing will change; maybe goodbye stings no matter how long you prepare. i’ve been growing apart from others, but not growing nearer to others in exchange. i feel my social energy’s weaker, enough that i have to budget who to spend my time with. as soon as i graduate from mit, all my mit friends get put on a counter, counting down the number of times i’ll see them again in-person before i die. for most of them, it’ll be never. for others it’ll be around yearly. maybe i’ll see them fifty times before i die, maybe a hundred. by the time i graduate, i’ll have used 90% of my time with these friends, maybe more. some of these people i call best friends. i’m not ready to say goodbye to them. maybe i never will be.

This IAP, I’ve gone to Brazil!  I’m taking WGS.245: Race, Place, and Modernity. It’s a class focused on Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous Brazilian culture, with tons of readings, movies, and museum visits each week. The class takes place in Sao Paulo, Brazil, so we’re engaged night and day in the setting we’re learning about. I find myself swept up in the intensity, bouncing from adventure to deep discussion and back again. Here’s a taste of what I’ve done. Sao Paulo is full of murals — we saw this one on the drive from the airport I managed to pack just one suitcase
 
this time, ⁠ 01 when I went to Denmark, I foolishly brought three Each day, we uber to the Brazilian British Center (BBC), a building of white marble surrounded by a mossy moat. There we discuss the day’s readings until 12:30. The readings cover Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous history, culture, forms of resistance and ways of life. There is also focus on Black women and queer narratives. The class is 20 people, mostly seniors, who are quite knowledgeable about the topics we cover. This is probably the most high-level HASS class I have taken at MIT; our discussions are complex and sometimes intense. I love learning with this group of people, and sometimes feel that I glean as much from a classmate’s perspective on the readings as I did from the readings themselves. After discussion is over, we have a long break for lunch. We usually split off into groups and explore the restaurants around the BBC. There are a wide variety of cuisines in every neighborhood of Sao Paulo; so far I’ve had Mexican, Thai, Indian, Peruvian, Americanized Italian, and of course many types of Brazilian food. All of the former were less spicy than their counterparts in America. As it turns out, Brazilian food has little spice. Previous Next Next we head to a lecture or museum. The variety of museums in Brazil has proven to be truly amazing. Some of my favorites were:  the Afro-Brazilian Museum, which had pieces from so many time periods and places of the African diaspora. I found some beautiful ironwork from Benin, as well as modern iron sculptures. Our guide, Raphaellie, was incredible. She brought us from interpretations of modern Brazilian artists to breaking down and re-structuring colonial narratives in traditional European art. Previous Next Instituto Moreira Salles, a photography museum with an exhibit on Indigenous videography. The videographers were Indigenous youth who were documenting their own communities with the approval and involvement of community elders. Posters, not magazines, also by collectives and other radical groups We were also lucky enough to have a lecture and Q-and-A session with Juliana Borges, an activist who fights for prison abolition in Brazil. While Brazil’s mass incarceration differs in some ways from America — for example Brazil has fewer private prisons — the crux of the issue, ie: incarceration as a method for the state to control Black and brown bodies, is the same. I was especially interested in how Borges works both within the governmental system and in groups outside of it to pressure leaders and push for change. I’d recommend her essay “Black Women Under Fire.” an orixá of the Candomblé religion In the past two weeks, I’ve absorbed a lot, and I’m still processing. I’ve studied systems of oppression and resistance in my personal life and via MIT classes, namely through a class on the Latinx diaspora and another on race and the environment. I can feel that WGS.245 is pushing my learning further, and I’m grateful for that.  After class, we return to the hotel. I usually either run or crash, depending on the hour. Sao Paulo is an unfamiliar city, and I avoid running after dark.  The night is ours to burn. We usually have a movie and/or a few hours of reading due the next day, so I try to tackle that. My first week, when some friends were in town, I also went out nearly every night. Brazil has an active nightlife, and we’ve romped through a wide variety of venues. By far my favorite trip (though not my favorite location) was when a Brazilian friend of mine asked our Uber driver for recs. Our driver suggested a venue, called his friend for more ideas, and then showed us pictures of his partner, daughter, and dogs. The dogs were corgis. street market in Liberdade neighborhood We travel everywhere by Uber, since it’s faster and cheaper than the rail system. Drivers in Sao Paulo are in my opinion incredible: it’s a hilly city, and everyone drives stick. The cars are close-packed and tiny, and drivers maneuver into spaces that I would never dare to wriggle into. Traffic lanes are more of a suggestion — once when the highway was empty enough, my driver couldn’t decide which lane to join, so he drove right down the dashed white line between them. Red lights are generally obeyed, but with more leeway than in the US, which I’ve had to be aware of each time I cross a street. My international friend finds all of this entirely normal, but it took me a few days to relax when I get into the front seat.  another mural When last weekend came around, we went to Rio de Janeiro as a class to visit a few museums and sites. We also stopped by the beach at night — the water was so warm — and wandered through the city. I love the nature all around, the small mountains and patches of jungle. Before we went back, I ran down the beach, splashing in the water, dodging around couples, groups of friends playing football, and children and their parents. Tourists and locals covered every square foot of beach. I saw the mountainside where there used to be a waterfall, considered the environmental impact of swarms of tourists, as well as the impact of emissions from Brazil and the global north alike. Even so, I was happy to see so many people enjoying the ocean. Copacabana beach, Rio, just after sunset I can’t wait for the next
 
two weeks ⁠ 02 quite fun, so much that I didn't get back to this blog until right now.

As of yesterday, I am officially a second semester senior. Every minute that passes by feels crucial, like not a second is even to be wasted. I feel this immense pressure to do it  , even though I don’t even quite understand what right means in this case. I spent the first month of this year in Europe, studying abroad in Madrid before going on a whirlwind vacation trip with Raymond through the non-Spanish European cities of London, Paris, and Amsterdam. It was the perfect reset before coming back to Boston, because my time there really made me appreciate how much I missed and loved the Boston-Cambridge area. I also just really missed being in a proper routine. This semester I am taking the most classes I’ve ever taken in my MIT career; not out of a dislike of myself or want of a challenge, but because
 
I need to do this in order to graduate. ⁠ 01 I took too many 3-class semesters and I need 180 units beyond my requirements to graduate and I need 54 more units in order to hit that 180 number. Luckily, my classes this semester are incredibly exciting and weird and pushing me out of my comfort zone. This semester I’m taking:  This is a Harvard class and I’m really enjoying the content so far. We play about one video game a week and talk about it really intensely and everyone in the class has such interesting, profound things to say that I never would have considered.  This class feels as though it was made for me. It’s a special subject class taught by the  Digital Humanities . I had a brief musical stint when I was younger, where I took piano lessons from the second grade to eighth grade. I have some understanding of music theory, but have lost a good chunk of it and have been meaning to get back into it. I plan on taking piano lessons after graduation again and also just ordered a brand new acoustic guitar (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) so really I’m just excited. The professor is an absolute sweetheart and I’ve enjoyed the first session so much, where we spent the time practicing rhythm and sightsinging.  I’ve taken this class before! And I’m TA’ing it! This is Petey’s class on Internet studies which tackles a whole bunch of things but I’m really excited. I’ll be doing a later post this week on everything I’ve read, listened to, watched, and played for my classes so you can see the interesting readings for this class.  Originally I was supposed to take a lamp making class (EM.21) because I realized I’ve never made anything at MIT before and I really want to leave here having learned something about making something physically, but the lamp class ended up conflicting with CMS.S60 so I get to now take this mainly freshman seminar that serves as, well, an introduction to maker skills! I’m super excited to just learn and get introduced to all these new things and skills and machines in a safe, beginner-friendly environment. . So I ended up getting into the class and it is taught by the Lupe Fiasco himself! Rona is also in the class so we have lots of blogger representation (woot woot)! I’m intimidated out of my mind for this class, as I already have a rap due tomorrow (16 bars introducing ourselves; I’m gonna shit myself.) But I think I have a lot to learn from this class. I’m an avid R&B, rap, and hip-hop listener so I really appreciate the fact that we get to listen to so much music in this class and really dissect their meanings and understand the amount of thought, energy, and time that goes into creating any sort of lyrical structure at all. Aside from my classes, I (obviously) plan on continuing blogging as well as being a part of LSC! We actually have a screening of   coming up this weekend, so I’ll be working refreshments with my friends Michelle and Kylee. Really, I want this last semester to be a wholesome farewell to MIT. Last semester felt like a lot of growing pains, for not only just me but all my friend group. We struggled a lot with things like major breakups and finding ourselves and understanding what the future entails, but now that we’ve gone through those pains, we find that we’re looking forward to what the future now holds for us. I have a pretty clear idea of what these next few months look like, and so I’m excited to just dive in head on. I’ve made some pretty big adjustments to my schedule this semester. I’ve switched to a morning schedule, courtesy of Kano (she’s a blogger, you’ll meet her in a bit), who  tweeted a long, long thread I found all these tips incredibly helpful to make my swap to a morning schedule. So far my schedule’s gone a little like this: nsuns c25k This is an incredibly different schedule than what I’ve been doing for the past three years here. Usually I’ve maintained a 1am/2am sleeptime and a 10am wakeup time. This was mainly to avoid fomo; I love hanging out with my friends and wherever they are, I want to be usually, so I thought that this transition to a morning schedule would be difficult. BUT by some miraculous twist of fate, ALL of my friends this semester have switched to a morning schedule. I believe this is actually caused by the fact that we were all in Europe (separately, doing different things) for IAP and so the jetlag has caused us to all wake up at 7am and we’ve just decided to keep it that way. I’m so excited to not only be a morning person but be on the exact same schedule as my friends now too!!! Other updates I have: I’m 21 now which feels like a big boy age and I feel funky and weird about it. I’ve been apartment hunting and will do a huge blog on that once Raymond and I’s housing is finalized. Europe was great and I’ll talk about it more once I get my bearings. And I’m just really excited (and heartbroken? and anxious and nervous and just UAHFLHLKAJFSD) for this semester, my final semester.

Yesterday was the first day of my senior spring, which is also the last first day of my undergraduate studies at MIT. It is the kind of milestone that keeps appearing, with an increasing sense of urgency.  It is the kind of milestone which deserves reflection, but, since I am at least honest enough to acknowledge that it will not receive such thought, I am instead going to erect a shrine to it by documenting everything which occurs, in the style of posts  by Shuli and Cami I mention a lot of building numbers in this post. For more information on these, please go to  whereis.mit.edu helpful CJ blog post 8:50 AM: My first alarm—a primer alarm, just to make sure I’m awake enough to hear the second one—goes off. I turn it off and go back to sleep. 9:15 AM: My second alarm goes off. This time, I acknowledge it. Instead of getting up, I lie in bed, check my email, and read Twitter for a few minutes. It is senior year, and I have gotten the art of “getting to class exactly on time” down to a science; I can afford to waste a few more minutes. 9:19 AM: I finally get out of bed. I go through my morning routine slowly—I don’t believe in breakfast, so I skip it, but even despite that: 9:55 AM: I have gotten an unusually slow start to the day. I put on my jacket, shove my books and laptop into my bag, and I try to book it out of Next House as fast as I can. This is usually a ten-minute walk, but, on a good day, that time can be cut down to seven or eight. 10:04 AM: I am at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Amherst Alley. At MIT, classes start
 
five minutes after their scheduled start time, ⁠ 01 at "MIT time". 10:05 AM: I arrive at 21W.743, which is supposed to be a class on “Voice and Meaning: Speaking to Readers through Memoir,” and which I am attending
 
with the intention to drop. ⁠ 02 this is because it is one of three classes I am signed up for which can satisfy my writing major requirements, and I only need to take one. On the other hand, I also need to get into at least one, and some of the classes have enrollment limits. 10:20 AM: The professor is still not here. I pull out my laptop and start preparing notes for my SuperUROP meeting after class. Two of the people start talking, and, eventually, all five of us are talking to each other, wondering where the professor is. After all, we haven’t gotten any emails from them, or any other emails about the class, so…what’s going on? 10:28 AM: The following conversation ensues: A: This is too much chaos for 10:30 AM. 
Me: This is exactly the right amount of chaos for 10:30 AM. 
B: It’s not 10:30 AM; it’s 10:28 AM.

At the same time, the Wi-fi in the building—and later, it seems, across campus—slows down to the pace of molasses. What else are we supposed to be doing with our time, if not browsing the Internet? 11:14 AM: Someone walks up to the window, jiggles the door handle slightly, and then leaves.

SuperUROP ⁠ 05 SuperUROP is a program where you do research as an undergraduate for a whole year, and sometimes your department gives you a little more money and communications credit. 11:38 AM: I finally make it to my the elevators in the Stata Center and take them up to the eighth floor of the Gates Tower. Just three minutes late—not too bad, all things considered! I’m meeting with the two graduate students and the other SuperUROP I’m working with, on a project about social media regulation. We talk about the work we did last semester, discuss some of the themes of the articles and laws we read, and then begin
 
outlining the paper we want to write. ⁠ 06 highlights of this process include: sections labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and '0' and 'NOT PRETTY' written in all-caps. 12:11 PM: Mid-meeting, I get an email notification that my advisor has approved my subject selections for the term. I click the big button that says “Submit registration” and bam! Now, finally, I am definitely a student at MIT in my senior spring,
 
with classes and all that jazz. ⁠ 07 I met with my advisor last Thursday, during Registration Week, to talk about my subject selections and all that, but he didn't put it into the system until today. Not a huge deal, but it is kinda funny. i’m a real student now! 12:40 PM: Our meeting wraps up. I chat with my fellow SuperUROP for a bit while the elevator takes us back down to the ground floor, and then we part ways. I head over to the Forbes Family Cafe for lunch, where I bump into Jerry M. ’23. I eat my pizza quickly while we talk; neither of us have had our first class of the day yet, but he’s heading off to Harvard for class afterwards, where he’s taking a class on “Financial Crises and Recessions of the 21st Century.” We talk for a little while about it being our senior year, about the way we used to attend all of our classes religiously as freshmen, even if they were at 9 AM. I still have some 9:30 AM classes, although I’m trading that off with having no classes on Friday. Jerry’s classes don’t start until the afternoon, but he still has to get up early so he can work on his research. Then again, our sleep schedules haven’t changed that much; I remember that, in my very first class at MIT—a recitation for 18.022 (Calculus II)—I ended up falling asleep because I’d stayed up too late. 12:55 PM: I finish my pizza. I say goodbye to Jerry and begin my slow wandering towards class, which is nearby in Building 36. Somewhat dazed, lost in the spell of the “free” 10 minutes before a class which ultimately must be squandered, I accidentally pull a push door for longer than I would like to admit. Fortunately, I eventually make it to class. 1:00 PM: It’s not MIT time yet, but the professor is asking how people learned about this class. The answers vary: a

6.S983, ⁠ 09 the 'S' here stands for special subject, which basically just means 'good luck Googling this course in another five years.' In past years, the course has been offered under the number 6.888. We talk over why the class is important or interesting. It turns out hardware attacks are particularly difficult to fix because, often, they are
 
a consequence of desirable characteristics of the design itself, ⁠ 10 for example, in order to make your computer go faster, your CPU sometimes performs something called 'speculative execution,' where it guesses the piece of code it's going to execute next. This is great—until parts of that execution is leftover in some micro-architectural state, and now an attacker can figure out data they weren't supposed to have, because that code was never supposed to run in the first place. However, if you turn this behavior off, computer performance tanks, because it turns out we can get really good at guessing, instead of waiting to know what comes next! You can Google 'Spectre CPU attack' if you want to know more. 
6.004, ⁠ 11 Computation Structures, or, 'what actually goes on between your apps and pure physics.' mmm…notes 2:07 PM: My attention drifts. I check my Discord, where someone has texted me asking if I want to pick up a commitment for later this spring. I’m tempted. I think about it, in the background, for the rest of the day. 2:20 PM: Class begins to wrap up, as we talk about logistics, between all the different kinds of assignments and whatnot. The professor, who I’ve had for some of my other classes in the past, is very nice, but that doesn’t mean the class is going to be easy; she mentions that one of the labs has been considered “really hard” by previous students. “Try Lab 2, and see whether or not you want to drop the course,” she says. “It used to be the first lab in the class…it messed some people up.” Still, I’m impressed by the thoughtful design of the class and the way it’s run, with lots of opportunities for feedback, lots of opportunities to get support on various portions, and very clear communication about deadlines and assignment weighting and so forth. I’m excited; I really like the professor, and I really like this kind of low-level computing, so I think it’s gonna be a good time. 2:24 PM: After class ends, I head over to the fourth floor of Building 12, which happens to be one of my favorite places to work. Along the way, CJ texts me asking if I want to get dinner together. It is at this point I realize I don’t have a dinner break—I’ve got something from 5 to 7, and from 7 to 10. oops I feel a twinge of regret at making such a rookie mistake, but move on quickly. Oh, well. I tell CJ no, and then sit down and work on updating this blog post, fleshing out all the details which have been hastily jotted down in my Google Keep. the view from 12-4 3:26 PM: My writing attention span only lasts an hour. I take a break and check the same four apps I always do: Discord, Gmail, Messenger, and Twitter. 3:44 PM: During my break, I learn that the Student Center—where a pipe burst in the extreme cold over the weekend—is now closed until next Sunday, which means that the production of   I have been orchestra directing is now in
 
even more dire straits. ⁠ 12 we had opening night last Friday, and then our shows on Saturday and Sunday were cancelled for this reason. , a novel assigned for the Harvard class I’m taking this semester: ENGL CNL, or, “The Novel Lab.” The class is very exciting, especially since I get to write fiction again, and I am enjoying the readings a lot, since I haven’t had the time to really read novels outside of classes! On the other hand, it started  , which means I’ve been halfway in school mode ever since. Alas. The rest of my classes this semester are quite varied: I’m taking 6.1220, “Design and Analysis of Algorithms,” as part of my Course 6 major; 21L.486, “Modern Drama,” and 21L.487, “Modern Poetry,” as part of my Course 21W major, since I’ve written a play and a lot of poetry during my time here; 21M.405, the Chamber Chorus; and 6.UAR, which is the class associated with my SuperUROP. It’s a busy semester, but I’m very excited by most of the classes, and I’m able to drop some classes and still graduate, which is great. I am a little saddened to know that there are a lot of classes in subjects I’m interested in that I will never get to take—some deeper dives into chemistry and biology, or some passing interests in physics, mechanical engineering, or political science that I will not be able satisfy here—but such is life. Alas, alas. I make a good amount of progress through the book, which is easy, because the book is good and it keeps me wanting more. I don’t want to stop and take notes, but, unfortunately, I have to in order to get through the class, and so I do. 4:34 PM: I stop reading. I send an email for my acapella group. I look at my to-do list, think about it, and then decide to ignore it. I do the same social media tour as before, and then return to reading; this time, I make my way through some of W.H. Auden’s  , as part of the reading for my thesis. 4:55 PM. I stop again. Time to move myself to my 5 PM obligation. on my walk to my next destination 5:05 PM: I find myself in 38-530, a lab space for electronics that I last stepped foot in Spring 2020, when I took

We haven’t really discussed anything about what to expect on Wednesday, which I’m a little nervous about, but it’s probably fine. I’ve got to get to my next class soon, but I stick around for a few minutes longer, before ditching to go to my next class in 14N-112. I gingerly place my kit at the top of my backpack, which is concerningly full…especially since there are more books to buy in my other classes. 7:03 PM: I arrive outside of 14N-112, where a surprisingly large number of people—including two of my friends!—are gathered, waiting for the start of our class on “Modern Poetry.” The room is locked, and we end up moving over to a random classroom in Building 2 instead, which is just nearby. We spend a concerningly large portion of the class discussing who, exactly, is enrolled in the class, and then proceed to read and discuss Tennyson’s “ Ulysses We talk about the myth of Odysseus, the historical development of the myth, the historical context of Tennyson’s poem and his declamatory use of iambic pentameter, so on and so forth. We compare it to Dante’s description of Ulysses—before the unified documents we now call the   and the  —in Canto 26. It is interesting, but I don’t know what to make of it. Much to think about. 9:05 PM: We take a “five-minute” break which is scheduled to end at 9:12 PM. I get up, stretch my legs, and eat some cookies and oranges. I am definitely starting to get hungry. 9:16 PM: Our break ends. We turn our attention to the syllabus, slowly discussing the poems we will be reading and the structure of the class, before turning our attention to the specific work required for us. I am still considering whether to take this class or 21L.486, but I am not exactly certain. In the meantime, I continue to collect quotes from the professor: “Read this to your grandmother when she dies…I mean, when she retires.” “I am trying to chew a cookie and look intelligent at the same time, but this is a nearly impossible combination, so I’m going for the cookie.” “The COOP doesn’t love you and it doesn’t love books.” 10:06 PM: Class ends. I check in with the professor about the pre-req for the class, since I’ve taken many writing classes before, but none in literature. He says: “Wait for a minute. The next time the topic comes up, lie to me.” I nod solemnly and begin the walk home, along with my two fellow Nexties. 10:27 PM: We arrive back in 4W main lounge, after taking the Tech Shuttle and picking up some packages at desk. I get my Mystery Hunt pin and a book I’m reading for my thesis,  . I finally eat dinner, which consists of a cup of instant ramen, and I play the Heardle with my roommate while it soaks in the hot water. I watch my friend’s  world record speedrun 11:48 PM: I take another break from writing this post. I wrap up some small tasks I have to finish by tomorrow, including printing the piano accompaniment for my 21M.405 audition tomorrow, which involves two trips down to
 
the Athena cluster: ⁠ 16 a room where MIT used to have computers for shared usage, but which now mostly just holds our printers. 12:10 AM: I send a text tentatively agreeing to pick up the commitment from earlier in the afternoon, given some additional stipulations, and although I might regret it, I am still extremely excited about it. This, it seems, is why I am always busy—I never quite know when to say ‘no.’ Maybe one day I’ll grow out of it. I prepare my to-do list for tomorrow, and call it a day. Just one more thing left to do: finish this blog post. two years later 12:51 AM: I finally finish writing everything up, and schedule this post for noon.

It finally happened. I got Covid. Right at the last week of  
IAP ⁠ 01 Independent Activities Period, which runs throughout most of January I feel a lot better compared to the first few days of Covid, but because I’m still feeling weak, I’m gonna just write this post on the spot and then schedule it to get published right after. I usually spend a significant time editing these posts, but I wanna go lie down and watch more Hermitcraft after this, so yeah. This is pretty much the equivalent of posting the rough draft. I had a close contact with someone on Sunday who tested positive for Covid a few days after. The Saturday night before that, I had went with my friends to Harvard and ran into two freshmen, and we ended up chatting with them until like midnight. My brain is filled with too much snot right now to remember what we talked about, but I remember there’s a whole debate over there about whether El Jefe’s Taqueria or Felipe’s Taqueria is better. Anyway, I was really tired by Sunday, so my immune system had already taken a hit by the time I was exposed to Covid. Monday was fine. Tuesday was mostly fine, but I developed a slight headache and a sore throat towards the end of the day. I found out about the close contact I met on Sunday. I told my roommate  Fatima I got a positive test on Wednesday. Woke up with a raging headache, and my throat was burning. Had slight bodyache, chills, nausea, all of that juicy virus stuff. I was mega bummed out. Fatima and I had been taking a swim class together over IAP so we could complete our  
swim requirement, ⁠ 02 MIT undergraduates have to fulfill a swim requirement by either passing the MIT Swim Test, or taking a swim class After we reached out to Covid support systems on campus, Fatima was able to find a place to stay in Tang Hall, a grad residence right next to Next House. I felt really bad. Kicking my roommate out a week before the semester starts is not a vibe. Wednesday wasn’t the worst day, though. Thursday and Friday were hell. It was bad and gross and sweaty. Covid obviously wreaked havoc on my physical state, but I didn’t expect it to make me into a hot emotional mess. My emotional threshold was so low that I cried over some of the dumbest things. Like caterpillars, because of how fragile they are. And I usually think caterpillars are kind of gross. I watched so much Hermitcraft over the past few days. It’s a series that I started watching way back in my senior year of high school, but I got behind on Season 9 during this past fall semester. It was great to finally catch up on everything that’s been happening. On the worst days of Covid, I literally woke up watching Hermitcraft and went to sleep watching Hermitcraft. In between, I finally watched  . Loved the art and loved the story. I didn’t expect such an accurate portrayal of anxiety in an animated movie about a talking cat. I also listened to a bunch of musicals, something that I haven’t done in a while. Stuff like  and  mood After the hell combo that was Thursday and Friday, I started feeling a little better. Changing up medication helped. But I could also now walk to the restroom without feeling like I was going to faint in the middle of the hallway. Which is great. My appetite was also coming back again, slowly but surely. But every so often, I’d get these nasty coughing fits that would last whole minutes. Sunday started off rough because the fire alarm went off at Next House early in the morning. I was weak, distressed, and very pissed off. The rest of the day was fine, though. I definitely felt much better than I have in the past few days. I still feel pretty crummy because the semester’s about to start, and it looks like I’m going to have to take off at least one day of classes. I also have to finish up a

Or more like, my imagination of what Scotland might look like.”  So I posted a picture of Paterson Falls flanked by lush, pseudo-Scottish foliage and location tagged it “Scotland, UK.” With the exception of another friend actually from New Jersey, people ate that up. I received many a DM along the lines of, “woah since when were you in Europe?!” I rode the high of my “European” adventure for a few more days, location tagging more pictures of random New Jersey foliage as the British countryside. I eventually came clean with an apology video that could give James Charles a run for his money. When

A place that included the town with the super

real green grass. ⁠ 05 this is nontrivial to me because i grew up in drought stricken California, where all the green grass was fake and only yellow grass was real grass Thankfully we had pre-departure meetings organized by Stephen, the MISTI-UK coordinator, to teach us a bit more about Wales’s geopolitics. Wales is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom, the other three being England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The UK is the fully sovereign state that holds membership in the United Nations, but each country has separate national football teams that compete internationally.  Stephen’s hot take was that if each country put aside their pride to form a UK team, they might’ve stood a fighting chance at the World Cup. The Welsh are indeed proud of their Welshness. It would be blasphemous to call a Welsh entity English, but using the umbrella term British would be generally fine.  A Very Brief Overview of the UK Education System  Across the UK, children attend primary school through Years 1-6 (ages 5-11), and then secondary school from Years 7-11 (ages 11-16). Note that Years in the UK are offset from grades in the US by one; so Year 9 students would be the same age as 8th graders.  Students have some choice for their final two years of mandatory education. One option is taking vocational job training courses, usually offered by an institution called a college. If a student is planning on pursuing post-secondary education (i.e university), they would instead attend what’s called Sixth Form, take 3-4 A Level courses across both years, and take a final exam administered by an outside exam board. Here, “college” and “university” are not interchangeable. I got a few confused looks when I started talking about my “college” experience at MIT.  Preservation of the Welsh language is heavily emphasized in Welsh schools, bolstered by a recently implemented initiative called
 
Cymraeg 2050. ⁠ 06 'one million Welsh speakers by 2050' A Herd of Robots For two out of the three weeks I spent in Wales, I taught a group of thirteen Year 9 students how to make robot cars! I was heavily inspired by the line following robot competition in
 
2.678, ⁠ 07 Electronics for Mechanical Systems 
2.007. ⁠ 08 Design & Manufacturing I, aka the robotics competition class With guidance from my 2.678 & 2.007 profs, I identified ahead of time 3 main constraints for my envisioned project:  I needed to scale things down. These 13-14 year olds would not have the same math/physics background as an MIT student preparing to take 2.678/2.007.  I needed to work within the limitations of the secondary school’s resources and budget. A secondary school in the Welsh countryside, albeit a relatively well resourced one, wasn’t going to be anywhere as well equipped as  MIT’s plethora of machine shops and makerspaces. I would be the only teacher with a technical background instructing the group of 13 kids. I ended up having a substitute teacher in the room during most days, which helped immensely with classroom management, but didn’t help much when ten kids all had different issues with Solidworks at the same time.  When I was planning out my curriculum during winter break, I mostly thought about constraints 1 & 2. I made slides and worksheets, prepared starter CAD files and skeleton code, and packed a suitcase full of electronic parts and hand tools (including 100 mini screwdrivers). For constraint 3, I considered having kids pair up to make my life easier, but my desire for every student to bring their own robot home (and disregard for my future self) ultimately won over.  fun fact my beloved pair of red pliers got confiscated at the Heathrow Airport bc I forgot to take it out of my carryon :( As things tend to go in school settings, I was gifted many last minute surprises. I had prepared my CAD lessons using Fusion360 with the assumption that the students could download it themselves. The morning of my first day, I learned students couldn’t download anything onto the school computers, but at least the school already had Solidworks licenses. I had never used Solidworks before. Okay, I could just speed learn it before I had to teach it. But the computer lab was in use for two other lessons, then locked afterwards. I finally found someone with a key 20 minutes before my lesson and just barely started fumbling with Solidworks before the kids trickled in.  Okay, I could speed learn Solidworks  while  I’m teaching it. That was a stupid idea. I had a classroom full of kids complaining about why their “robot parts wouldn’t mate”, but I didn’t know how to
 
mate robots ⁠ 09 The 'mate' operation in Solidworks aligns two separate parts. In my classroom, 'mating robots' became synonymous to CAD. The kids were totally valid in being frustrated and honestly handled it well for their age. In retrospect, the sheer panic from this very rocky start made me perceive things as more catastrophic than reality. To put us all out of the misery of mating robot parts, I jumped to a circuits lesson intended for a future date. Not ideal, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do. I stayed after school to learn Solidworks properly and successfully taught everyone how to mate robot parts the next morning. The rest of the two weeks went a lot smoother (with the exception of the fact that the school
 
deactivated their computers’ USB ports, ⁠ 10 so that students wouldn't plug in their own USB sticks and play games downloaded on them :p 
“something, literally anything.” ⁠ 11 My original plan was to do a line following competition, but that would've been pretty much impossible if students couldn't upload their own code. Following a line requires a lot of trial and error in calibrating the sensors correctly and finding suitable parameters for the feedback control algorithm. Cultural exchange with Welsh Gen Z’ers In order to win over my students, I capitalized the fact that I was young and hip enough to understand their latest pop culture obsessions. Apparently, American media has such a large influence on British children that they’ve started saying fries for chips and chips for crisps, much to their parents’ chagrin. Here were the top four frequently asked questions:  Thanks to the rise of Target content on Tiktok, British children are immensely curious about the American sociocultural phenomena that is Target. I enjoyed  this video essay by Tiffany Ferguson Both students and teachers alike wanted my take on Meghan Markle. There’s something to be said about her getting unfairly targeted by the press because she’s both American and Black. Beyond that I haven’t given much (if any) thought to Meghan Markle though, and I don’t think the average American is super concerned about British royalty affairs either. I will happily let this occupy my mind though:  Even more than the Year 9’s, the Year 3-6 students that I taught the subsequent week were absolutely obsessed with American Youtubers. “I ran into Jenna Marbles at a Safeway once.” Lukewarm smiles. The underwhelming response was understandable; Jenna Marbles was a bit too old for these kids. “ZHC was a senior at my high school when I was a freshman (but phrased in more British terms).” The class exploded. Every single one of these kids at least knew of ZHC, and many were dedicated fans. I got the impression that to these kids, I was the next best thing to an American Youtuber that they’ve met. They were  very  well behaved and engaged for the rest of the lesson. Not Amazon Prime apparently, but rather Prime the energy drink by KSI and Jake Paul. No I have not. I’ve never heard of this Prime drink because I am a boomer. Apparently this stuff is worth going to Asda (British supermarket chain) at the crack of dawn.   Reflections on Teaching  While I’ve always held immense respect for my teachers knowing that it’s a difficult job, experiencing it for myself gave me a deeper understanding for how much it truly takes. It took a physical toll on me to teach from 8am-3pm every weekday and then go home only to prepare the next day’s lessons. Despite having most of my curriculum planned ahead of time, I often found myself rewriting lessons into the wee hours of the morning.  Despite all that, I was playing this teaching game on easy mode, as my class of students was handpicked by the school from the highest achieving Year 9’s. I didn’t have to deal with any severe behavioral issues that would be inevitable in any other classroom. I sometimes forgot that I was teaching these 13-14 year olds skills that I had only learned in the past year or so, as they took on the challenges so well. Even when they got visibly frustrated, they kept trying. Students who figured things out quicker were also happy to give others a hand.  There is also so much to being a teacher outside of teaching.  Many teachers discussed regularly helping students navigate issues outside of the classroom— even if their job titles didn’t say so, they were also counselors, social workers, and unpaid therapists. Not to mention navigating school bureaucracy, taking care of their own families, and fighting for a living wage (teachers across Britain went on strike shortly after I left).  I can see how it’s the little moments that keep teachers going. The excitement on my students’ faces when their robot moved for the first time. Hearing that a student wouldn’t stop telling his parents about how much he loved robotics and CAD and aspired to work on stuff like that as a future job. Being dubbed “Audrey the science lady” by the Year 3-6 students. Target and ZHC.  It was really the constant support given to me by the teacher communities at the schools that helped me find my footing, and soon after, joy in teaching. Every teacher who I had a meaningful interaction with made me feel so welcome here.  Every morning, Kate drove me to school along narrow roads that snaked through the Welsh countryside. We’d exchange news about the dire states of our respective countries.  Then Heather would help unlock the door to my classroom and offer me a cup of coffee, which I’d always accept with great enthusiasm. I’ve miraculously avoided caffeine dependence at MIT so far, so I did not anticipate teaching kids to be the cause of my downfall. I used to hate black coffee as well. Definitely not anymore.  Emily, my host teacher that had put in hours of organizing with the school administration to make the robot project happen, would check up on me between her own classes to make sure I’m doing okay. The British greet each other by asking “are you alright” in the same way Americans might ask “how are you,” and like “how are you” they don’t always expect a real response as to whether you’re actually alright. But Emily always did. She could always tell if a day had been a particularly long one and reassured me that I’m doing just fine as a teacher.  Every time I made a visit to fix up the school’s finicky 3D printer, the school technician Daz would have a nice conversation with me about anything — technology, education, cultural differences between the US/UK. Daz also made me toast a few times after school. I tried marmite (aka vegemite) for the first time. It wasn’t bad, but I wouldn’t voluntarily buy a jar from the store. So after that, he’d make me toast with just butter.  Finally, Kate would drive me back through the Welsh countryside to my homestay.   To wrap things up, enjoy these photos of the REAL Welsh countryside! I had posted a few of them when I took them, only to get inflammatory DMs questioning if I was actually in Wales. Lookin’ atchu, Kellen.   the view outside the primary school that i taught at! sheep pastures were right around the corner (and you could definitely smell it from the school parking lot). Emily and her boyfriend took me on a walk in the Snowdonia mountains over a weekend! welsh sheep really said gay rights 🌈 #GTL (Global Teaching Labs) #robots

Tetazoo has historically been friends with Blacker, a dorm at Caltech. So when mystery hunt rolled around this year and Caltech was flying over to stay with us, we decided to give them a warm welcome by trying to unsettle them as much as possible. While Urban Walcott urbanized with two strips of colored LEDs lining the hallway, a bunch of the hall frosh built a beautiful shrine with linkedin pictures of all of our visitors faces pinned to a corkboard after only two hours of professional stalking. I unfortunately didn’t help with most of these things (other than sourcing four very long ethernet cables for the lights from the loading docks), but I did fill the whiteboard with various drawings. I wanted something truly representative of Tetazoo and Blacker’s love for each other. Tim x Bucky But then I thought, maybe it’s missing something. What happened to the other colleges? There surely has to be some foil to show how deeply enamored we are with each other. So like a background character in a movie poster, Harvard was drawn weeping in the background. The Harvard mascot’s facial features bear an uncanny similarity to that of Lord Farquaad, so I may have taken some design inspiration from that. Since I didn’t want Harvard to be the only lonely third wheel, I added Stanford. I’m not quite sure what I was aiming for here. On the last day before Caltech left, as a parting gift, Winnie suggested we turn the drawing into a light up acrylic sign. And because Tetazoo is full of procrastinators, we only started at around 8:00pm. After rushing back from Chipotle, I speedran a more cleaned up digital rendering of the lineart. I sent it to Winnie, who was already at Metropolis and ready to vectorize it. By the time I slid open the door and was munching on the starbursts I snatched from the dispenser, she had already cut two palm-sized test pieces that overlapped to form the whole piece. We put in the 12x 24 piece of acrylic, and I watched the laser cutter for 40 minutes just in case it starts to burn down. Previous Next While Winnie was setting up the LED strips, I laser cut a plaque out of red acrylic to go on the base. We were so close to finishing. Previous Next “The group photo’s supposed to happen right now, do we wanna head back?” “They’ll be an hour late, we can finish what we have right now.” We went back to hall, but Winnie was right. It took an hour to get everyone packed into the lounge, and surprisingly, Tetazoo was not the one holding everyone up. The last few Blacker residents jogged down the hallway and into the frame of the picture. There were two people wearing harnesses on rope, around 5 people on each of the couches, probably more on the table, and Rose was hanging upside down on the ceiling pipes. We held up the unfinished furry lamp at the front like a trophy, and the camera clicked. I forgot exactly what people’s reactions were, but it was probably something like this: By this point, it was around 2am. I tapped out to finish some stuff for the next day, so Winnie finished the rest of the base herself. It came out beautifully. The next morning, we shoved it in a Caltech student’s suitcase just in time for their (probably agonizing) 8-hour flight back to California. finished, base and all That evening, someone texts the group chat, asking for the original lineart. I wasn’t sure what he was going to do with it, but I sent it over anyway. Just yesterday, he sent a photo of the art, forever painted on some wall on the other side of the country.

two years ago i watched  the midnight gospel , a tv show where the dialogue for each episode is taken from a series of real-life podcast interviews. in the third episode, darryl, the interviewee, is an ex-convict who spent his time in prison practicing spirituality and magic. when i first saw this show i thought this episode was mostly nonsense. darryl often says things like: “The reason that meditation is so important in magic is because whatever we fasten our attention on, that’s the direction our energy is going to flow in, so when you’re doing magic, you want to keep your mind as single-pointedly focused on whatever you’re trying to accomplish as possible.” it took me another viewing to realize that much of the episode’s dialogue remains true regardless of whether you believe in magic or not. for instance, at one point the characters discuss how oral traditions are a way of transferring spiritual energy from the speaker to the listener, but you could just as easily interpret the discussion as saying that oral traditions pass physical energy (via sound waves) from one brain to another: “When we’re talking about something being an oral tradition, we sort of live under this misunderstanding that that means it’s just a bunch of stories told, handed on. That’s not what this means. What an oral tradition is, it means the way this current of energy is passed from one person to another is through the voice.” the part of the episode that hit hardest for me was this one: “Most people spend their lives complaining about things they don’t like. So, you’re adding power to it. You’re giving it chi. We’re supposed to focus on what it is that we’re wanting to move towards instead of away from. You don’t have to lie when something is bad. You know, if you have a cold and someone says, ‘Are you sick?’ that doesn’t mean say, ‘No.’ It means say, ‘I’m getting better minute by minute.’” i don’t believe in chi, but i do believe that complaining about problems and being pessimistic about them can make them worse. sickness is a particularly relevant example because it’s one where your psyche can directly influence what symptoms you feel – for instance, i once had a case of food poisoning that spiraled out of control and resulted in a week of widespread nausea, largely because i kept  expecting  to throw up even though i never did. there are many other problems that can directly worsen because you’re pessimistic about them, like depression and social anxiety, and there are problems where the effect is indirect, like various kinds of doomerism i’ve been thinking more about the line  “We’re supposed to focus on what it is that we’re wanting to move towards instead of away from.”  some people (i believe this started with social scientists studying migration?) call these  push factors  – wanting to escape something – and  pull factors  – wanting to move towards something. for me the more natural framing is  negative energy  and  positive energy , so that’s what i’ll use for the rest of this post most of my life has been dominated by negative energy. for example, throughout middle school and high school i knew that i wanted friends, but i didn’t really have a sense of what kinds of friends i wanted or what i wanted to do with them; i was more focused on trying to avoid being alone than on trying to find people i liked. similarly, there was a period in college where i was focused on trying to find jobs that paid as highly as possible despite not actually having much i wanted to spend money on; i think my pursuit of wealth was more about fear of not having money than about actually wanting money for something. in general i think the pattern of someone wanting something without knowing what they like about it or they want to do with it is a pretty good indicator that they may be motivated by negative energy, and it’s something i see pretty often in other people – for instance, people wanting to be in a relationship despite not knowing what kind of partner they want, or wanting to found a startup despite not having any problem areas or causes in mind i used to think it didn’t matter what your thoughts were as long as they pushed you in the right directions, that it was fine to fuel yourself with toxic waste as long as you were able to compartmentalize it properly. i no longer believe this, largely because i think proper compartmentalization is impossible over long timescales. this makes sense from both a theoretical perspective – sandboxes don’t exist in the brain because memories and representations overlap heavily – and an empirical one – people seem to be bad at context switching and clearing their minds take my  previous post , for example. i’m pretty cynical by nature, so during high school and most of college i believed that people who worked in high-paying and uninteresting jobs did so because they cared more about money than everything else. at the same time, i was friends with a lot of these people, so i tried to wall off those beliefs and interact with my friends as normal people with normal values. i was actually pretty successful in doing this for… maybe three years? but by the end it was becoming increasingly untenable and i was having spillovers where i viewed everyone else in a similarly cynical manner. eventually i decided this simply wasn’t how i wanted to see the world so i began looking for alternate explanations, and that’s how i stumbled upon my current views – that people do care about things other than money, but often don’t have the mentorship or confidence to pursue them (one of my friends recently told me a story similar in spirit: they were trying out various martial arts classes to learn self-defense, and there was one particular style that was extremely effective. the only downside was that you were supposed to imagine other people attacking you over and over in visceral detail as part of the training; in theory you should be able to compartmentalize this and only think about attack threats in martial arts settings, but in practice this bleeds into your regular life too. my friend eventually decided they didn’t want to deal with thoughts of being attacked all the time, so they switched to a different martial arts style even though it was less effective) the point here isn’t to discuss whether one set of beliefs is more true than the other. i think they are both true, but one is much less harmful and more actionable, and that’s what i’m prioritizing right now

The instructor, Margery Resnick, taught us so much about Spanish literature, history, and organized extracurricular events like a flamenco workshop (ole!) and eating the best patatas bravas in Madrid :)  I was a bit scared taking the class at first since it was mostly seniors and I didn’t really know anyone, but it turned out to be so much fun! I also got to practice my Spanish with locals, my homestay senora (she was the sweetest), and my roommate Emily (who I made watch the Rosa de Guadalupe with me). We traveled to other cities like Barcelona and Sevilla which were beautiful and it was great being immersed in another culture. Hector C. B. ’23: Howdies, Héctor here.  Ok, so to begin with, I’m kind of a senior, so despite my history of taking too much over IAP, I wanted to focus on what really matters: math. Wait, I meant neuro. Wait no, I meant people, final answer. You’ll edit that later, right? That’s why when I originally signed up, I just signed up for my UROP, went home, and had a relaxing time. But then I saw an email for a really cool class, and was like: “1 class can’t hurt, right?” So I signed up. I then saw another email, and was like “Bet!” Then, I saw another one… Anyways, worry not, I’m only at 4 classes right now and a friend says it’s okay as long as I keep it below 5 😃😆.  Okay, so now that we have that non-sense out of the way, what have I been up to? 1) UROP!

From somersaults, to diving, to an impressive 5pi/3 split, I’m low key worried my stick figure has already outclassed me, but hey, all in the noble name of the AI takeover 😉 2) Class. *end here* 😅 3) Chillin’ TM. As mentioned, I’m kind of a senior and may leave MIT this year, which is wacky, so I’m trying to make sure I have a fun ending 😀. This being said, I consistently rank as an SSS tier introvert, so this has in part just been me figuring out that I can reach out to others too 👉👈 (*shudder*), and having fun.

As a result, I’ve been visiting quite a few picturesque bookshops, watching amazing plays(notable mentions include a production of Titus Andronicus at the Globe(if you have read Fatima’s previous blogs, you know by now that I am somewhat fond of Shakespeare), and an Agatha Christie play set in a courtroom), and drinking lots of tea-some of which I’ve brought back for Fatima to try! Although I do miss being on campus, it’s been wonderful to completely immerse myself in a subject outside of STEM for once, something that’s been a little hard to do within the MIT bubble.

The briefest context for who I am: Hello, I am Jonathan, a sophomore probably majoring in 6-1 and 7 who lives in Next House – my wing is either 3W or 4W, depending on who you ask. Among many things, I am fortunate to be friends with Fatima, one of the bloggers of all time, and I am also fortunate to have a somewhat interesting story to tell. Read ahead! Prologue There is absolutely no reason that I should be awake right now. In less than 3 hours, I am supposed to leave Next House for Kendall Square, to ride the T to South Station, to take a Concord Coach Line bus across state boundaries to Salem, New Hampshire, all to finally walk 34 miles back to where I started. I have been told that a good amount of sleep is critical for such adventures, but instead, I am stressing over the fact that I have not checked the checkboxes that probably should have been checked yesterday nor answered questions that probably should have been answered yesterday, such as: Do I know where to board the Concord Coach Line? How will the weather be on the walk? What should I pack? How will I survive? Long walks  – explicitly, not runs – have always been my thing, especially since last year. During my first-year fall semester, some friends and I walked to Salem, Massachusetts (17 miles), almost reached Plymouth, Massachusetts (around 35 miles for our route – we actually only got to Kingston before it became too dark), and completed the Boston Marathon route (26.2 miles). I am no athlete, but my primary motivation has always been to test my own physical limits, and it is always nice to spend some good time with friends and admire the many wonderful sights outside of Boston. And best of all, the walk inevitably results in a very good story. This long walk is very different. One, I do not have someone else to walk with. Alan Z. ’23 (another one of the bloggers of all time) dropped out last night because
 
Mystery Hunt went long. ⁠ 01 thank you teammate for writing impossible puzzles 02 I have now been recommended to wear boots with microspikes. 
a traveler on a winter’s night. ⁠ 03 thank you calvino Despite all of these bad reasons that would easily make this journey the most reckless series of events I have ever done, I have a few good reasons to go on the walk. I had already been planning something along these lines for the previous semester, but in standard MIT fashion, I ran out of time. IAP offered a good chance to take some time for myself, especially after dropping two classes. I was also looking to earn the bonus achievement of an interstate walk at some point, and New Hampshire is the easiest state to choose.
 04 In fact, I know someone who has completed this walk before but under much better springtime conditions. 05 To be clear, there were plenty of other options, including not going on this walk. I simply refuse to acknowledge them. I begin packing some necessary things: an extra long-sleeved shirt, an extra pair of pants, three granola bars, and hot water in a thermos. My roommate (Andy!) is still asleep, so I try my best to not wake him up. My alarm rings – thankfully, I fell asleep at some point looking up where exactly the South Station Bus Terminal is. As I take my earplugs out (necessary accessories when living in 3 deep), I am reminded that I am not the only one awake right now, though the people who are not really trying their best to speak softly are probably going on an opposite journey, the one where you go to sleep. I run through my mental checklist again – the one thing I seem to have forgotten was a paper copy of the route, which I print out to the first-floor printer. The question of what to wear is extremely important. Because increased flexibility and decreased weight makes the walk easier, the optimum is to wear the lightest amount of clothing that stops you from freezing. Luckily, I allotted just enough time to run one test experiment to approximate this optimum: my first setup was definitely insufficient, but with the wooliest socks I could find and an additional hoodie, I can feel nothing, which is the best feeling to have when the outside temperature is
 
-2°C. ⁠ 06 A recent conversation: 'We use Celsius because we’re real scientists.' 'Wouldn’t real scientists use Kelvin instead?' One day I will learn that my thumb is not meant to cover the lens. I finally find the South Station Bus Terminal: you have to walk along the train lines to some unassuming door on the right hand side, then go down one set of stairs, then climb another two sets of stairs, and finally, you find this random parking lot full of buses, one of which I board. I am one of the last ones to board (thankfully the warning of “first come first serve” did not affect me). The bus is filled with some people already asleep, some people who are drowsing to sleep, and some people who seem just as worried as I am (for what? I don’t know). The bus engine revs. We are about to leave, and I am about to fall asleep. Because Salem is not the last stop for the bus, I considered setting an alarm to wake myself up in case the bus would not stop for long. I did not set the alarm, probably because I had already fallen asleep by the time I would have concluded that setting an alarm would have been a good idea. The conductor thankfully yelled out right before we arrived, so I woke up anyways. The bus stop is not so much a stop as it is a random highway exit. As I deboard with a few others (most of the passengers are probably heading to Concord), I am greeted by the smell of gasoline and the sight of a perfectly white parking lot. The cars have all been here at least overnight – probably people who live around here take the bus down to Boston for some obligation, so they park their cars here during their stay – and some of the people who have deboarded have begun de-icing the windows of their cars. I take a few pictures, reveling in the fact that I have reached another state, though due to no work of my own. In just under 40 minutes, this bus has taken me from home to the middle of what seems to be nowhere, and over the rest of the day, I need to take myself back home. I take a deep breath: the game is about to begin. Previous Next If you would like, follow along with the original planning document  and the Google Maps route. 1. Denial I am now walking on the Salem Rail Trail, after having escaped
 
the town of Salem, ⁠ 07 what a game Previous Next The Salem Rail Trail has given way to the Methuen Rail Trail, where Methuen is the first new town that I encounter on the walk. At this point, I think I have passed by more dogs than people. Zigzagging dog tracks are everywhere, and every once in a while, a friendly stranger walks by with
 
one (or two (or three (or four))) ⁠ 08 that's not Scheme To be clear, I did (somewhat) train for this trip. Aside from the first-year walks, I have not walked any distance significantly greater than 10 miles, but every day, when I have the energy, I do try to focus and walk at a meaningful speed.
 
Four miles per hour ⁠ 09 Generally, we (as in Google Maps and I) take 3 miles per hour to be the resting walking pace. This does not bode well. But it is okay. I am 10% of the way there, and everything is still beautiful. Previous Next I have reached Lawrence. This town is the textbook definition of New England: the brick buildings that were once textile mills clash with the copy-paste, wooden, three-floor apartments. There are more frozen rivers with quaint bridges, which does help, though it all still feels pretty monotonous. Lawrence is more urban compared to Methuen or Salem, which means there is finally sidewalk. I thank everyone who has woken early to shovel snow off the sidewalks – my feet have not been having fun at all. Having taken zero anatomy classes, pseudo-anatomically, I outline my current theory for why walking on ice and snow has been so painful. Most of the joints that matter when walking, such as your ankles, knees, and hip joints, are ball and socket or hinge joints, which permit rotational motion. Ice and snow force you to find your best footing mainly through translational motion. Translational motion and rotational motion do not mesh. Previous Next Three separate signs have let me know that I have reached Andover. I am nearly at the first stop on the trip, denoted McDonald’s #1. Perhaps the most important lesson from previous walks is to know where you can find good, hot, calorie-rich food, and McDonald’s at least satisfies the last two conditions. In fact, McDonald’s likely beats all other establishments at
 
the calories per dollar metric. ⁠ 10 This is a very important metric to me, though sadly I could not use it in 8.033 (Relativity). It has begun to snow, and unfortunately the wind faces me. Snow is beautiful when fallen, but it really does bite you when it hits your face. Everything else is still okay – my pace is good (maybe even too good), and I am rapidly approaching the one-third mark. Previous Next 2. Anger Massachusetts Route 28 is the main artery of the journey. Most of it is a two-lane road without sidewalks, but at least it has generous margins beyond the leftmost and rightmost lanes. Once again, the salt trucks have done their job, so these lanes are perfectly clear and wonderful to walk on, or at least as wonderful as it can be at 11:11 AM at -1°C. The art of walking without sidewalks is something that I have been forced to learn. Some key tips (or personal opinions): try to walk on the left hand side so you are facing the drivers, who knows when you have to dodge; though it is a bit greedy space-wise, try to walk on asphalt instead of on dirt, mud, or snow, even if the road margins are not super wide – drivers are generally just nice to afford you enough space (read: barely not crash into you), and your feet will thank you later; and when you have to swap sides of the road for whatever reason, run as fast as you can (hey, that’s what Crossy Road taught me). It was shocking at first seeing how many people live on the side of Route 28. I pass by many people shoveling snow, and there are some children making giant snowmen many times their height. The thought of asking some random stranger to take a picture of me also came up, as the very nice coat I am wearing has turned all white due to the snow – I guess that image will only be saved in the brain. The houses have kind of blended into the background. I am sure they would be nicer without the snow, but for now, it is all white. Previous Next I forgot to take a picture in the first McDonald’s, a great sin. I ordered the classic two for $4 deal, which has a calorie per dollar efficiency around 170. Everyone else at the McDonald’s is drinking coffee – maybe I should do this at McDonald’s #3. I turn on my data for the first time on the walk and send a few texts to people to convince them that I am still alive. The Whole Foods at Andover is warm. I see produce at reasonable prices, at least compared to HMart. I see tomatoes that I briefly consider bringing back for
 
Fatima. ⁠ 11 Of course, I realize that she will then peel these tomatoes regardless of how she plans to eat them, which is one of the worst of tomato-related crimes. 
But I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, ⁠ 12 thank you frost The walk must go on. Previous Next Thank goodness something is new – I have reached North Reading, which is apparently pronounced identically to Redding, CA. The last hour has been the same three tasks on loop: (1) survive on the side of the road, hoping Ford F-150’s don’t hit me or drag up rocks that will hit me instead; (2) weather the cold, believing in the power of my decently warm outfit; and (3) take as many pictures as I reasonably can. I have been careful to not use my phone too much: the snowfall does not relent, and every time I bring out my phone to take a picture both the phone and the pocket that I shove it back into are getting wetter. The increasing rate of Google system alerts reminding me that “liquid or debris is stuck in the USB charging port” is concerning. The phone is not waterproof, and I do kind of need it. I should mention one of the key parts to planning long walks: designing outs. As they say, things can and will go wrong, and you always need a way to get to a safe location. This route had a few outs, thanks to the commuter rail at Andover and Reading and the T/bus stations past Medford. However, the highway provides no easy outs, and the gravity of being in a situation where one twisted ankle from one misstep could mean relying on the extreme generosity of a kind, not-going-to-murder-me driver to get home – I do not want to think about it. The snow continues to fall. Things are slowly becoming less pretty and more painful. But the walk must go on. Previous Next I thought that I would like North Reading and the cities in general because they sound safer, but walking-wise, the cities have proven to be more difficult. Normally, it is better to walk on the sidewalks than the road margins, but during the winter, the road margins have much less ice due to the generous salting. The salt trucks have come by so frequently that I have begun counting them as they pass by. The sidewalks in the cities only have patches of safe ground: maybe a charitable store owner threw out some salt last night, or maybe some hardworking souls have shoveled out sections; otherwise, the rest is all ice and snow. As McDonald’s #2 comes into view, I begin asking myself the overwhelming question: why did I choose to do this? There is always another day, there is always another route, and there is always another adventure. I am barely over halfway home, and though I think I will make it, will the journey have been worth it? But these thoughts are unproductive: I would rather think about the calories that I am about to consume. Previous Next I send a few messages of great importance to Vincent F. ’24, an Andover native. He is the only other person I know who would support the fact that most of the trip is planned to be fueled on McDonald’s calories. me: bro Andover is boring me: Nothing to do Vincent: Bro y tf r u there me: I was in Salem NH me: And i didn’t know how to get back Vincent: Isn’t it snowing today too me: yep Vincent: How did you get there Vincent: Don’t tell me you walked me: uh some bus or something Vincent: Ok good me: nah walking back though Vincent: No shot Vincent: U r gonna die me: I’m in north reading rn Vincent: wtf me: 54% way there Vincent: U madlad me: (heart react) 3. Bargaining I have just entered the heart of Reading, which is to say, I am about to enter McDonald’s #3. Not too much has been interesting between the two McDonald’s. The transition from the more rural outskirts into the main city has crept up on me. At some point, I looked back and saw nothing but snow, then I turned my head, and all the snow was either cleared or melted into the urban heat island. The snowfall has finally given up, which I somehow kind of miss. It forced me to stay alert, and chief amid my list of worries, I am beginning to fear that I will become too tired. More than ever before, I feel like I must take a longer rest at this McDonald’s – I hope that a good stretch will solve the leg pain, but who knows? The caffeine from the mocha frappe certainly helped make the last hour better, along with breathing tactics,
 
inventing new verses to Country Roads, ⁠ 13 I managed to remember all of the lyrics except the line 'West Virginia, Mountain Mama,' which feels like the third hardest line to forget. Previous Next What does Stoneham even mean? These are the questions that I ask myself about 20 miles in. I can see the sun falling towards the horizon, quite rapidly, but at least I am in a populated town for now. After Stoneham, there will be no more easy outs until Medford – at least one hour of potential danger in Middlesex Fells. On the other hand, my friends have only told me how beautiful the reservation is when they visited. Maybe it won’t be so bad. Previous Next 4. Depression This is the first of two times that I will walk off Route 28 after having first merged into it almost six hours ago. This is also the first of three times that I will cross Interstate 93, which feels very different now that I have walked by it. It is strange to think that soon car headlights will be the brightest thing around. I overshoot the Bear Hill Trail entrance by 0.5 miles, losing some time tracing back. Middlesex Fells is all white and barren, as predicted. I am sure that the trail is more populated during normal hours, but right now, it is only me and the trees. It is not yet dark, luckily, and the snow has such a high albedo that it might not be as dark as I thought. Into the woods! I am lost. This is one of the few times on the walk where I planned to rely on the GPS – I didn’t need a GPS to tell me how to walk on Route 28 for a dozen miles, for example. However, the GPS signal is so inaccurate that I could easily be on any of the three trails that had split up a few steps back; the westernmost trail promises to keep me for an extra mile compared to my planned route. There are colored tags on the trees, but who knows what they indicate? I consider tracing back to the start because even though it is becoming darker, and I am becoming more tired, I can always follow the freshest footprints in the snow, which are mine. Maybe the starting trail sign would mention which trail corresponded to which color? I don’t know. The faintest voice inside of me whispers a dangerous idea: I have brought more than enough to stay warm throughout the night; I do have an out after all. I begin walking much faster, despite every one of my two legs telling me not to, forging ahead in the general direction that I think is southeast. If I return to Route 28, I will feel a lot safer. I am no longer lost. It was not that bad, luckily – I probably went half a mile down a wrong trail, but I have reached a merge point with signs, and I am now following the Spot Pond Brook Historic Trail. Since the trails are not that clearly demarcated, especially with all the snow, I have been trusting the footprints ahead of me, which has worked well so far. The Spot Pond Brook, which I am now walking parallel to, resembles a skating rink, though I certainly wouldn’t want to test it now. It is almost beautiful. I am now on the portion of Route 28 that passes through Middlesex Fells. The road is significantly emptier than before, almost certainly because most of the cars merged onto Interstate 93. Speaking of Interstate 93, the sounds of honks and engines give me hope that home is near, though every step feels a bit more difficult. Previous Next I have been welcomed to Medford (without an entrance sign this time), and now am crossing Interstate 93 for the second time. The view from this bridge reminds me of those early morning hour traffic broadcasts; what I would give for it to be the early morning and not the early evening. It really is getting dark now, but at least there is only one more vehicle-dangerous portion. I need to somehow cross three lanes to the exit lane on Forest Street – not really sure how that is going to work. Previous Next The pain has reached my hip. For the last few blocks, I have been stopping at each corner to stretch, hoping this would somehow fix the problem, but everything feels so much worse than post-marathon or post-Plymouth, so I know it will not be that simple. I pass the Ball Square T Station. It is so tempting to spend the $2.40 and tap out, but some idiotic voice inside of me says to continue. I do not know what is going on with my hip, so I change plans: instead of going towards Café Mami, I will stop at the first restaurant on the way directly back home, saving one mile. The restaurant is called Oasis Brazilian Restaurant. I walk in and find a crowd of employees gathered around the cash register. I am out of breath, but I pull my two brain cells together to ask how ordering at the restaurant works – the waitress informs me that I have an option between a pay-by-weight option, an ordinary buffet option, and a buffet with barbeque option at increasing price points. Feeling optimistic that eating a good amount would provide me the energy to trudge through the final five miles, I pick the ordinary buffet option. On any other day, I would have found the food just okay, but in the moment, it tastes very good. The Brazilian equivalent of American Idol plays on five separate TVs, and I watch as diners come and go, with the exception of a Portuguese-speaking customer ordering drink after drink at the bar. It is nice, but as I read my phone messages, I am reminded that I am still not home. It’s just five miles, I say. Just five more miles. Previous Next I am sure that this has been the slowest mile – probably 24 minutes or so. If I keep this rate, I’ll reach Next House a bit after 7 PM; this is still earlier than Google Maps, but not good. I have been trying a new technique: on each exhalation, manifest that some of the pain will be exhaled as well. Is this what meditation is like? At this point, I don’t know, and I don’t care because all I can think about is when I will reach the end of this cursed street they call Main Street. There are no thoughts. I am now less than 1.5 miles from home, distance-wise equivalent to a normal trip to class and back, but they do not feel equivalent in any other way. I think back to this morning. At peak pace, I could probably arrive home at 18:50, but I must contend with the fact every muscle is telling me to stop.  What else can I do except go forward? You can tell how slow my reaction speed has become, because I saw the fallen Chipotle five paces back and only decided to take out my phone now. I wonder what the story is – clearly the Chipotle couldn’t have been thrown down because the lid is so far away, and would any sane pedestrian throw out Chipotle? Never have I been happier to see this slab of concrete. I am almost there, and I can almost swear that my hip is not going to fall off. Is TeaDo open? The doors to Next House have been opened, by me. I cannot remember the last time it took me 18 minutes to walk from the Stud to Next House. I was supposed to take a picture of the river as some sort of closing callback to the first picture, but I am not walking back outside again. Not tonight, probably not tomorrow, and maybe not for a good while.
 14 Narrator: All of these statements will turn out to be lies. He will end up walking four miles tomorrow. I am supposed to feel triumphant now, right? 5. Acceptance 4W has begun watching Mamma Mia (the movie) for the N-th time (see Alan’s blog post ). I can still recall the memory of me entering this lounge to play the music video of Austin Weber’s rendition of Mamma Mia (the song) in front of a group of 4W seniors that I barely knew at the time. I am glad that it has contributed to this. I sit in the back at a bad angle to watch the movie, but frankly, I know I couldn’t have concentrated on it anyways. It has truly dawned upon me how lucky I am to be here right now. To be clear, this was not that dangerous in the grand scheme of things, but certainly it could have been worse. Having just badly summarized the entire trip to both Mack, the night-time security guard, and a small group of 4W, I know I will have to explain what happened today many more times. Maybe I’ll create a coherent story by tomorrow,
 15 maybe I’ll even write a guest blog post In a Messenger chat with myself, I am listing what to fix for the next long walk. Although this may have been the most reckless thing I have done so far in my life, I know myself well enough to know that the title of most reckless will be passed onto another adventure, but at least I can make it more enjoyable. I am exhausted, but for whatever reason, I am still awake. Half of me is still amazed that I made it back, and the other half of me still wonders why I went on this walk in the first place. I still have not found a good way to summarize the walk. In many ways, it was a ten-and-a-half-hour movie that only I witnessed, a movie in which I could intricately map out every detail if someone wanted. But to paint a wide brush and describe it under some umbrella idea? I don’t know. What I do know – I have decided to go to lab tomorrow at 9:30 AM. So, good night to my intrusive thoughts, good night to Next House, and good night to all. Epilogue Most of the above was written after-the-fact between January 17th and January 25th in the form of retrospective diary entries. In these nine days, I have learned that the pain was mostly due to a strained and possibly torn hip flexor muscle, which has gradually healed. Life has moved on, with great appreciation and love to everyone who has helped me. The memory of the day is not so vivid anymore, but sometimes the walk is brought up in conversation, and the mental projector turns on, playing flashback after flashback. Was the walk a good experience? I still do not have a good answer. It was fun in the moment and at many moments, but it was not so fun at every other moment. From my understanding, my leg should be normal within another week, and I want to say that my endurance will be stronger than ever. The dozens of texts to myself and my one-page diary entry serve as evidence that surely the next walk will be better.
 16 I'm looking at you, Gloucester.

I spent my IAP in northern Wales through Global Teaching Labs, a teaching abroad program! All of my weekdays were spent teaching at local schools and nights preparing last minute lessons. I’ll hopefully write a separate blog about that soon.  Thankfully, I got weekends to hop on a bus or train to the destination of my choice. While there were about a dozen other MIT students in South Wales, I was the only MIT student in North Wales. Unfortunately getting to South Wales would be 8 hours roundtrip for me, so I wandered around British streets solo. It got a bit lonely towards the end of the month. But I did appreciate getting to see things at my own pace and liking. British seagulls and pigeons fascinate me; somehow their presence seems more imposing than their American counterparts. Maybe this is just me stereotyping British entities as “posh.” Seriously though, British people eat everything with both a fork and a knife (I only noticed this after getting called out for never using my knife at dinner) and don’t tell me that’s not posh. Anyways, I scribbled the following text on a scrap piece of paper while waiting for a massively delayed train back from a day trip in Liverpool. Then I painted a few scenes while killing time in London until my flight back to Boston. Text for accessibility:  I visited two hollowed out churches during my time in the UK:  One in Liverpool, bombed out during WWII (St. Luke’s Bombed Out Church).  The other in London, burned down during the Great London Fire (St. Dunstan in the East Church Garden).  I think there is a quiet resilience to letting vines and shrubs grow over your ribcage. Make peace with your skeletal remains by tending to it as a garden.  The Welsh word for children is “plant” (pronounced like “plang-nt”). I’m not a linguist, but I bet that some Welsh ancestor saw within children, people and communities altogether, the everlasting potential to bloom.  To bloom is to change. The Liverpool church garden may not function as a church anymore, but it’s still active as a community space, bringing people together through outdoor art, music and theater events. (there was a disco ball in the church wall!)  When your walls come tumbling down, you don’t have to rebuild them.  You can bloom into a garden instead.  #GTL (Global Teaching Labs)

I went home for about two weeks before IAP started. I went to all the food places, the aquarium, the coffee shop 5 billion times, and then I was back on a plane to Massachusetts for the beginning of IAP. People were always shocked I had to head back so early for what they presume is some form of a “month-long winter break”. And it isn’t   a winter break, but it is slightly different. It’s the Independent Activity Period. I could try (and likely be unsuccessful in) compiling a list of activities that go on over IAP, but there’s just far too many. I tried to write down what I am doing over IAP (see here), but the post just didn’t really encapsulate  , y’know? Like sure, I did   what I sought out to at the beginning of IAP, but there were far smaller mini activities that went on at the same time. Here’s a compilation of the ones I can remember.  ways, and I got to see what others write about in their amazing poems.

Being a blogger is a bit of a weird job. Your only task is to write about your life, which seems easy as pie, but everything you write is expressly intended to be published on the internet for thousands of people to see, which can make it kiiiinda stressful. We often get questions about what blogging is like, how the job works, and how it feels to be famous. Today I’m here to answer those questions! (Spoiler alert: we’re not really that famous.) The process of becoming a blogger starts, of course, with applying to the job. The application gets posted every year around the middle of summer. You have to answer a few short questions and write three sample blog posts. You find out if you’re accepted right before school starts (in my case, when I was packing to come to Orientation!) I’ve gone back and re-read the sample posts that I applied with a couple of times and I actually think they stand up better than my MIT application essays, but I guess that’s not saying much :P Some bloggers end up putting up their application posts as regular posts, but I just happened not to do that, so they will live out the rest of their lives only on my hard drive. During the school year, the two main commitments of the job are writing blogs (of course) and coming to blogger check-ins. We’re expected to write one blog every two weeks and check-ins are scheduled at that same frequency. We get paid for each post we write, according to the number of hours we spent writing it — for me, that’s usually two or three hours, but it’s definitely more for people who write longer posts. The check-ins are pretty chill and always have   snacks. We always spend at least part of the time just catching up, answering a silly icebreaker question, and roasting
 
someone ⁠ 01 Not always Petey. But, tbh, often Petey. In between meetings, we have a pretty active Slack! The Slack has some professional-ish channels that we use to ask for thoughts when we don’t want to wait until a meeting, or to get a second set of eyes on a tricky blog draft. It also has a lot of not-so-professional channels that we use for everything else: ask for advice on which classes to take, discuss MIT’s latest policy change, make terrible memes and photoshop Jeremy’s avatar to look more like Eminem. The level of activity in the Slack definitely fluctuates, which I think is also true for the level of community among bloggers in general. Some years, it feels more like a job, and some years, it feels more like a group of friends. It depends on who’s blogging at the time and what they want to get out of it, which I think is okay; we don’t all have to find community in the same place. One thing I think is really cool about the blogger community is that it draws people together who have a different kind of shared interest than many other spaces at MIT — we have very different majors, academic interests, and hobbies, which can make for really lively discussions. Besides actually writing the blogs, we also occasionally have the opportunity to work with Admissions on other projects, like being in student focus groups for new initiatives or helping out with CPW. I’ve enjoyed this part of the job and getting to meet more admissions officers and learn about what goes on behind the scenes! This isn’t just restricted to bloggers, though; there are other student jobs within Admissions and they have similar opportunities too. Blogging is definitely one of the most well-known of the Admissions jobs, if maybe not  most? The people who work on the Pi Day video, and who write and draw the communications to admitted students, also have a wide reach, but they also don’t have a picture of themselves next to every piece of work they do, which has to make them at least a little bit less recognizable than we are :P In general, it’s not like being  famous — plenty of applicants and current students have never even heard of the blogs, and I’m not signing autographs everywhere I go. But, there’s definitely a little bit of name recognition: sometimes when I introduce myself someone will go “OMG you’re the blogger!” It’s cool to hear that people read and enjoy my blogs, although also weird to suddenly realize that someone knows a  more about me than I know about them. We also get our fair share of emails, some really sweet and some less so (sorry, if what you want is to advertise your startup to me, unfortunately I am not going to post an ad for your startup on my blog). It makes my   month whenever I get an email from someone telling me that a blog I wrote resonated with them :) Overall, blogging is a job like any other: sometimes you feel like you’re doing great work, sometimes you really procrastinate and feel the guilt, sometimes you’re just having a good time goofing around with your co-workers. I’ve really enjoyed being a blogger for the past five years (yikes I’m old). There were many times when I was tearing my hair out trying to make a blog less boring, or struggling to find time to write, but in the end I feel really happy: happy that I have a record of my life at MIT that I can revisit and that other people can read and relate to, and happy that I have this community to shitpost with, laugh with (and at!), and support each other.

UROP stands for “ Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program ” and it’s exactly what it sounds like. Undergrads get to work with professors, PhD students, and grad students on their research projects during the semester and/or summer. You can even get paid for it, which is awesome. a basic rundown of the process in obtaining a UROP It’s a great opportunity that MIT offers to their undergrads. However, getting research faculty to notice you in the first place can be a daunting task. But it doesn’t have to be! Here’s some general tips and comments I have about UROP hunting that will hopefully make it seem less challenging. Note:  I’m not going to go into detail about  how  to go through the process, since there are resources out there that cover that. The UROP site has a page titled Tips for Finding a UROP , as well as a series of advice and resources  for those who aren’t sure where to get started. There’s also a good blog post by Anna H. ‘14 called How to get a UROP  that goes further into the different ways that you can get one, written from a student’s perspective. If you really don’t know where to start searching, the MIT Experimental Learning Exchange (ELx) portal  has a list of UROPs, MISTI programs, and other student opportunities that gets updated fairly frequently. You can filter through the options to search for the kind of program that you’re looking for. You don’t have to be “good enough” to do a UROP Different labs and research projects require different skill levels. There are  UROPs that are looking for a more advanced skill set, e.g. a project that requires you to be a junior and proficient in, like, five different programming languages. But, there are also faculty out there who understand that many undergrads who are searching for UROPs don’t have that sort of background, and are willing to help undergrads get the research experience and technical skills that they need. It takes more searching, and a bit of faith, but they   exist.  Besides, it doesn’t hurt to reach out to a lab that you’re interested in anyway, even if you’re worried that you’re not qualified enough for them. You never know whether they’ll actually take you in or not unless you try. Get your resume and unofficial transcript ready to send. People are definitely going to ask you for your resume, and some will ask you for your transcript. If you need help on your resume, the MIT  
CAPD ⁠ 01 Career Advising & Professional Development website Some research groups that are hiring undergrads might ask you to write a few extra sentences, such as answering a set of additional questions for them, so remember to include that. Don’t be too shy to say that you want a UROP. Research faculty are usually going through tons of emails every day, so distinguish your email from everything else by adding something about UROP interest in the subject line (unless they specify otherwise). Be straightforward about how you want to UROP with them, and why. The UROP website has a whole page about  approaching faculty , which includes  sample email templates  that you can work off of. REALLY important. Remember to keep track of  deadlines money, credit, or just volunteer Also remember: There’s still steps that you have to complete after a faculty member tells you that they’ll accept you for a UROP. You have to fill out a whole digital application on the official UROP website, and send it to the UROP office for approval. This is why it’s important to search for potential UROPs ahead of time, so that you won’t run out of time to get your application submitted and approved. If you’re reaching out to all these research faculty who you’ve never met before, don’t bet on getting lucky with a single email. It might take you three emails until you get a response back. Or seven. Or forty. And don’t be discouraged if you keep having to reach out to more people! Whether you’re sending out cold emails or talking to people face-to-face, these are good skills to learn that aren’t going to go to waste. Rejection is OK Getting rejected is not a reflection of a lack of potential. If you get rejected from one place because you don’t have the required skills, there’s probably going to be another UROP out there where you do meet the requirements. It’s not always a matter of how qualified you are either. You could be the perfect match for a lab, and they could still reject you for many reasons that are unrelated to your resume. Maybe they don’t have enough funds for that term, or there isn’t anyone around who has the time to look after an undergrad. Maybe they’re just not interested in undergrads at the moment. Whatever the case is, it’s not the end of the world. Don’t give up! If you’re reading this and you’re UROP hunting, best of luck! YOU CAN DO IT!!!

Like  media studies “applied humanities” TV, movies, books, magazines, video games, fanfiction—it might not seem like these have a lot in common with the Mystery Hunt, or puzzlehunts in general. In this post, I’ll go over some similarities between Mystery Hunt and these other forms of media, putting the   in Comparative Media Studies. I hope to convince you that the Hunt, like all puzzlehunts, can be studied and thought of in the same way we can do for poems and short stories. Hence the “fifty years” in the

That’s why I’ve written my previous Hunt recaps, and why this post is in the same series. Because this is a “Mystery Hunt recap”, it’ll have some spoilers for Mystery Hunt 2023, which I’ll mark as I go.

I love you all. In 1981, Brad Schaefer, PhD student, wrote the  I.A.P. Mystery Hunt 
writing the next year’s Hunt. ⁠ 03 We'll take a closer look at this tradition, and its merits and flaws, later in the article. Ofishal Mystery Hunt 1984 Clue Sheet Its early names included  The Great IAP Mystery Hunt 3-Day IAP Mystery Hunt The Three-Day Puzzle Hunt early-installment weirdness It’s in 1992, a decade after the first Hunt, when the event first becomes more familiar. The name “Mystery Hunt” stuck. It started on a Friday, and the Hunt’s started on Friday since. It’s also in 1992 that the Hunt got its first theme: a  treasure hunt on Captain Red Herring’s Mystery Island excuse plot Theming stuck, and each Hunt since has had some sort of theme. Themes grew a little in scope: the  1997 Hunt 
decoy theme, ⁠ 04 It could be called a cover theme or a fake-out theme, but many Hunts since have had one, like how the <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2020/">2020 Hunt</a> started off with a wedding, when it was about an amusement park. 1999 Hunt 
plot points, ⁠ 05 In early Hunts, the plot had two points: the introduction, where you're given the puzzles, and the ending, when you solve the last puzzle. This was the first Hunt with points between: you had puzzles, the dossiers, that advanced the plot before the endgame. 2003 Hunt Then the Hunt became bigger in a different dimension. It became more popular, like the  2007 Hunt This American Life 2013 Hunt Wired 2011 Hunt an informal kickoff ceremony in Lobby 7 2014 Hunt Kresge Auditorium Several non-MIT puzzlehunt traditions started.

history of comic books, ⁠ 08 Most history information is taken from the "Comic Books" entry in the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. The medium has its origins in newspaper comic strips. In 1938, Detective Comics, now known as DC Comics, published Superman, which was a commercial success. A  1945 article Although I don’t have any good sources for comic book readership in the 1950s,  comic book sale numbers Consider  how comic books were printed trade paperbacks This brings us to the 2000s and 2010s. While printed comic books never returned to their former popularity, the superheroes who originated from these comics became popular even among the general public. The old X-Men, Spiderman, and Batman movies led to merchandise sales, and these days the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the  highest-grossing media franchises I think that puzzlehunt history and comic book history are similar in three big ways: 
and tech. ⁠ 09 I don’t talk about how the Hunt’s tech has gotten better over time in this post, but only because I’ve <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/two-hundred-puzzles-2/#the-copy-to-clipboard-button">written about it before</a>. teammate’s Hunt tech is stellar; they’re the team that first introduced the copy-to-clipboard feature discussed in the post I linked. These three arcs all trend in the same direction, which I’ll describe as  . Much like the question “are video games art?” we can ask “are comic books art?” or “are puzzlehunts art?” I’d call Mystery Hunt, as it is today, a work of art.

Puzzlehunts may not have gotten recognition from legitimatizing authorities yet, and I think it’ll be a while before a Hunt makes it to a museum. Its audience might yet be too niche to appear in mainstream media. But hey, this is a scholarly analysis of puzzlehunts, right? Mark Gottlieb wrote  his thesis Enough theory!

I woke up so demotivated that I didn’t watch kickoff in-person, in Kresge, even though it’d be my last chance to watch a Hunt kickoff before I graduate. I was so overwhelmed those first few hours of the Hunt that I had to take a break, and step out of the Hunt for a few hours. And it felt so bad that I put in lots of work making the Hunt run, yet I couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it. Then I felt guilty feeling tired. I’m not the person who’s done the most work for this Hunt, I’m not even   to that person. I probably spent no more than
 
an hour a week ⁠ 21 Averaged over a year. I spent way more time the weeks leading up to the Hunt, not as much the first half of 2022. I tried consoling myself. Like, if everyone thought the same way I did, wouldn’t no one allow themselves to feel tired? Or, maybe the work I did for Hunt was the final stroke, and I was having  a bad day , and it’s the only time a year I get to see many of my friends in-person, and I’m spending that time feeling sorry for myself rather than being with them. Woe is me, then!   I ask myself, and I answer,   do is hold a candle. The structure  depends on every brick When God sings with His creations, will a turtle not be part of the choir? Maybe the solution to the burnout is to remove the physical logistics entirely. Why can’t making a puzzlehunt only be about making puzzles? Here, I’ll argue that even if you removed all the logistics, puzzlehunts can   be “only about puzzles”. I’ll explain this in analogy to how movies are made. We can divide the Hunt into production and logistics. It’s the same with media, which can be divided into   and  . The media I have in mind are TV series and movies: these are the ones with the largest gap between development and distribution. In the book  Creative Industries  Even putting aside the economics of demand, it’s hard to

Think of indie movies acclaimed by critics that never become popular. There’s the conflict between making a product to sell and make money, and making  . Again, putting economics aside, this is a conflict I experience as a writer: I want to write blog posts, but I also only want to write when inspiration strikes me.  This is something that separates TV series and movies from novels or paintings.

Second, these are all matters of distribution, rather than development. If you only cared about making art for fun, without caring about its quality, none of these properties matter. If you want to distribute a good puzzlehunt to others, you have to deal with distribution problems, like   or  . If you want to run a Hunt in-person, you have to deal with logistics, like getting space and event registration. Either way, you need to reconcile writing puzzles with everything that isn’t writing puzzles. This is a problem for movies too. Jeff Ulin discusses this in Chapter 2 of  The Business of Media Distribution 
distribution and marketing ⁠ 25 The trope is called <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive meddling</a>, not distribution meddling. It’s meddling associated with studio heads rather than marketers. through market research Another way would be to cut the stages, and to vest all creative control with one person. This is what Pixar does, where executives  greenlight people, not projects benevolent dictators . This solves part of the problem. But writing a Hunt involves so many decisions that it’s impossible for the director to know  . Sometimes it’s impossible to put all decisions with one person. Consider how we divide Puzzle Club officers between   and   students. Most of us want to take part in the Hunt after it’s written, and so have to remain unaware of or unspoiled on its specifics. Spoiled students know more about puzzles and events, while unspoiled students know more about locations and logistics. In theory, we could have unspoiled members of Puzzle Club not help with running the Hunt at all. In practice, the logistics are too large for only the spoiled students to handle everything. A Hunt director has to be aware of this, and coordinate between spoiled and unspoiled students. Ulin argues that a good director closes the feedback loop between development and distribution. He gives the example of pitching  Higglytown Heroes theme song 
went well. ⁠ 26 My instinct is that "executive meddling" gets a bad rap due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>. When it goes badly, it’s on the news; when it goes well, how would we know? How does any of this apply to Mystery Hunt? If Netflix collects data on what its viewers want, then hunt writers can too. teammate did a great job of proactively requesting puzzle feedback this year, with a little chatbot in the corner asking for puzzle comments after each solve. The constraints of distribution can  breed creativity running remotely to its advantage Maybe the simplest way is to close the feedback loop between production and logistics. It meant a lot to me when
 
teammate ⁠ 27 Shoutout to Moor and Sophie, the people on teammate who directly worked with Puzzle Club the most. After the Hunt ended, Nathan opened a conversation about how ephemeral puzzles are. I talked about Nathan in my  2021 Hunt post 
after it ends. ⁠ 28 Once, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/angxvy/the_minnesota_afterthefact_mystery_hunt_solvers/">two people started the 2019 Hunt</a> and finished <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/c2pell/twoman_mystery_hunt_doomsday_town_unlocked_update/">six months later</a>. It’s an extreme example, but it shows that people work on archived puzzles. 
postsolve ⁠ 29 To <em>postsolve</em> is to solve a puzzle after its puzzlehunt has ended. It’s especially brutal for this year’s Hunt, as there are many puzzles that were solved by only one team, sometimes even   teams. These puzzles had people who spent hours writing it, testsolving it, rewriting it, postprodding it, and factchecking it, only for no one to look at it during the Hunt, maybe not even after the Hunt. This raises two questions. Why are puzzles so ephemeral in the first place, in the sense that few people postsolve them? And what do we, as puzzle writers, do about this fact? Nathan pointed out that these are questions all artists face. He quoted a segment from  Matthewmatosis’s Meta Microvideos Over time, the past gets more and more compressed, until only the most important points remain. You can think of every classic as a peak on a mountain; the tide keeps rising, drowning out all the lower peaks. As the water gets higher, the average distance between peaks just keeps getting wider. To the casual music listener, most of Mozart’s contemporaries, like Salieri, have drowned, and someday, he might, too. Maybe it’s inevitable that puzzles are ephemeral, because the human condition is ephemeral, and everything we do will disappear.  “Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” 
easy. ⁠ 30 Certainly not as easy as <a href="https://guzey.com/x/">playing a game</a>. Buddhist sand mandalas Maybe it doesn’t matter that your work is ephemeral, because you’re doing it for yourself. I’m reminded of Twitch streamers, some of whom  stream to no one gonna be playing anyway Board Games with Shrek For me, though, this isn’t strong enough of a reason to write puzzles. I relate to Anderson, also in Galactic, who said in another conversation that “all I want is for solvers to have fun, and that’s what still sustains me.” I felt so happy when I watched  Central Services solve my puzzle 
DD said, ⁠ 31 I give up introducing everyone. Assume when I mention someone's name without explanation, then they're someone who hunts with Galactic. All performing arts are ephemeral. Of these, I think the most like puzzlehunts is the theater. More so than music or dance, theater needs a motley crew of writers, directors, actors, designers, technicians, and managers. Theater is even more temporary than puzzlehunts, as it’s typically unrecorded. Being ephemeral is apparently so fundamental that Annie Dorsen called it one of theater’s three  “initial axioms” I’ve read several takes on this. Playwright Christopher Shinn once  did an interview I’ll forget them  a play. But sometimes I take (private) notes after deep conversations, because they’re so important I don’t want to forget them. Here’s another answer to the ephemerality question: theater professor Emma Smith argued that  forgetting is good, actually Steal Like an Artist nothing new under the sun you have good taste Maybe the answer to “how do theater people deal with ephemerality” is that they don’t. I read an essay by Eric Martin,  On Forgetting and Theater’s Impermanence We tell our parents, our friends, the guy we chatted with on Grindr,   […] The truth is I would love to create a live a performance that lasts forever, that is etched into cultural memory. […] I distrust anyone who says they make theatre because it is ephemeral. I suspect none of us   know why we make theatre. “It’s completely illogical if you sit down and think about it,” Nathan said, recalling what Jakob once said to him. “But you just kind of… have to not think about it.” Of Dorsen’s three  axioms of theater . It’s what’s meant by talking about an actor’s presence. If ephemerality is only possible by being in the same time, or being  , embodiment is only possible by being in the same space, being  . While embodiment also includes
 
how an actor uses their body, ⁠ 32 Which distinguishes theater from, say, a conversation or a lecture. Copresence is clear when you’re in-person, but can it happen digitally?

Your internet connection is unstable Zoom and copresence theoretical framework for Zoom fatigue 
doing it intentionally. ⁠ 33 All those times my parents told me to make eye contact, ugh. I think these arguments work for their respective media. But I think copresence   possible digitally, and a good example is Twitch. Why would  Just Chatting  with the streamer. I think Twitch achieves digital copresence by   trying to imitate physical presence, but by focusing on the feedback between viewer and streamer. Twitch emotes, chat hype, subscriber shoutouts—all ways to offer digital feedback. More than the feedback between viewer and streamer, there’s interaction among viewers themselves. I read an essay by Michael Beverley that cites this as  something Twitch streams have that theater doesn’t . It’s like watching a movie next to your friends and commenting on scenes as they come up, combined with the copresence of a play’s performers exchanging energy with the audience. During our conversation, Nathan said that puzzles might be more ephemeral than theater. “At least with theater, you have time to digest it and like discuss it over dinner,” he said. “With puzzles, I feel like it’s often ‘Well, on to the next one! Three more to go ’til the meta!’ ” Alan pointed out that this only happens because puzzles are done in the context of a puzzlehunt, and I agree. Most puzzles are exactly the same before and after the puzzlehunt ends, so why don’t more people postsolve? The answer has to lie in the difference between solving and postsolving. Indeed, Anderson mentioned the reward of unlocking more puzzles or progressing through a leaderboard. Mark mentioned that “you get to swap between, skip, and
 
backsolve ⁠ 34 To backsolve is to find a puzzle's answer by working on another puzzle. These are structural differences. I gave an overview of puzzlehunt structure in  my first Hunt recap There are more direct ways to encourage postsolving too. For example, the 2015 Hunt has an  online version archived version I think there’s another difference between solving and postsolving, one not captured by the puzzlehunt’s structure. Lillian brings up that “all art, no matter how physically enduring, creates an ephemeral experience.” I think this is the key to understanding why: it’s not the puzzles or puzzlehunts that are ephemeral, it’s the experience created by solving a puzzle in a puzzlehunt that is. For example, consider what Lilly shared during our conversation: One thing that struck me as really neat about this hunt that I hadn’t experienced before was the puzzle  Some Assembly Required Can this experience happen if Lilly, Abby, and Seth were solving it alone, after the Hunt ended? Maybe. But that’s assuming the three of them can find a time to gather, in-person, to work on it. When your friends have full-time jobs and are thousands of miles apart, that’s not easy. Rather than trying to fight this ephemerality, maybe we can embrace it. If our puzzlehunts are going to be ephemeral, we might as well make use of it by including copresence. I read a post from one of the  2014 Hunt A Mystery Hunt Design Philosophy Some of these don’t translate to an online puzzlehunt, but as we saw with the Twitch example, there’s several ways to  use digital copresence in a puzzle Projection Device but they still brought joy Interaction during a puzzlehunt isn’t restricted to within teams or between teams. I’ve discussed  the many ways solvers interact with the writing team puzzle submissions traditional scavenger hunt submit funny answers  for GPH 2020.) These are all reasons why puzzlehunts have to be an ephemeral  , with a defined beginning and end, or these interactions would be impossible. Let me talk about the 2023 Hunt. teammate had a great collection of puzzle highlights  during the wrap-up  for puzzle answers.) There’s the conventional stock of puzzles that involve walking around MIT. While these are a given for Hunt, it’s fantastic that they’re back again after two years of running the Hunt remotely, and the puzzle authors did an excellent job writing them. teammate also created a method of doing
 
story interactions, ⁠ 35 A small event that reveals something about the story to a team. I guess none of these directly address the issue of a puzzle getting zero solves. While I don’t want to belittle this situation, I want to offer Lilly’s story as consolation, which shows that a puzzle doesn’t need to be   for it to give a good experience. It’s unfortunate that these experiences are invisible to the authors. For all this, I’m speaking for myself, not for Puzzle Club or ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈. This is true for the whole post. But this is a topic fraught with emotions, so I want to be clear. I’m writing this not because I want to start a flamewar, but because I love the Hunt. Sandbagging is a term used in  racing cue sports grappling poker video games  is to underperform on purpose. While sandbagging can be done as a handicap against a weaker player, or to have fun in low-stakes games, it’s looked down on in competitive settings.

To be clear, it's not necessay for <em>anyone</em> to treat writing Hunt as a full-time job for it to be written. expectations can be high I think that sandbagging in the Mystery Hunt is contentious for many reasons: When I asked one of my CMS friends about this, he noted the similarity between writing a Hunt and

For concreteness, let’s consider  Twilight Legal reasons aside, maybe the reason is that fanfic is free because it started out that way. Consider  doujinshi Perhaps fanwork isn’t actually free, and the artist expects something in return. When I read essays written by artists about why they create fanwork, I read things like how it’s “art for art’s sake”, or they’re  “doing it for themselves.” Creative goods Never seen again apologize for not being active beta readers Let’s go back to the Greylight example.

Much has been written about fandom’s gift economy; just look at the Further Reading section of  Fanlore’s gift economy page The Fannish Potlatch Fan work Holding candles AO3 The case of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it benefitted from the gift economy, like how the community gave feedback with every chapter, and later how Twilight fans marketed the book through word-of-mouth. Yet Author E.L. James didn’t share her Fifty Shades profit with these contributors. Maybe that’s justified, because it’s hard to assign credit when there’s thousands of people leaving reviews and suggestions. What critics consider exploitative is how James didn’t
 ⁠ 40 I'm glad that puzzlehunts have a strong culture of assigning credit. I think the puzzlehunt community also works as a gift economy. People don’t get paid to write for Hunt, and puzzlehunts with registration fees are the exception, not the norm. I think both solvers and authors view puzzlehunts as a gift to the community; for example, in the  wrapup for Huntinality 2021 Some costs of running a Mystery Hunt can be covered by money. Space, physical puzzles, props, costumes, supplies, art commissions, servers. The Hunt  asks for donations Some costs of running puzzlehunts can’t covered by money. Time is the big one. Knowledge, either brought in from other fields, or learned from others in the community. This learning can happen through other puzzlehunts, through  articles discussion 
because I didn’t pay you anything. ⁠ 41 Amon points out another difference. Puzzlehunts, unlike, say, crowdfunded projects, usually don't promise anything beyond having a certain number of puzzles. I’d feel cheated if the Hunt authors spent thousands of dollars irresponsibly. I wouldn’t feel cheated if the Hunt authors spent hundreds of hours making a Hunt I didn’t like. I want the Mystery Hunt community, and the puzzlehunt community in general, to be a gift economy that values all kinds of work. I don’t want people to feel pressured to contribute, because I don’t want our community to have a barrier to entry. To receive the gift of puzzles is to work on them, to spend time with them, and to share this experience with friends. This, too, is participation, and  this, too, is valuable To the ones who wish to do more, I hope that you find contributions you enjoy doing. Whether it’s through writing puzzlehunts, running puzzlehunts, running events that aren’t puzzlehunts,
 
giving feedback, ⁠ 42 There’s much to be said about giving feedback, but here’s two quick points. First, <a href="https://synecdochic.livejournal.com/239518.html">“Cult of nice” vs. “cult of mean”, round 2847, fight</a>. Second, I think puzzlehunt runners are underappreciated; we should remember that many hunts are given to us for free. community spaces wikis A team that can win the Mystery Hunt is a team that has, in many, many ways, benefited from the community. If that team never wants to write a Hunt, I hope that they contribute some other way, but I wouldn’t feel cheated if they didn’t. The Mystery Hunt is difficult to analyze because there’s nothing quite like it. A large, central, yearly event, where most of the organizers change from year to year, with a community of thousands inspired to create similar events, most of which are freely available. It’s been an interesting task to look at the Hunt and the community from a zoomed out view, and it made me realize how special puzzlehunts are. One thing that surprised me about writing this post was how technical it all felt. In the same way I’d think about a math problem in the shower or while walking outside or before going to bed, I was thinking about these questions even when I wasn’t writing this post. I had all these notes on books and essays and blog posts, all these thoughts and ideas and questions gathered from conversations with friends, and it was up to me to put these pieces together. There are issues I wanted to talk about that I couldn’t find a way to analyze. Like, how does the Hunt remain similar year-to-year, despite so many people changing? Why is the Hunt so central to the puzzlehunt community, and can we expect it to remain like this? Why are the institutions supporting the Hunt so loose, is this a bad thing, and if so, how do we fix it? Will the puzzlehunt community continue to grow, and what happens when it gets bigger? Is it possible to pay puzzlehunt writers without compromising the community’s values? I don’t know. I wish I knew, I wish I understood! I don’t even fully understand the “answers” I offered in this post. It’s lowkey frustrating that I don’t even know how to approach these questions, like I would a question about math or code. I now more deeply respect for people working to answer similar questions. I know I don’t have any pictures in this post yet, so I’ll end with this Slack message that I sent in August 2020: I liked this year’s Hunt, we should have more.

In middle school, I repeatedly listened to Lupe Fiasco’s hit singles “The Show Goes On” and “Battle Scars”, so when I heard he was teaching at MIT this spring, I had to take his class. My friend Wenjun H. ’25 had the same idea. Near the end of last semester, we got brunch together at Cafe Luna, a nearby diner. We talked about Lupe’s course and came up with various ridiculous schemes to get in, since we were sure it would be oversubscribed. “I’ve written a few raps,” Wenjun said. “What about you?” “Get me out of Arizona/the only one who can save me is Rona,” I riffed, referencing Wenjun’s only current internship offer in Tempe, which he desperately wanted to avoid due to summer heat. He seemed impressed. “You came up with that on the spot? Well, you do get to rhyme things with your name.” Throughout winter break and IAP, Wenjun texted me, asking to check if Lupe was in his office. I went to the fourth floor of building 14 a few times, but he was never in. Yesterday, Wenjun sent me a series of texts:   I raced over and found Wenjun, Lupe, and another guy sitting in the office. The other person introduced himself as Ajay, the TA. Apparently he produced his own songs, but when I searched him up on Apple Music, there were dozens of results. “Which one are you?” I scrolled and scrolled. “Here, I’ve got it,” Ajay said, taking my phone. As Ajay found his profile for me, Lupe sighed. “This is what I was telling him. Branding is important. You need to come up with a rap name.” “My rap name is Flavius,” Wenjun offered. “No, it’s not,” Lupe said. “I want it to be Flavius.” “It’s not Flavius.” At some point during his office hours, Lupe asked us what kind of person  take his class. “People who don’t like to rap,” I said. “Why not?” “Because . . . there’s rapping in this class.” Being flip wasn’t going to help me get in, so I decided to give a better response. “Okay, how about people who struggle with being vulnerable. A lot of writing is about sharing something true to yourself, and rap is such an explosive medium that asks for so much rawness. It’s not easy to open up, so those who are guarded and not willing to share their inner life probably shouldn’t be in this class.” Wenjun replied to the question too, and then it was Ajay’s turn. He said, “NPCs.” Lupe seemed mystified. “What are NPCs?” “Non-playable characters, like in a video game,” I said. I’d seen the terminology floating around Twitter. I knew what Ajay was gesturing at. Ajay nodded. “Like people who don’t really think outside of the box. People who are just taking this class because Lupe is famous.” “People who just accept whatever is in front of them,” I added. I didn’t bring up any of my misgivings with the term NPC. from xkcd There are many obvious reasons why it is wrong to think of fellow humans as NPCs, but perhaps the most obvious of all is that nobody is actually an NPC. When I was three or four years old, I realized for the first time that  . Everyone I saw—my parents, my neighbors, other grocery store shoppers—went about every minute of life with observations, emotions, questions just like me. My astonishment was visceral: it felt like I had eaten something unexpectedly cold, and the numbing discomfort pressed its fingers into every inch of my body. Nobody is an NPC because everyone is playing themselves. But we could also argue that  is an NPC because we can never play anyone other than ourselves, anyway. Philosophy aside, it has always felt wrong to lean into the “NPC” terminology because it seems dehumanizing to reduce anybody to such a label. Okay, but maybe I’m taking things too literally. Fine. Let’s use NPC as shorthand for someone who is dull, who doesn’t aspire to do anything particularly ambitious or creative, who is happy just getting a stable job and living a comfortable life. But NPC-ness is a spectrum, not a binary, just as all the factors that contribute to one’s NPC-ness (risk tolerance, intellectual curiosity, self-awareness, etc.) exist upon a spectrum. In some intellectual, abstract discussion, the sort spun in a room full of overstuffed armchairs and yellowed books, I think everybody would agree with this. Humans are nuanced and multidimensional. But that’s reductive, too, to claim that because we can never  what exists inside of somebody else, that it is fruitless to judge them. Lupe needed some evaluative method to cut most students from his class, as it was vastly oversubscribed. And I certainly have been subjected to many painful conversations with people who clearly hadn’t invested much thought or awareness into the topic at hand. Usually, I don’t frame the discerning question as,  but rather as  What do they seek from their relationships, their career, their lives? What questions do they want to answer? What axioms do they accept? How much agency do they exert, and where are they exerting that agency? It feels like a less morally-prescriptive framework for evaluating whether or not I may be on the same wavelength as someone else. Lupe said he wouldn’t tell us if we’d gotten into the class or not, but he appreciated that we had visited his office. That was our cue to leave. In the elevator, Wenjun and I dissected the meeting, speculating on their opinions of us. “Hey, thanks for texting me,” I said. “Remember me when you become a famous rapper. Flavius Flav.” Wenjun was a math and computer science double major. He’d told me his dad still checked his grades, even though he was a sophomore in college. He texted me about his quant interviews and took six or seven classes a semester. In high school, he participated in contest math and competitive programming. It would be so easy to dismiss him as one of those sheltered nerds with strict Asian immigrant parents. An NPC. But he loved history, too: he had recently gone on a trip to explore Roman ruins, his MIT Kerberos was  , he was writing a novel about Alexander the Great. It wasn’t just that he appreciated the humanities. It was that he was curious about so much, and that made him very interesting. If I had rushed to judge him, would I have missed out on a potential friendship? How many possible connections have I squandered due to a hasty assumption? How many people have dismissed  as an NPC or otherwise not worth knowing? Maybe these relationships rely on curiosity. Genuine interest in learning about someone else, in updating one’s flawed beliefs. The ability to perceive truth without the conduit of ego. Curiosity, and courage:

I’m briefly emerging from hard work in the application mines to share with you some thoughts from MIT writing faculty on AI-assisted writing. You’ve probably seen some of the recent news about  GPT-3 ChatGPT For reasons that will soon become evident, I think most of this is at best overstated. However, it certainly does pose interesting questions for pedagogy, especially those who are focused on writing and teaching. So I was pleased to see that last week, the Comparative Media Studies/Writing (CMS/W) collected some  Advice and responses from faculty on ChatGPT and A.I.-assisted writing CMS.614: Critical Internet Studies Communication Requirement MIT Writing and Communication Center 
computational assessment  writing, ⁠ 01 Going back at least to when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Perelman">Les Perelman</a> was demonstrating how the SAT Writing Section could be gamed. First, Professors  Nick Montfort Ed Schiappa Advice Concerning the Increase in AI-Assisted Writing 
There has been a noticeable increase in student use of AI assistance for writing recently. Instructors have expressed concerns and have been seeking guidance on how to deal with systems such as GPT-3, which is the basis for the very recent ChatGPT. The following thoughts on this topic are advisory from the two of us: They have no official standing within even our department, and certainly not within the Institute. Nonetheless, we hope you find them useful. Newly available systems go well beyond grammar and style checking to produce nontrivial amounts of text. There are potentially positive uses of these systems; for instance, to stimulate thinking or to provide a variety of ideas about how to continue from which students may choose. In some cases, however, the generated text can be used without a great deal of critical thought to constitute almost all of a typical college essay. Our main four suggestions for those teaching a writing subject are as follows: * Explore these technologies yourself and read what has been written about them in peer-reviewed and other publications, 
* understand how these systems relate to your learning goals 
* construct your assignments to align with learning goals and the availability of these systems, and 
* include an explicit policy regarding AI/LLM assistance in your syllabus. 
LLMs (Large Language Models) such as those in the GPT series have many uses, for instance in machine translation and speech recognition, but their main implications for writing education have to do with natural language generation. A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words; ones that are “large” have been trained on massive corpora of texts. This allows the model to complete many sorts of sentences in cohesive, highly plausible ways that are sometimes semantically correct. An LLM can determine, for instance, that the most probable completion of the word sequence “World War I was triggered by” is “the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand” and can continue from there. While impressive in many ways, these models also have several limitations. We are not currently seeking to provide a detailed critique of LLMs, but advise that instructors read about the capabilities and limitations of AI and LLMs. To understand more about such systems, it is worth spending some time with those that are freely available. The one attracting the most attention is  ChatGPT. TextSynth Playground GPT-NeoX-20B. Without providing a full bibliography, there is considerable peer-reviewed literature on LLMs and their implications. We suggest  “GPT-3: What’s it good for?” “GPT-3: Its Nature, Scope, Limits, and Consequences” by Luciano Floridi & Massimo Chiriatti. “Collaborating With ChatGPT: Considering the Implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Journalism and Media Education,” The advisability of any technology or writing practice depends on context, including the pedagogical goals of each class. It may be that the use of a system like ChatGPT is not only acceptable to you but is integrated into the subject, and should be required. One of us taught a course dealing with digital media and writing last semester in which students were assigned to computer-generate a paper using such a freely-available LLM. Students were also assigned to reflect on their experience afterwards, briefly, in their own writing. The group discussed its process and insights in class, learning about the abilities and limitations of these models. The assignment also prompted students to think about human writing in new ways. There are, however, reasons to question the practice of AI and LLM text generation in college writing courses. First, if the use of such systems is not agreed upon and acknowledged, the practice is analogous to plagiarism. Students will be presenting writing as their own that they did not produce. To be sure, there are practices of ghost writing and of appropriation writing (including parody) which, despite their similarity to plagiarism, are considered acceptable in particular contexts. But in an educational context, when writing of this sort is not authorized or acknowledged, it does not advance learning goals and makes the evaluation of student achievement difficult or impossible. Second, and relatedly, current AI and LLM technologies provide assistance that is opaque. Even a grammar checker will explain the grammatical principle that is being violated. A writing instructor should offer much better explanatory help to a student. But current AI systems just provide a continuation of a prompt. Third, the Institute’s  Communication Requirement For these reasons, we suggest that you begin by considering what the objectives are for your subject. If you are aiming to help students critique digital media systems or understand the implications of new technologies for education, you may find the use of AI and LLMs not only acceptable but important. If your subject is Communication Intensive, however, an important goal for your course is to develop and enhance your students’ independent writing and speaking ability. For most CI subjects, therefore, the use of AI-assisted writing should be at best carefully considered. It is conceivable at some point that it will become standard procedure to teach most or all students how to write with AI assistance, but in our opinion, we have not reached that point.The cognitive and communicative skills taught in CI subjects require that students do their own writing, at least at the beginning of 2023. 
Assigning students to use AI and LLMs is more straightforward, so we focus on the practical steps that can be taken to minimize use when the use of these system does not align with learning goals. In general, the more detailed and specific a writing assignment, the better, as the prose generated by ChatGPT (for example) tends to be fairly generic and plain. Furthermore, instructors are encouraged to consult MIT’s writing and communication resources to seek specific advice as to how current assignments can be used while minimizing the opportunities for student use of AI assistance. These resources include  Writing, Rhetoric, and Professional Communication program, Writing & Communication Center, English Language Studies program Teaching + Learning Lab Other possible approaches include: • In-class writing assignments 
• Reaction papers that require a personalized response or discussion 
• Research papers requiring quotations and evidence from appropriate sources 
• Oral presentations based on notes rather than a script 
• Assignments requiring a response to current events, e.g., from the past week The last of these approaches is possible because LLMs are trained using a fixed corpus and there is a cutoff date for the inclusion of documents. Providing an Explicit Policy 
Announcing a policy clearly is important in every case. If your policy involves the prohibition of AI/LLM assistance, we suggest you have an honest and open conversation with students about it. It is appropriate to explain why AI assistance is counter to the pedagogical goals of the subject. Some instructors may want to go into more detail by exploring apps like ChatGPT in class and illustrating to students the relative strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated text. In any case: What this policy should be depends on the kinds and topics of writing in your subject. If you do not wish your students to use AI assisted writing technologies, you should state so explicitly in your syllabus. If the use of this assistance is allowable within bounds, or even required because students are studying these technologies, that should be stated as well. In the case of prohibition, you could simply state: “The use of AI software or apps to write or paraphrase text for your paper is not allowed.” Stronger wording could be: “The use of AI software or apps to write or paraphrase text for your paper constitutes plagiarism, as you did not author these words or ideas.” There are automated methods (such as Turnitin and GPTZero) that can search student papers for AI-generated text and indicate, according to their own models of language, how probable it is that some text was generated rather than human-written. We do not, however, know of any precedent for disciplinary measures (such as failing an assignment) being instituted based on probabilistic evidence from such automated methods. Conclusion 
The use of AI/LLM text generation is here to stay. Those of us involved in writing instruction will need to be thoughtful about how it impacts our pedagogy. We are confident that the Institute’s  Subcommittee on the Communication Requirement, Writing, Rhetoric, and Professional Communication program, Writing & Communication Center, English Language Studies program Second, Professor  Eric Klopfer Justin Reich Calculating the Future of Writing in the Face of AI When the AI text generation platform ChatGPT was released, it made a lot of people take notice of the potential impact of the coming wave of Large Language Models (and even  proclaim the end of the college essay There now exists a computing device which, when given open-ended queries similar to those typically offered by instructors, responds instantly and automatically with a range of plausibly correct results. A reliance on this device could deprive students of the opportunities to develop for themselves the foundational skills necessary for the human resolution of said queries. Or it could usher in a new era of human inquiry and expression assisted by technology. Or both. The humble calculator has been the perfect rehearsal for the challenges we face today. As calculators became cheap and ubiquitous, they threatened the teaching of rote mathematics ( Per Urlaub and Eva Dessein draw a similar comparison The first two tactics were largely unsuccessful, though they persist to some extent. Our challenge is to figure out where to preserve the best of older habits, while shifting to embrace new technologies for how, like calculators, they can augment human capacity in our disciplines. Writing instructors already have much experience with these challenges. Spellcheck software was banned in many classrooms because of its potential negative effects on student spelling. Today, a student who didn’t spellcheck their paper is labeled as careless. Wikipedia, research sources on the internet, and automated translation services (for our colleagues teaching writing in second languages) have all bedeviled writing instructors in recent years. We should be cautious about technological determinism; we should be cautious about the creeping belief that we simply have to accept and adapt to ChatGPT. Maybe ChatGPT is terrible in ways we don’t yet understand, and bans will prove to be a viable and important option. But the history of these recent aids to human cognitive and communication suggests that they are pretty helpful; the best of their contributions can be integrated into our writing practices, and the worst of their shortcuts can be mitigated by walling them off from targeted areas of our curriculum–by teaching bits and pieces here and there where ChatGPT and future tools are banned, like calculators are banned when students memorize math facts. If ChatGPT proves to be an outlier from this historical trend, by all means let’s ban it, but until then let’s proceed cautiously but open to possibilities. The proclamations of the end of the essay have come alongside both popular press such as in  The New York Times TIME “New Modes of Learning Enabled by AI Chatbots: Three Methods and Assignments” In terms of practical advice for instructors who rely on written papers as a form of assessment, the most important advice is to try some of these tools out yourself to see what they can and cannot do. After doing so you may decide that as they stand now, you should prohibit their use entirely. But you might instead choose to limit use to certain cases that would need to be documented. For example, you might allow students to generate ideas for an initial draft but not allow any prose generated by the models. There are several ways in which these tools could be used right away: * They can be used to help struggling writers who don’t know where to begin with their assignments. * They can be used as a thought partner by students as they bounce around ideas that can be further developed. * They can help students revise their ideas through reframing or restating their prose. The presence of disruptive technologies like ChatGPT should cause us to reflect on our learning goals, outcomes, and assessments, and determine whether we should change them in response, wall off the technology, or change the technology itself to better support our intended outcomes. We should not let our existing approaches remain simply because this is the way we have always done them. We should also not ruin what is great about writing in the name of preventing cheating. We could make students hand-write papers in class and lose the opportunity to think creatively and edit for clarity. Instead, we should double down on our goal of making sure that students become effective written and oral communicators both here at MIT and beyond. For better or worse, these technologies are part of the future of our world. We need to teach our students if it is appropriate to use them, and, if so, how and when to work alongside them effectively. In the 19th century, a group of secondary school educators believed urgently and fervently that sentence diagramming was an essential part of writing education. They fought tooth and nail in education journals, meetings, and curriculum materials to preserve their beloved practice. They were wrong. We’re fine without them. Maybe we will be fine without the short answer questions that call for the recounting of factual information, the sorts of homework questions where ChatGPT currently seems to do pretty well (though, just like our students, it sometimes makes up incorrect but plausible-sounding responses). Assuredly, we will need to think deeply about the new affordances of ChatGPT, and the kinds of thinking and writing we want students to do in the age of AI and change our teaching and assessment to serve them better. We will have to have the kinds of conversations and negotiations with students that we had upon the arrival of Wikipedia, other Internet research sources, grammar and spell checkers, and other aids to research and writing. They took up a good bit of class time upon their arrival, and then we settled into more efficient and productive stances. We will also need to think about whether these technologies cause us to define new outcomes and skills that we will need to find new ways to teach. At MIT, an institution which is at the forefront of AI and one that prides itself in both its teaching in the humanities and consideration of the human implications of technology, we should lead the way in studying and defining this path forward. Ultimately, Michael Pershan from his math classroom sends us writing teachers his good wishes: “If the lives of math teachers — who have a head start on this calculator business — are any example, it’ll change things slightly and give everyone something fun to fight about.” We look forward to the ensuing debates. I really appreciate both of these thoughtful, hype-free, helpful takes on the future of education and AI-assisted writing from some of MIT’s experts in the field, and wanted to share them on our blogs since I know they are on the minds of so many of our readers today.

Last semester, I met W.M. in one of my classes, 3.019 (Intro to Symbolic and Mathematical Computing). They didn’t speak much and expressed a few strong beliefs about
 
array indexing ⁠ 01 They believed it started at 1 instead of 0 
the best programming paradigm ⁠ 02 Functional programming, of course The professor adored W.M. because they were adept at juggling mathematical expressions and all things computational – I heard they could list the first million digits of pi with perfect accuracy every time! The other students, not so much, perhaps because they found W.M. rather… uncooperative at times. Ugh, why do they insist on using square brackets instead of round brackets like normal? Don’t even get me started on all the weird and obscure symbols they use when they’re too lazy to write out full words. Are we even using the same language? I can’t understand what they’re trying to say half the time! I stood somewhere in between – respectful of their supposed mathematical wizardry, yet sometimes frustrated by their machine-like aloofness. One day, I decided to test their reputation for myself. “Hey there,” I asked as I wrote out
 
a Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions and a linear potential ⁠ 03 A second-order differential equation describing a particle in a gravitational field I turned away for a moment, thinking it would surely take them at least a few minutes to write everything. When I turned back, the solution was there, neatly written out with a plot of the function as the cherry on top. I was in awe. I’d met many brilliant people at MIT before, but W.M. was on another level. Driven by curiosity, I started spending more time with them to learn from them and see what else they had up their sleeves. It took me a while to get used to all their quirks, but eventually, W.M. became a great friend. For one, they’re an excellent
 
pset ⁠ 04 Problem set Even outside of schoolwork, W.M. is fun to be around. They can translate text from seemingly any human language into English and then read the result in
 
a perfect Siri imitation ⁠ 05 Any voice, including the robotic ones! The more time I spend with W.M., the more I’m pleasantly surprised to discover exciting new things – both about them and the world. Being at MIT is all about learning from novel interactions and experiences, and W.M. is by far the smartest, coolest, and most pleasant programming language I’ve ever used.

This winter break, inspired by a chaotic night hiking trip
 
in fall, ⁠ 01 Josephine ‘24 and I led our group through the mist after nightfall, ekeing out spray-painted trail signs with our headlamp. We clambered over boulders until we found the peak, looked out over a wide and quiet mountain, and then realize we had to walk back. I had some daring plans to go hiking every other day, but I wound up getting sick and having family obligations, so I had three major hikes to speak of, plus one noteworthy run: river path 10 mile run The first day I got back, stiff from the plane, I hit the river path outside my house. The river in Tucson is dry, always has been, but it goes on for miles with no interruptions. The path is secluded from the road with its rush of cars. I’d forgotten how quiet the desert is.  I was just off the plane, and was still recovering sleep. I had music blasting. I imagine my head contained a lot of static. If this were a lifestyle blog I would note that I was wearing spandex with pockets (!!) from Big 5 Sporting Goods and also no sunscreen. Previous Next Catalina State Park (ft my mother) I believe this was a Christmas Eve hike. We’re Jewish, so Christmas for me typically means Chinese takeout and trying to go out but realizing everything is closed and all my friends are busy. My mom and I predicted the ‘everything is closed’ part and instead drove up to Cataline State Park, about
 
forty minutes ⁠ 02 one of the biggest changes in coming to Boston is how distant the city is from nature. In Tucson, no matter where you live, you are at most an hour from mountains. However, everyone else also predicted shops being closed and drove up to hike as well. We found a spot in the parking lot and wove through a mass of children gathered around glass cases on foldable tables. What were they looking at? We got closer. The glass cases held reptiles: snakes, small lizards, tarantulas, and even a
 
gila monster. ⁠ 03 a big venomous lizard. The G is pronounced like an H I absolutely love reptiles. In the desert they are ubiquitous; freezes are unpleasant for them but never long enough to wipe them out. When I run or bike in summers, there are lizards sunning themselves up and down the asphalt path. I’ve nearly run over rattlesnakes more times than I can count, their scaly bodies indistinguishable, at a distance, from long fallen sticks. Previous Next After that we started hiking. The trail wound upward. I asked my mom about her work, her projects; every time I return she has new names to tell me, people she met and their projects. She works in web3 space. I told her how I was exhausted from taking seven classes, but was nevertheless much happier and more grounded than I had been a year ago. How I’d found myself again — in the starlit streets of Copenhagen, in the heat of the forge, in coffee shops scattered from Denmark to Arizona. I was good.  I was also sick — I’d picked up something from the plane — and I could feel the urge to push through, keep hiking. I called for a stop about an hour in. We sat on the rocks and watched hikers pass by. A lot of them were parent and child pairs, too, talking about college or early careers. I drank water greedily; we’d brought more than enough.  “Okay, let’s keep going,” I said. I had started drafting a blog about self-care that same week. It occurred to me that I  could  go another hour, but I’d prolong being sick by at least a day. Finally I got myself to say, “Actually! Let’s go back.” Then I slept for all of Christmas day and felt mostly better. Previous Next Sabino Canyon (ft Maddie ’23) I joined forces with a friend from high school, Madeleine, who now goes to Smith. We drove out to Sabino Canyon, a popular paved hiking trail and one of the most likely ones around Tucson to contain water. There had been winter rains, and the water was high, pouring over several bridges. A tram which runs into the canyon couldn’t follow its usual circuit. Maddie and I got on the tram for a new and unusual circuit onto an overlook, and from there we took off and started hiking, vaguely following the river. We caught up on one another’s adventures as we forded the icy river and hiked into the canyon. I was struck by how many ups and downs she’s had; more recently, a lot of ups. She has a lovely repertoire of wild nights and stories to tell. I have been thinking about this a lot. My little sister went to a school that caps students at 4 classes for all eight semesters. Several of her stories began with “So it was Tuesday, and I was bored.” Tuesday was my all-nighter
 
day. ⁠ 04 though I guess, properly speaking, the all-nighter portion took place on Wednesday I don’t regret taking all the classes that I have, since I learned a lot, and I couldn’t double major with 4 classes each semester. It also seems to me that growth is partly a factor of experience, but partly a factor of time. Making the same chaotic choices several times in quick succession doesn’t necessarily guarantee learning more than you would from making that choice once.  I have experimented and grown during my time at MIT, and I like where I’m at. Even so, I want to experience more. I feel ready. I’m hopeful that pruning down my number of classes for the spring will give me more space to be wild and foolish. The river in Sabino Canyon was fast and cold and deep. We held our shoes and phones up high as we waded through, the water nibbling our stomachs and the small of our backs. But the sun, even in winter, is strong in Arizona. By the time we reached the parking lot, our clothes were dry. Previous Next Finger Rock Trail (ft my big sister) I ran up this trail once, years ago. It was faintly surreal: the trail itself faded from well-defined path to a series of cairns in untamed desert. Every now and then a white-haired man in sandals would appear on his way down from the peak and warn me it was difficult, and that I should turn back. I heeded none of these warnings. Eventually I reached the top, or near enough to it; climbing the finger itself requires ropes I didn’t have.  This time, I was with my oldest
 
sister, ⁠ 05 for anyone who’s keeping track, I am #3 of 4 sisters My sister and I talked about friendships and relationships. I liked hearing her vocabulary of needs and boundaries; it felt grounding. We swapped stories and little dramas, discussed our patterns of how we interact with people. My sister gives good advice. I want to be able to articulate people’s needs the way she does; I think I’m close, but I have more books to read.  After the hike, her boyfriend took Taquito and my sister and I went to Trader Joe’s. We grabbed food and munched it in the parking lot. The mountains before us were purple and grey. Previous Next After these hikes, I have decided to read  The Ethical Slut,  to spend more time with people, and also to destroy my body less. I’m hoping that my friends and I make more time to get out to the mountains this spring! Previous Next

This past month has been my first  IAP IAP is a weird time. A lot of people say IAP is one of MIT’s best offerings and the most pleasurable month of the academic calendar, but I don’t agree with either of those sentiments. I like to think IAP is a sort of purgatory in which you are your own god. You have choices. You can make IAP as much of a continuation of the fall as possible, or you can do nothing. Yet, most people do neither. They stay in purgatory and do some amalgamation of everything and nothing all at once. It is also worth nothing that Cambridge is a strange place to host a purgatory. I suppose I never fully realized how dominated the city is by MIT until a large fraction of those who make up campus are no longer physically present. One night in particular, I walked from Macgregor and into Central Square without seeing a single soul. Not one person. It is never like that in the fall. To make matters worse, I feel like purgatory should be tepid, but I am currently freezing. All it ever does is sleet and snow. All this to say, I have been doing   things.  prosody ToBI  I look at things that look like this: Once the class is through, I’ll likely write an entire piece about prosody, but I will leave you to parse through the poorly-developed Wikipedia pages I linked for now. During my time at MIT, I’ve discovered that I love linguistics in the same way a young child loves princesses or trucks. I am infatuated with it. I want to talk about it. This is fundamentally different than the way I feel about my major. I love my major in a way that is less obsessive and more fulfilling. I don’t want to talk about my major as much as I want to understand it in private. I can see myself settling down with my major across multiple decades, whereas I feel like I am in a sort of toxic relationship with linguistics. For example, I did a UROP in linguistics for an entire year, and I loved it, but by the end I felt like I was going insane. I’m going to minor in it anyways.  Each suite in MacGregor is equipped with a small kitchenette that cannot possibly adhere to modern fire safety rules but are pleasurable to cook in nonetheless. MIT gives eligible students $125 a week, which I affectionately refer to as Poor People Money (PPM), to spend on groceries at locations like H-Mart and Daily Table. So, once a week, I make the trek to Daily Table and buy as much as I can hold. Then, I cross the street and enter H-Mart, where I buy overpriced snacks and an absurd amount of Bok Choy. I adore Bok Choy. Then, I cook myself whatever meals I want.It has been a nice ritual, and I will miss not having PPM during the semester. Speaking of rituals, I am taking another PE class, since I forgot I need four to graduate and I’ve only taken one.  , which meets twice a week for an hour in Dupont. If you know me in real life, you know that I don’t seem like a very peaceful person, but I am making a concerted effort to be more still this year. It also feels nice to be doing an activity with other MIT students, even if they are strangers. I am also  , which I personally think is hilarious. Lifting is a   blogger thing to do. Cami is sort of famous for it, and I know Kathleen, Jeremy, and Petey lift too. [Edit: I forgot Amber   MG   Audrey!] To be honest, I don’t really care about being strong. I guess I just don’t value it in the same way most people who lift do. But I do like the mental feeling of lifting progressively heavier things. Alone in the Macgregor weights room on the verge of passing out, I feel sort of free. Maybe one day in the far future I will become strong as a byproduct. Finally,  Infinite Fashion Magazine , which is an organization I’ve been a part of since I first started at MIT. During my freshman year, I worked for other people’s spreads, but this year I am blessed to have my own with my very own design team. I don’t want to spoil it now, but  all the pieces are handmade by me That’s all for my purgatory. Have a somewhat heavenly or somewhat hellish IAP! (P.S. I am also officially in my   as of a few days ago, so be prepared for whiplash as I blog about Ella in a corporate setting for summer 2023…)

Even as a kid, school never fit right for me. I recall my third-grade teacher told us all to “divide your page in half.” The other students made horizontal or vertical slashes. Feeling rebellious, and wanting to amuse myself with the notion of “half”, I did a zig-zag that still partitioned the page into two equal areas. The teacher, who by this time of the school year was already familiar with my shenanigans, just sighed and said, “Rona, you can do that, but it might make things harder for you later.” (It turned out we had to make a pros and cons list with the two halves.) I’ve never been very good at school. This feels strange to admit online for several reasons: 1) I go to MIT and presumably had a good enough GPA in high school to be admitted into MIT (as well as some other selective universities); 2) It seems embarrassing to struggle academically; 3) I don’t think this naturally lends itself to some romantic corollary about  or any other idiom. For every famous college dropout who started a billion-dollar tech company or became a chart-topping rap star, there are hundreds of college dropouts who ended up with financially and emotionally worse outcomes than if they had simply gotten the grades and graduated with degrees. It’s not a particularly interesting struggle. It’s not a heartbreak immortalized in song lyrics, and it’s not a grief that demands witness through eulogies or obituaries. I don’t really know how to narrativize it, but I imagine many people reading this can understand this experience to some level: a missed deadline or three, frantic apology emails to professors, a mind that feels too much like a sieve. I saw a Tweet that says:  I’ve never really characterized my relationship with schooling as “unconventional” nor do I think of myself as an academic misfit, and I do fortunately have some material achievements, but I’ve started wondering if I’ve been squandering my own strengths by trying to pursue paths where my best qualities don’t get a chance to shine. I can Leetcode fine—it feels like a repeat of my competition math days—but I would prefer to build my own coding projects that might actually be useful to someone. I can go to lectures and do my homework and pass my classes, but at a university full of former valedictorians, all I can hope for is to put in my best effort and keep my eyes on my own paper. I like building things, I like making my own solutions. This past semester, several friends and I made a meme shirt, which riffed off the MIT logo. We advertised to the greater MIT student body, organized production and pick-up, and sold the shirts. It was so fun. It made me wonder,  ? But I don’t have a superbly high risk tolerance and the start-up world is so saturated and shouldn’t I use my college degree to get one of those well-paying jobs with good work-life balance . . . Even though I was categorized as Gifted and Talented as a child, I’ve never really identified with the “gifted-kid-to-burnout-pipeline” discourse. Maybe it was because I sensed, even as a kid, that the yardstick for “smart” is irrevocably entangled with yardsticks for “obedient”, “diligent”, “conscientious”, and many other traits that are very important but certainly should not be mistaken for “smart”. I am very lucky that, in fourth grade, my parents sacrificed their time and carpooled with other families to drive an hour into downtown Portland so I could attend an accelerated school, and probably this decision propelled me into higher-level math classes which eventually spurred me to study for contests that got me into college, but in retrospect, I don’t think the opportunities in that program actually emphasized my particular talents, nor did it address my weaknesses. Accelerated is just that—fast-paced coursework, material usually assigned to those a few years older. But my struggles at my old elementary school didn’t arise because I possessed a thirteen-year-old’s academic skill at age nine. They were more about how I wanted to draw a zig-zag while everybody else drew straight lines. Maybe this is all cope. Like, maybe I got a B in that one class because I’m just not that smart, not because I’m  , but also, I don’t think the underlying reasons really matter—my point is that I’m starting to believe that, instead of trying to bust my ass to get an A instead when the rigid expectations of school have never quite made sense to me, it’s more productive to lean into the activities where I can naturally succeed. here

I’ve been contemplating the future as of late. With just a semester of my undergraduate career left, it’s hard   to. Every second of my time seemingly is spent thinking of what will be and I’ve found it hard to stay present. I’ve been enjoying my time in Madrid, though, but have found that studying abroad has only complicated my feelings on what I want the future to look like. Had you asked me in my sophomore year of high school of what the future had in store, I would’ve told you something about graduating with a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins and pursuing animal prosthetics and biomedical devices at some grad school in the UK. Or I would’ve told you about living life as an engineer or veterinarian in London in my apartment for 1 and some incredulous number of dogs. That was before I met my second boyfriend and then things changed. From there, the future looked like Duke University, with him close by at App State or some UNC. It was biomedical engineering and dates by the lake and stone buildings. And when I got rejected from Duke, it transformed into semesterly visits to North Carolina from Boston, and vice versa. It was supposed to be late night Discord calls while carefully balancing my social life at MIT. It was meant to be four years of college with the end goal of hilly expanses and far too expensive apartments with the Golden Gate Bridge draped in the background. Our names inscribed into the Bay. But when we broke up, that future shattered into a million pieces and it became limitless. Untethered by the wants of anyone else except for myself. I imagined a life of biomedical devices, then a life of software, a life of grad school. I dreamed of Los Angeles beaches, of London fog, of New York City lights. Now that future that I’ve dreamed of is rapidly approaching, becoming more solid in form, more real. The image that forms my head is a little fuzzy, splashes of vivid colors here and there and buildings I don’t quite recognize, but want to know. Seeing without glasses. Raymond is in my life now, and I hope he continues
 
to stay here ⁠ 01 I hope forever, but things are always subject to change in this world. 
compromising. ⁠ 02 Which I've grown okay with. And of course he has to compromise, too. When I think of the future now, I see cushy New York apartments in the upper east side. I see a dog skittering up and down wooden floors and walks to Central Park. Biannual trips to Europe and hot chocolate under the light of the Eiffel Tower with Raymond by my side. Flights home to southern California and Christmases with family, incessantly asking about my life officially as an east coast NYC savant. But as I spend more time in Madrid, this image morphs into something else. I see late nights in a drunken stupor at
 
Teatro Kapital, ⁠ 03 Famous night club in Madrid. How do I know what’s right? How do I choose correctly? There’s so much left in my life I want to accomplish. I want to become fluent in Spanish, I want to write a novel, I want to get a PhD in media studies, I want to be closer to the entertainment industry and get invited to fancy movie and show premieres and meet celebrities, I want to get better at video editing and making, I want to learn how to cook properly, I want to become a veterinarian. And I get scared that I’ve wasted my opportunity at MIT to lead me down one of these proper paths. Did I do it right? Did I make the necessary series of choices to lead me down a path that maximizes my happiness? I’m finding it harder and harder to be more decisive, to commit to a single path. I wander in a sea of  s, a forest of  s, constantly wondering if the grass really   greener on the other side. Perhaps my reservations for commitment are indicative of a deeper issue, but we’ll save that for another blog. Regardless, I just want to be  . And that seems to be the thing that repeats in my head over and over again, a mantra that makes its way to the surface every time I make a decision or choice. Is this the way I can be happy? I may be making myself out to be more flighty than I actually am. I’ve gone through MIT without a fixed plan, bending to the will of whatever my whims ask for next, and it seems to have worked out. I have a strong belief that whichever path I choose will be a   path; it’s the waiting. It’s the wondering. It’s the worry regarding the unknown. Lately, though, these fears that originally arose from my Madrid trip have been quelled by it, too. As I’ve gone to visit so many different institutions and museums, I’ve come to meet so many people who have found their way back to Spain. I see myself in the people here. In the visiting scholars at the  . In the volunteers and workers at the  . In the students reading books under warm lights of lavish cafés. Upon arriving here, I had been convinced that this was a path I was giving up. By choosing the New York City lifestyle, I was sacrificing this one. But as time continued here, I realized that I was wrong. That there are ways in which I can do it all. That it’s okay to  it all. Cushy New York apartments, London cobbled streets, Madrid cafes and Parisian hot chocolate. Amsterdam studies and Philippine island sojourns. Fancy galas in warm LA sunsets in the congested streets of Hollywood. A life with my dogs, a life with Raymond, a life with children. White picket fences in suburbs that kiss the outskirts of citylines. Late nights of studying and practice surgeries and climbing the ladder. A grand return to Boston, this time older and wiser, to do it all over again. I don’t know where I’m going, but I hope wherever I walk, it’s somewhere good and somewhere beautiful. Somewhere where I can grow just as much as I did at MIT, where I can thrive like I did here. #musings on the future

cw: I discuss some injuries with varying amounts of needles and blood I learned some valuable life skills in Denmark, from how to turn on an induction stove to how to balance on a bicycle in unfavorable conditions, such as after a grocery shopping trip, a concert, or a Friday. One of the other skills I practiced was self-care. I learned to let myself rest when I was sick, let myself heal when I was injured, and to sleep after I ran myself and select members of the engineering department into the ground. I was going to write a blog about this, but then I took seven classes, got sick for a month, and pulled too many all-nighters to string together enough coherent sentences for much blogging.  Now it’s December, and I’m writing this at a healthy 11pm in my favorite late-night coffee shop. I’ve clearly learned these skills in a lasting and deep
 
manner. ⁠ 01 now it’s January, and I’m finishing up this blog in the best Mexican restaurant in my area of Sao Paulo In Denmark, my work was clear that when you’re sick, you stay home. It was summer, a slow period in countries where people get sizable vacations and take them. My absence wouldn’t hurt production. So, when in June I woke up feeling not my best, I drank hot coffee and biked to work. I shouldn’t have, but I wasn’t coughing or sneezing, so I told myself it was fine. Luckily, no one else got sick. However, ignoring illness and still exerting myself did not make anything better, and the next day I woke up with an intense fever. I crawled to my laptop, mentioned in the Teams chat that I was sick, and passed out on my futon. Growing up, I was used to dealing with injuries and illnesses the way you deal with bullies: ignore them, and perhaps they’ll go away. Maybe this comes from being called ‘tough’ as a kid. I didn’t often cry when I fell.  Maybe it comes from having busy parents and a lot of siblings. They taught us to bandage our cuts but  My family doesn’t go to doctors too often. When I was seven, I broke my arm at school, and we didn’t go to the emergency room until nightfall. When I was twelve, I had an infection that swelled for two days before we got it treated. I remember taking intravenous antibiotics. I may have been old enough that the doctors stopped calling me brave. In Denmark, I spent my sick day alternately sleeping and reading Neil Gaiman, with a brief excursion into the outside world to breathe fresh air. I took another day off that week, too, and felt good by the weekend. This was fortunate, since I was visiting MG in Berlin that weekend.  I wonder if I would have taken time off if I weren’t about to board a plane and see my friend. The time crunch told me I couldn’t do anything that would prolong a cold. Sleeping a lot and drinking hot tea was the responsible course of action. Of course, recovering before you re-enter society is always the responsible route, but I struggle to grasp that too much of the time. It’s funny. I have carpal tunnel, and compartmentalize pain every waking hour. Maybe that’s part of why flesh wounds don’t affect me. I know that they’ll heal. When pain is temporary, it is only physical. Anyway I don’t mind scars. entrance to outdoor market in Denmark Most days in Denmark I was up for anything. Swimming after work in the icy northern ocean? Yeah, let’s go. Go clubbing with co-workers in shifty bars where old men hand me free drinks? Of
 
course. ⁠ 02 one of the interns seemed shocked that I kept getting harassed The only time I slowed down was after I got a new tattoo. I read some articles on tattoo care, and the tl;dr was not to get too much sunlight or seawater on one. Normally I’d take that liberally, but for once I was conservative. The tattoo in question was a goat skull with desert flowers on my calf. I cut up a sock to cover it from the sun when I went running, every day for a week. I skipped ‘swim in the ocean day’ the day the tattoo got done, and afterwards I went home early from a party, too. The FOMO was real — everyone went to a salsa club which I never wound up visiting — but my tattoo is, to this day, not stretched from healing over a tense muscle.  Feeling myself take care of the tattoo was interesting. I knew tattoos are permanent, so whatever decisions I made for a week or so in Copenhagen would have long repercussions. I wasn’t doing much, just applying lotion twice a day and covering it from sun, but the internal commitment to care was new to me. Cut to this semester. I protect my hands but I wring the rest of my body through the grinder on the regular. Let’s skip the late nights — I didn’t manage to rest enough when I got sick, and I felt weak for much of October. Then I got this cool burn! [BE WARNED it is a little gory! Here there be dragons] this dragon. he is guilty. I was forge welding a dragon head. When forge welding, you heat up iron more than you usually would: not the 1000-1500 degrees C of red-hot metal, but ~2400 degrees of white-hot. I pulled it out sparkling aggressively. I’d left it in for a bit too long — the sparks should be more mild — but I thought nothing of this and hit the sparking, white-hot metal with the hammer. When metal is heated, it releases slag. Usually the slag is small and flaky and stays on the anvil. With this piece, however, a dime-sized piece of slag flew from the metal and into my boot, where it burned through the sock and sizzled on my skin. I gasped, set down the hammer, and used the hot metal to brace myself on the anvil as I took off my boot and sock. Yep , I thought,  that sure did burn through the skin.  It wasn’t bleeding, so I stuffed my foot back in my boot and turned back to the workpiece, which had gone from white hot to yellowish-orange, still hot enough to work. I picked up the hammer and smashed it several times before I added flux and stuck it back in the fire. Then I took the workpiece out again, hammered it down, added flux, and stuck it back in. Twice more, to make sure the forge weld was solid. Then I set the dragon on my anvil and limped over to the first aid kit. I wanted a band-aid. There weren’t any band-aids, so I closed this big case of burn cream and limped back to my workstation. I picked up the dragon head. The snout was too narrow to split into an open mouth, so I took it over to another smith to ask for advice. I hoped he hadn’t seen my taking-off-my-boot shenanigans. I thought it was kind of silly. look at him. how smug. his horns were thick and powerful but now after losing mass due to oxidation they are thin and scraggly. I found a band-aid in my room later that day and felt incredibly responsible. My burn was about the size of a dime. It was white, which I assumed was the layer of fat that lies between skin and muscle. That would make this a second degree burn. It was two weeks from my last final, which meant I had a lot of essays due, and then a lot of finals to study for, all in quick succession. I considered going to MIT Medical, but the last time I did that I was there for three hours. Besides, I knew how to deal with injuries. You put neosporin and band-aids on, and then ignore them and hope they go away. posting pictures of my cool burn is apparently a bad idea so here is the desert This burn, however, did not go away. It stayed there, an open wound.  I changed the bandage religiously after each shower, hoping that the next time I removed it, it would be smaller. No such luck. It stayed, white and liquid. Sometimes I exposed it to the open air, and it closed over, but only while it was in the open. Slap on a band-aid, and whatever scab had begun to form vanished, leaving the wound gaping. I didn’t see a doctor until break. They told me that I’d been caring for it the wrong way: the white stuff I thought was fat was in fact dead cells that prevented the wound from properly healing. When the doctor scraped the dead cells away, I saw muscle the color of uncooked steak and realized I in fact had a third degree burn. That is one degree more exciting! A cool story to tell. A big gory scar, if the thing ever heals. But it has to heal first. Since that doctor’s visit I’ve been intentional with care. I still run, but I’ve been checking on the burn’s healing progress instead of ignoring it.  Running myself into the ground goes with the territory; it’s what got me to where I am, and it’s what allows me to produce art despite the rush of work and school. I wouldn’t trade that work ethic. Nonetheless, I think this was a wake-up call to me to drop some responsibilities and be more in tune with my body.  Looking down the tunnel of three more semesters of MIT that are as full and sleepless as the three in-person ones I’ve had fills me with exhaustion. I never expected this to happen, but I want to try to carve out balance in the semesters as well as summers and IAP. I want to sleep more, set aside time to run and lift, and let myself be well. I think when this third-degree burn heals, I will put a tattoo around it. I’m not sure what it will be. And when I do, I’ll protect that tattoo from the sun. Update: once I started taking care of it, the burn healed in about three weeks. The scar is disappointingly not that gory any more.

a few weeks ago i had a job interview. we had some extra time at the end so i took the chance to ask my interviewer (let’s call them p) a few questions me:  what would you say is the primary source of joy in your life? is it your work or personal relationships or something else? p:  i would say there are three main components. you actually just mentioned two of them: one is people and another is creative work, like art or research. the third one is fulfilling obligations. they all contribute to my sense of meaning in different ways – social things help me feel a sense of connection, creative work helps me feel like i’ve expressed myself, and obligations make me feel like i have weight in the world, like i’m not unbearably light me:  interesting… i guess i asked that question because a lot of my friends in industries like big tech or finance openly admit to doing meaningless work, but they have good social lives, and they seem like they’re having a good time, so i’ve been wondering if maybe work simply isn’t important and having good personal relationships is enough p:  yeah, i think it’s common for these kinds of narratives to become very totalizing and for people to decide to only focus on one component. clearly that’s an oversimplification. the point is that my three components all fulfill me in different ways, and i need all three to be really happy me:  wow, i actually like this framework a lot p:  for what it’s worth, i also knew a lot of people from college who took the path you described, and i agree that they seem to be doing fine. but the question i would ask you is: do you think these people are  thriving ? me:  i don’t know. i don’t think they’re thriving, but i’m also not really sure what thriving looks like for them p:  yeah, i’d agree with that i spent the past week at hacklodge, a one-week program where ~20 college students live in a house and work on applied cryptography projects together. it’s somewhat difficult for me to pinpoint what i got out of the program – i learned a bit of new math but not a lot, and i don’t think i became a better developer because i worked on a relatively familiar stack. if i had to put it in words i’d say my biggest takeaway was a sense of freedom, a knowledge that if i want to, i can work on personal projects i care about (instead of a traditional academic or industry position) and things will probably turn out alright one of the mentors at hacklodge, let’s call him c, graduated from mit last year and is currently doing independent research on digital identities (the actual work is a bit hard to summarize, but i guess you could say the goal is to end up in a future where people have data ownership and anonymity instead of one where large internet platforms know everything about you). c and i talked a bit about how he lives reasonably comfortably off of grants, and how, even if he didn’t have those grants, people with the privilege of a) having gotten a math/cs degree from mit b) being us citizens c) not having family members or dependents to support can very feasibly fund themselves through a mix of gigs like tutoring and consulting and contracting c mentioned how a lot of this comes down to goodwill, and how, if you’re a smart young person working on problems that communities care about, there’s a lot of goodwill you can tap into as long as you’re willing to try to. as i talked to him i had the feeling that my mind was being unblocked, that there was another path appearing before me, one that had always existed but which i’d been too scared to take a serious look at until now i’m only now realizing it consciously, but when i look back at the last few years i can trace out a long line of people telling me not to get a job before hacklodge it was last fall, when half my friends bookmarked the article  quit your job : Even if you are rich and have no nominal boss, statistically speaking you are still effectively a wage slave. If all you end up doing is nursing the money, without ever exercising the authority to decide on which future it shall be spent, it might as well be someone else’s. People miss that escaping this meaningless servitude to our own capital was Thoreau’s main point in Walden. You don’t actually need the money; in reality, the money needs you to give it a worthy purpose, but everyone gets this backward. before that it was this past summer, when i spent many of my weekends hanging out with someone doing independent research in  data neutrality : Édouard Glissant’s Archipelago gives a glimpse into a “future [which] lies not with the great powers, but with the little islands, lands, and cities.” Not all research needs to happen within the monolithic institutions in academia or profit-hungry companies. Perhaps the next generation of innovation and discoveries that advance society will be made through small squads banding together to build things, live together, and create something more intricate, comprehensive, and wonderful than any one individual could have achieved on their own. “Benjamin Franklin had the Junto Club, Tolkien and C.S. Lewis had The Inklings, Jobs and Wozniak had Homebrew. The Bloomsbury Group was integral to the success of Virginia Woolf, Clive Bell, and John Maynard Keynes, while MIT’s Model Railroad Club spawned much of modern hacker culture.” – James Mulholland, Small Group is it foolish for individuals working together on passion projects to hope to compete with large institutions and corporations? i think the answer depends on the nature of the field in fields like agi development, progress scales very well with increased compute and budget, so you end up with scenarios like the current one where a few well-funded groups (openai, deepmind, etc.) make most of the progress and it’s very difficult for other individuals to make a difference. i think this property also holds in fields like drug development and particle physics, though i’m not as familiar with those subjects by contrast, fields like applied cryptography have the property that progress is almost independent of compute – having a large datacenter won’t help you come up with new protocols, and the world’s best supercomputers will struggle to invert hash functions or factor large numbers in the same way your personal computer does. this lack of asymmetry is why it’s possible for independent researchers to be as productive as researchers in established labs anyway, i don’t know if i’ll actually follow the advice of not getting a job, but at the very least i do feel more comfortable with taking on nontraditional and higher-variance roles now a year ago i knew very little about applied cryptography. however, i did have the privilege of knowing the founder of  0xparc , an applied crypto research group, so i was able to join 0xparc and get onboarded pretty quickly, and within a few months i was able to work on cutting-edge research. obviously i am extremely fortunate, and obviously this is extremely unfair in at least two ways on one hand, it’s unfair that organizations like 0xparc and hacklodge are so small, that people with genuine interest in the subject aren’t able to do good work because they don’t know the right people or don’t come from the right background. in a  previous post  i wrote about how an mit.nano class made me feel optimistic about climate change for the first time in my life, and it’s similarly unfair how only 25 people get to take that class each year, how more people can’t get access to that incredible feeling on the other hand, it’s unfair that these organizations and classes, which put people in a position where they can do productive work in the span of only a few weeks or months, don’t exist in most other fields. in an ideal world students interested in any subject would be able to join a group like 0xparc and try doing real research in a relatively streamlined manner, but unfortunately 0xparc is a massive anomaly we often dunk on college students, especially at schools like mit, for abandoning their intellectual interests and selling out to a lucrative industry position. what is often ignored in these discussions is that, in most cases, the person selling out never truly believed they could succeed to begin with, because they never had a chance to properly explore their original field and make real progress. it’s only natural for someone like that to convince themselves they’re unable to accomplish anything in their field of interest and to give up, and that to me is the greatest tragedy of modern universities we can’t prevent selloutism through motivational speeches about values and morals and making the world a better place; the solution has to come from people having real experiences with real alternatives, and even exceptional institutions like mit often fail in this regard, instead burying their students in an avalanche of homework and anxiety and recruiting we are born into a deeply nihilistic and pessimistic society, one where, from the moment we become conscious, we are bombarded by adults and news outlets and pop culture telling us that the world is falling apart and that life sucks after childhood. it is completely unreasonable to expect young people growing up in this environment to discover dreams and to have hope for the future, and then to preserve those hopes and dreams into their twenties with so little support a few months ago i  wrote “you wonder what could have been, how much good could have come about but never will, if young people at this school weren’t just left to their own devices to be swept up by peer pressure and marketing and insecurity, if they actually had the support they needed to make bold and principled and life-affirming decisions” . i wasn’t thinking very concretely when i wrote that and wasn’t really sure what i was writing about, but upon reflection that paragraph feels more true to me now on the last day of hacklodge, c and i listened to  self control  by frank ocean. we talked about one line in particular –  “wish I was there, wish we’d grown up on the same advice” . of course, in the context of the song that lyric is about relationships and breakups, but it’s also how i feel about young people growing up today. i know i’m extremely privileged to have had the experiences that have left me feeling so confident and optimistic and open, and i wish other people could have grown up with all these things as well — i wish we’d grown up with access to the same advice and resources and mentorship. i know that will never be the case, so i try my best to communicate my perspective by writing blog posts and being available for anyone to talk to, but it always feels terribly inadequate

Hola! Estoy en España porque estoy tomando una clase que se llama “The Spanish Incubator”. Para esta clase, vamos a Madrid por tres semanas y estudiamos sobre la literatura de España, con un enfoque en los escritores, los artistas y la cultura en general. He terminado mi primera semana en Madrid y he coleccionado muchas cosas diferentes como ticketes, facturas y más y quería compartirlos con vosotros. Quiero crear un video también, pero no tengo la tiempo para hacerlo. Ojalá después de que termine esta clase, pueda. Sin más preámbulos, estas son las cosas en mi bolsa después de mi primera semana en Madrid. (De izquiera a derecha) Tengo tres cosas del Prado, un museo muy famoso en Madrid. Este museo is tan hermoso y me encanta mucho. Lo recomiendo altamente y pienso que es un lugar esencial para visitar. Por lo general, no me creo ser una persona que puede apreciar el arte por completo, pero cuando estaba en El Prado, podía comprender su maravilla. Cuando llegué al Prado, supe que quería ver Las Pinturas Negras, una serie de obras murales de Francisco de Goya. No tengo fotos (desafortunadamente, El Prado no permite la fotografía) pero me conmovió inmensamente su trabajo. Además, este fue la primera vez que veía el arte de los artistas Filipinos. Planeo visitar El Prado otra vez antes de salir de Madrid. La transportación es sorprendentemente fácil de navigar. Compré esta tarjeta para viajar en los autobúses y el metro. Hice un cita previa con el consorcio transportes de Madrid para una tarjeta jóven, un
 
carné ⁠ 01 Okay I don't know why in Spain they refer to cards as carné instead of tarjeta for like bus passes and IDs and stuff... Fuimos a Toledo y visitamos el Museo del Greco. Me gusta el arte del Greco y su estilo mucho. Sus obras son muy sombríos y pensativos. Previous Next Tiene arte por todo la ciudad y es venerado como un grande. Esta es mi lugar favorito en Toledo. A pesar de no ser religiosa, me gusta mirar las catedrales y me sorpendió que creó La Catedral Primada en el siglo XV. El trabajo de mármol es intrincado y complejo y pienso que es mi catedral favorita (pero voy a visitar la Sagrada Familia y mi opinión probablemente cambiará). Este fue un viaje divertido. Había muchos instrumentos diferentes de tortura. No sé si fueran instrumentos fieles, pero no me importa porque me gustaba verlos y leer las descripciones. No voy a hablar de la clase porque pienso que mis viajes son más importantes. Fui a un bar con mis amigos la noche anterior y pedí un Tequila Sunrise. No sé mucho de los cocteles porque estoy intentando aprenderlos. Después del bar, fuimos a la Chocolatería San Ginés. Este es un lugar famoso para sus churros con chocolate, pero no me impresionó. Pensé que los churros de Barcelona eran mucho mejores. Previous Next Después de clase, tenemos un almuerzo con toda la clase. Había cuatro cursos. Intentamos pedir “scallops” porque el camarero dijo que había “escalope” en el menú…pero el escalope es un lomo de carne frito. Oops. Me gustaba la tarta de queso!! Mulan y yo dimos un paseo por Madrid esa noche. Miremos El Palacio Royal de Madrid y la Puerta de Alcalá (pero la puerta es en renovación así que había una “foto” de ella frente a la cosa real…) La clase y yo fuimos en un recorrido a pie, llevado por nuestra profesora y su marido. Vimos todos los sitios como la Plaza Mayor, El Retiro, El Palacio de Cristal, la Puerta del Sol, el Teatro Real y más. Fuimos a la Chocolatería San Ginés otra vez. Previous Next Mis amigos y yo viajamos a Toledo por el día. Nuestro tren salió a las nueve y regresamos a las nueve de la noche. Me encantaba Toledo. Al principio, no pensé que me gustaría, pero cuando visitabamos los edificios y las catedrales, cambié de opinión. Fuimos al Alcázar de Toledo, el Mueso del Greco, la Santa Iglesia Catedral Primada de Toledo, la Iglesia de Santo Tomé, y una sinagoga cuyo nombre no recuerdo. Previous Next Estaba muy cansada después de Toledo así que nos lo tomamos con calma. Tratamos de ir al Museo del Prado, pero es gratis los domingos y la cola era muy larga. Fuimos a Zara en lugar de eso y compré zapatos nuevos. Fuimos al Museo del Prado! Ve arriba! Una persona en nuestra clase mencionó un lugar de tacos muy famoso, así que todos fuimos después de clase. Estes tacos son los mejores tacos del mundo. Y tan baratos (cada taco cuesta uno euro)!!! Vimos también
 
El Gato en Botas ⁠ 02 This is a really good movie! Fun fact one of my family members (cousin? second cousin?) is co-director!) Previous Next Viajamos a Segovia por un día. No hay mucho que hacer sinceramente. Miramos los acueductos y una catedral y fuimos a un restaurante de tapas para cenar. Previous Next (Puedes mirar más fotos  en mi Instagram

I had expected to adopt  MIT terminology 
“UROP ⁠ 01 Undergraduate Research Opportunity. 
“7.012 lecture” ⁠ 02 it was a bit of a shock going home for winter break and remembering that nobody understood what i was talking about when i'd say “course 6” rather than “compsci” or “18.02” rather than “multivariable calculus.” I hadn’t expected the extent to which I ended up adopting my friend’s terminology into my own vocabulary. My friends’ and my vocabulary have become homogenized to the point where I can predict what they’ll say next because we talk literally exactly the same. On top of hearing variations (or combinations) of “slay,”
 
“so true,” ⁠ 03 see also: “so false.” can be used as a filler/form of agreement, or as an adjective, i.e. “so true of the professor for letting us use cheat sheets.”

PNR ⁠ 05 Pass/No Record, an MIT policy where, for your first semester of your freshman year, Cs and above are shown as a Pass on your transcripts, while Ds and Fs aren't shown at all. It’s hard to explain the grip that PNR has on me and my fellow frosh. In the aftermath of our last
 
(of many) ⁠ 06 for whatever reason, classes will oftentimes have multiple midterms per semester, leading to more than one wave of midterm weeks. how you can have multiple midterms when there's only one middle of the term, i could not tell you. 
IAP ⁠ 07 Independent Activities Period, aka the month in between winter break and spring semester in which students are free to visit home, go on vacations, do internships/UROPS, take fun classes, etc. without  classwork, I’ve been confronted with the reality that, come February, I won’t be able to just “oopsies” or laugh my way out of Cs on my tests anymore. The grindset mindset (a somewhat redundant name, I know), alternatively, is how I’ve come to categorize the genre of humor my friends and I shared around the middle of the semester. When my friend once claimed he could beat the school record for the 400m sprint if he woke up at 7am and trained every day for a month, we started saying that any trial or tribulation could be overcome if you’d “give me a month.” We’d offer consolations of “you can do it, you’re an academic weapon” or “push through, you have the indomitable human spirit” (straight from my friend’s frankly unhinged Tik Tok feed) whenever someone was in a slump. We’d overconfidently call our psets “light” or “slight work” before getting absolutely bodied by said psets. I guess the idea was that saying a “new pset just dropped” rather than dreading the impending deadline would trick our silly dopamine deprived brains into looking forward to the next time a pset would be released on Canvas. Looking back now, both mindsets were just coping mechanisms in their own way. In the beginning of the semester, I was more on the grindset mindset side of things. I attacked my coursework with the likely familiar attitude of someone determined to make this year their year, to get a jumpstart on the curriculum, to finally fix their less-than-stellar study practices. I started off the semester with a hellish schedule – 9:30am lectures Monday through Friday, with a nearly booked calendar until 5pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. I’d be late to
 
7.015 ⁠ 08 the Introductory Biology class that has a smaller class size and a larger emphasis on modern biology topics than 7.012. 
15.501 ⁠ 09 Corporate Financial Accounting. Despite this, for the first few weeks, I was kind of on top of things. I slept at a reasonable time. I actually went to recitations and (more or less; see below.) paid attention to my TA explaining the practice problems. I woke up at my first alarm and had time to make breakfast and admire the Boston skyline as I leisurely walked to my morning lecture alongside the Charles River.  my friend and i’s scribbles on a recitation worksheet, ft. 4.500-induced chair trauma Yet, what I didn’t realize at the time, was that I was already severely burnt out before the semester had even really started ramping up. I read somewhere that you should aim to have  seven commitments Admittedly, this might not sound like that much to high school me, who had a much more rigid class schedule and was the leader of three clubs and a varsity sports team. Having such a flexible schedule was and still is an adjustment; imposing discipline on yourself is the only way to really get anything done. Some days I use my free time well, getting sporadic bursts of productivity and chasing it until it’s gone; some days I can’t muster up the will to do anything other than soak in the presence of my friends; some days I just try to reset and do laundry and wash my hair and nap; some days I kind of just idle around my room and let time pass by without me noticing.  There was, of course, so much more to my semester than what was strictly outlined on my Google Calendar: parties and free food events and club outings and birthday celebrations and chill dorm hangouts and movie nights and late night meals and spontaneous T rides to Chinatown. Whenever I’m asked “how’s MIT?” I always say that I was constantly stressed but I didn’t have time to think about how stressed I was because I was having so much fun, and that’s exactly because these are the things I’ll remember looking back. But indulging in these things meant that, between socializing and schoolwork and sleep, something had to give. My schedule, as it stood, was simply unsustainable. so true I dropped 15.501 after the third lecture even though the professor was cool; the walk was too far and I felt too out of my depth with the content and I fell asleep in the front row of a lecture hall with only three rows. I dropped 7.015 after way too many weeks had passed; the small class size had made it hard for me to find friends to do the psets with and I hadn’t heeded the professor’s first-day warning that you should only take the class if you’re really interested in biology (which I am not). I started missing 18.02 recitations in favor of heading straight from my
 
4.500 ⁠ 10 Design Computation: Art, Objects and Space. 
4.021 ⁠ 11 Design Studio: How to Design. In the end, I passed all my classes, although probably with more uncomfortably slim of a margin than I should have. The nights leading up to my final projects and exams were stressful and sleepless, much more so than my counterparts who needed, like, a negative eight to pass their classes. Granted, I probably exaggerated my inability to get a 40 on my multivar final to some extent, but most of my panic stemmed from how acutely aware I was of the possibility of my laziness biting me in the ass. If I’d somehow managed to NR my classes because I didn’t end up watching the lecture recordings for the days I missed or because I waited until too late to start my project presentation, there’d be nobody I could blame but myself. Two years ago, on December 12th, 2020, I wrote an
 
ACT essay ⁠ 12 The general consensus now is that taking the ACT or SAT with writing is unnecessary, as most colleges don't take your writing score into account anymore. One year ago, on December 18th, 2021, I opened my MIT application portal to find an acceptance letter waiting for me. Amidst the excitement and relief and screaming and crying was a sense of trepidation. I was undoubtedly proud of myself, but an inkling of fear simmered underneath. Was I ready, in my current state of self? Would I be okay? A few weeks ago, on December 22nd, 2022, I turned in my last final and subsequently experienced my, loosely speaking, last day of PNR. In hindsight, I’ve changed in the five months since I’ve become a college student, while somehow not changing at all.  I already had poor study habits in middle and high school since I could usually maintain good grades with last minute cramming and essays submitted a minute before the Canvas deadline. This didn’t magically change once I became an MIT student. The me who waited until the add-drop deadline five weeks into the semester before realizing maybe taking 7.015 wasn’t right for me is, evidently, the same me who spent the winter break of my senior year playing on the class of 2026 MI(necraf)T server instead of working on supplemental essays for the other colleges I was applying to. But the me who played games instead of writing essays is also the same me who kept attending lectures long after syllabus week, when my friends started skipping; the same me who took notes while the people in the adjacent lecture hall seats watched Youtube or did their homework for other classes or dozed off. Growth is slow. I can’t say I was always proud of how I handled things, but in the wake of the struggles and frustrations and late nights I faced, I think I’ve come out with a mindset that’s the healthiest it’s ever been. Not quite the PNR mindset, not quite the grindset mindset, but something in between.  This may have been written in the few weeks following January first, but I’m not going to attempt to cram a year’s worth of self-improvement into a New Year’s resolution. PNR was good for my grades, but not particularly for my work ethic, and I’m prepared to remediate that, no matter how long it takes. So while, yes, PNR shall be missed in the coming semesters, I am ready, and I will be okay. #pnr

Bright by Echosmith. A week before I got into MIT early action, I was rejected as a QuestBridge finalist. My friend, was accepted. I was so happy for him, but I was also terrified. I worried that I wouldn’t get into   school. I spent that week solemnly completing what became a seventeen page application to my local  
university’s honors college. ⁠ 01 To be explicitly clear, the point of this line is not that it wasn't worth my time to apply to this university, but rather to emphasize how devastated I was by my rejection. I still cannot believe it was 2019 when I got accepted. What the heck I could tell the story of that morning– the story that I tell over and over again to anyone who will listen to it. But I’ve told that story before. What I want to talk about, is a tiny detail on the acceptance message: my name. See, I was accepted a few places, but MIT was one of the few who ( ) congratulated  . Not my  
deadname ⁠ 02 i.e. my previous name “, but Paige,
 
plain and simple. ⁠ 03 I mean, later that day I got an email from MIT with my deadname in it also congratulating me, but that's not the point. And just like that, I started to love the school I would one day attend. 
Because I could screenshot the acceptance and message it to friends and family  . MIT was one of the few places to do this for me. Later (in a silvery package) I received an official piece of paper that looked beautiful saying I had been accepted, though it had my deadname. So, in March 2020, I emailed Admissions and asked if I could one day get another piece of paper eventually that was corrected. One year later (due to covid), I finally got that piece of paper. I felt my younger, devastated, self take a sigh of relief. — I was slightly worried if things would change with name stuff once I got to MIT. Questions like “Would I be allowed to live at McCormick” (yes) and “What would my ID say” (Paige) occupied my mind. But really, for me the institute has been great in this regard. I hardly receive an email with my deadname– usually from financial aid or MIT medical; y’know, places that have to deal with my legal name. For the most part though, I’ve just been able to exist at MIT without needing to worry about this part of my identity. — Good question, hypothetical person asking it. Well, after nearly four years  
out ⁠ 04 i.e. existing as . (If you noticed my last initial on these blogs change from a D to a B, shhhhhh.) I’m excited to see how the institute reacts to this next. But if I had to guess, it would be just as accepting as it has been for the last 2.5 years. White Winter Hymnal (Fleet Foxes Cover) by Pentatonix Cambridge becomes this sort of, stark sterile  over IAP. Maybe it’s the tunnel vision of MIT during the fall/spring semesters, but the brightness is infectious. It leaks into empty classrooms and abandoned dorm rooms. It weirdly feels neither warm, nor cold. I usually associate Coldness with the  
darkness of the fall ⁠ 05 rip my vitamin D deficiency since at MIT It’s weirdly optimistic. Some people might think MIT becomes hollower over the Independent Activities Period. To some extent this is true– friends down my hall come and go with their individual holiday plans, and the  
stud ⁠ 06 student center . My friends seem more well-rested and are talking about things they’re interested in and excited about that don’t have to do with classes. The entirety of the first floor of Building 2 has become a Puzzle Hunt HQ. People are reading just to read, and existing just to exist. It seems as though people have been filled with the light and optimism of the bright white IAP skies. I know I have been. ##lookingonthebrightside #IAP

This is the fourth and last part of a series, consisting of a lightly-edited compilation of notes from my cross-country train trip from Boston to San Francisco. If you haven’t yet, you should start by reading  part one part two part three Hour 70: 7:50 AM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: just outside of Winnemuca, NV train: #5, one hour and 58 minutes late listening to: two people, one white, one Black, discussing race relations (nothing) Good morning! The inevitable has occurred; our train is now running two hours behind, although if the Amtrak schedule is to be believed, we may recover some of that time by Emeryville. The reasons for this delay are unknown to me, but I did remember waking up once and being stopped outside Elko, NV, and then waking up again with the train in the exact same place, without having moved, so it must have been something there. Despite the waking, my sleep was fairly restful; I had one particularly bad nightmare, but nothing much to complain about, and, surprisingly, my body has not developed any aches or pains over these 70 hours. All is well, out in the American West; we will just have to see whether I make my dinner plans. The landscape out here in Nevada is somewhat incredible, at least to me, in the sense that I have literally never seen anything like it. The prairie, smooth and rolling, juts up almost instantaneously into snow-capped mountains, shrouded with clouds. I suspect we will be going through those mountains soon enough. Other than that, no big updates. The train is slowly emptying, with more and more seats open in coach, and the lounge is not yet fully awake, I suspect. It is my last day here, and we will see what new surprises it brings. Hour 74: 11:57 AM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: between Reno, NV and Truckee, CA train: #5, two hours and 51 minutes late listening to: Do By Friday It has been an interesting few hours. We have lost even more time; apparently, the signals were out on the mud flats between Winnemuca and Reno, and so we proceeded at a crawling pace for a number of miles. Eventually, we picked our pace back up, arriving into Reno almost three hours late. This has truly become the tragedy that I expected all along; I simply did not expect the catastrophe to develop so quickly. Because of this, the journey will likely reach 80 hours; we will have to wait and see. I suspect that, regardless, my dinner plans may be a bit of a hopeless case. the aforementioned mud flats I did a little bit of reading for the first hour or two, slowly waking up, and then transitioned over to revising poetry once more. I continued to make good progress; honestly, even though I’ve only edited two or there poems a session, with a sufficient number of sessions, I’ve gotten through most of them, and I am surprised both at the ideas I have for revisions and the original quality of the poem, having gotten some emotional distance from most of them. We will see to what extent my thesis advisor agrees with me, but I am glad to have that as a souvenir of this trip regardless. The landscape got snowier and snowier as we got closer to Reno; I was impressed by the snow cover in Reno, as well as the sense that it was immediately at the foot of the mountains. My sense of the physical geography on this side of the country has never been particularly strong, and so the countryside has been full of surprises. As we left Reno, the mountains became steeper and rockier, covered with tall pine trees. Our route has been accompanied by the Truckee River, which bears the name of our next stop. It is just beautiful out here; the snow is pristine, the river is mighty, the trees are tall and proud. The mountains extend as far as the eyes can see, rocks peeking out beneath the snow, an occasional house here and there. I suspect that the next few hours may be just as much a wonder as the Rocky Mountains. Previous Next All of this, however, is not quite as important as my stop in Reno. I had told the bloggers that I was going on this trip, and Paolo A. ‘old told me that the route went through Reno! So, after the train’s many delays, the two of us met up on the platform briefly during the train’s designated “smoke break.” It was great to see a familiar face in an unfamiliar place on a long journey; we chatted for a while before it was time to get back underway. He also did me the great kindness of bringing me some In-N’-Out and some bread and cookies. I still do not understand the West Coast obsession with In-N-Out—as far as I am concerned, it is not particularly better than most of its competitors—but it was nice to be welcomed to the region in this way. The burger was fine and the fries were good. Paolo also got me a soda; I had asked for Sprite. They were out, so he panicked and forgot and told me to identify it when I sat down. It…just tasted like Sprite, with maybe a hint of ginger. Not sure what to say about that one. Previous Next And, in Washington D.C., lawmakers are making their best efforts to beat the arrival of my train in Emeryville. They’ll be back from adjournment around 10 PM EST, probably, which will be 7 PM PST. If that holds, I’ll beat them, but it’ll be close. Hour 76: 2:08 PM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: the Sierra Nevada, approaching Colfax, CA train: #5, three hours and one minute late listening to: Sammy Rae and the Friends, “ Good Life It has been a wonderful few hours. The contrasts between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, at least in the areas I have been awake to observe, is the vegetation and the rock formations. These hills are covered with what the train conductor informs us to be Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine; whatever they are, the do a good job of breaking up the scenery, such that you will be looking at trees for quite some time before, suddenly, there is a clearing and you can see off into the valleys. Previous Next I think the adjective which has most stuck in my head on this portion of the journey is pristine. So much of the path seems completely unsullied by human hands, apart from the rails beneath us and the railroad tunnels which occasionally interrupted our path. The snow is untouched, the mountains extend off into the fog without a hint of civilization, and everything seems quite unburdened by man. Previous Next This is not to say that there is no motion in the hills; as we go by, nature keeps her works. Wind and gravity disrupt the snow on a tree branch, sending it earthward; a river sneaks its way beneath the snow, causing tiny cave-ins above it. It is almost magical. Regardless of your beliefs about humanity, it is quite a profound experience. I have been watching the scenery go by while also finishing up edits on my poetry. I think that, once I get back to a real laptop, I will be able to compile all of these changes and have a reasonable draft of most of a thesis stuck together, which I am excited about. I can also turn my attention to other things which I have been putting off over the course of the trip now, which is a great relief. Other small notes: we crossed the infamous Donner Pass, which was quite fun. There’s a member of the staff whose only job seems to be giving us guidance on things we can see, which has been informative and come in handy numerous times over the trip. Our train is going to be quite late to Emeryville, but I have come to accept my fate; it has been wondrous regardless. The journey is nearly complete. It has been quite the time, and I can’t say that all of it has been unequivocally good. Despite this, it’s been a nice little vacation at the end of a busy winter break, and I am excited to dig back in at the start of IAP. For now, however, four more hours. Just four more hours. Hour 78: 4:23 PM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: Sacramento, CA train: #5, currently three hours and eight minutes late listening to:  Heathers (West End Cast Recording) It is now after the time when we should have been in Emeryville, but, instead, we are out here in Sacramento, still over an hour out. My dinner plans are moribund; it seems deeply unlikely that I will make it to the intended restaurant sufficiently before closing time for it to be reasonable. Perhaps they will be postponed to tomorrow, perhaps they will simply be cancelled. Pity my naïveté, but also the on-time performance of the California Zephyr. I have not been paying great attention to the landscape since we last spoke; indeed, I have not been paying great attention to anything except for the ticking of time and the soundtrack I have been listening to. In the fall, I had wanted to be part of the pit orchestra for the  Musical Theatre Guild . Unfortunately, that orchestra fell through for logistical reasons, and—since, of course, the thing that most motivates me is a fear that something won’t happen without me—I put in for orchestra director for the IAP show,  Heathers We have signed up for it; we will make it happen.  Outside the window, the landscape has certainly transformed quite a bit, into the green grass and red, tiled roofs that symbolize California to all kinds of people. It is mighty pretty out here, and I’d be a lot happier to see it if it were not for the fact that I was supposed to have seen it three hours ago. We will make it through eventually, though. We absolutely must. I’m not sure what I’ll spend the last hour doing; I suspect I will listen through Act 2, but, as my tone suggests, I am tired and I am losing spirit, perhaps understandably, after 78 hours. We will see what happens. Hour 80: 5:50 PM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: Martinez, CA train: #5, currently two hours and nineteen minutes late listening to:  My mood recovered a little from the local minimum from earlier; I continued studying Act 2 for a little bit, until I ran into one particularly difficult song that I’m probably going to have to listen to and look at for an extended period of time. We are around half an hour away from Emeryville, so this will likely be my last dispatch from the train. Previous Next I feel like this journey ought to mean something; that I ought to provide a little note at the end of all of this to sum it up. But, ultimately, it doesn’t mean much. It allowed me to get a break, see some new sights, feel some new things, and on the grand scheme of things that is mindnumbingly small. I’m happy to have taken it though; happy to be working on making things that could putatively be called art; happy to just be living. Most of my conclusions of travel were already made yesterday; today is just the icing on the cake; just as this journey as a whole has been the icing on  a difficult semester Without a proper conclusion in mind, therefore, let me leave you with one last picture from the train: Good night! See you in Palo Alto! Hour 80+6: 11:59 PM PST, January 6th, 2023 location: Palo Alto, CA currently listening to: the pure silence of a hotel room (nothing) Well, it’s done. This certainly was an adventure for the record books; I don’t think I’ve been on a journey quite like it, nor do I suspect that I will be going on a similar one anytime soon. I am sitting in a hotel room in Palo Alto that is, perhaps, a little nicer than I expected it to be, and I am just minutes away from finally being able to rest in a nice, soft, comfortable bed. In the intervening hours since I last wrote, I have taken a bus from Emeryville to San Francisco, run to catch the Caltrain, taken the Caltrain to downtown Palo Alto, and spent a good amount of time walking around and catching up with some friends here; one,
 
my current roommate, ⁠ 01 hi Matthew :D live ABBA cover band Previous Next I think I am eminently satisfied with it all now. It has been a long day, and a long journey, but something about coming into this big city, quite different from the suburb-dominated environment of Boston, and then feeling like I can do anything, like there is so much more to discover—it is a wonderful feeling to have at last. And, of course, there is nothing like the pure joy of meeting a friend moved away once more. I will be in the Bay Area just one more day; by the time you are reading this, I will be back in Boston. I have some more just-graduated friends to meet, and some small adventures to be had. Those will be mine to keep, however, a story for some other time. The story of this journey, finally, ends here. Oh, yeah, and I beat the election of the Speaker by like three hours, measuring to Emeryville, and one hour, measuring to Palo Alto. Alan: 1, US House of Representatives: 0. goodbye!

This is part three of a series, consisting of a lightly-edited compilation of notes from my cross-country train trip from Boston to San Francisco. If you haven’t yet, you should start by reading  part one part two Hour 45, 8:07 AM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: Denver, CO train: #5, currently on time listening to: 鱼丁糸, “ I Don’t Care (鱼版) Good morning! The sun is coming up over Denver, CO, and it is a beautiful day out here at the foot of the Rockies. There’s snow on the tracks, and the seats in the lounge car are very full as we prepare for the journey over the mountains. I am feeling rejuvenated after a good night’s sleep; I was out all the way from Omaha to just before the train entered Colorado, and then again from the border to Denver. We arrived at Denver some forty minutes early, and, although I considered going back to sleep, I ended deciding to get up and wander Union Station. I have come to the conclusion that, in fact, South Station is just bad; Union Station is beautiful, and has the added benefit that
 
the more subway-like commuter rail tracks border the passenger rail tracks, ⁠ 01 ed. note: yes, South Station also services the MBTA commuter rail, and the tracks border each other, but the MBTA trains are just...less pretty. Previous Next Out of a mild fear of getting lost or left behind, I attached myself to an old lady who was also getting up to stretch her legs; we had a lovely conversation during our walk, and ended up getting breakfast together at the only store open in the whole place. I had some miraculous french toast (8/10) and listened to her talk about her sons and her life’s many adventures, from Wisconsin to Berkeley to China. I thoroughly enjoyed her company, and am glad that I stayed up instead of going back to bed. She asked me an interesting question: “what is your one wish for this year?” I hadn’t thought about this question much, surprisingly; the turn-over from 2022 to 2023 has happened pretty softly, partially because I spent it at MIT, and partially because I’ve been trying to avoid thinking about the fact that 2023 is, in fact, my graduation year. After giving it some thought, I answered: “to make the most of this last year of college, with friends.” It’s getting cold out here; it was
 
19° F ⁠ 02 -7° C I’m excited for today; it’s going to be a wonder of a trip. Hour 47: 10:16 AM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: Fraser, CO (8550’) train: #5, currently five minutes late listening to: the sarcastic commentary of the train conductor (nothing) I said it was going to be a wonder of a trip, and, oh. my. god. it has been. We wound our ways up the mountain; I eventually got my way to a backwards-facing seat at a table, allowing me to get better shots of the landscape. The forests were increasingly covered in snow, and our conductor provided us a lot of interesting commentary, from notes about geology to some relatively spiteful comments about Nebraska. When confronted about his prejudice by a person from Nebraska, he announced an apology, noting: “The people of Nebraska can only be described with words like ‘helpful’, and ‘hospitality.’  However still Previous Next Eventually, he quieted down, much to my chagrin but likely appreciated by the chef who was trying to get some sleep. At some point, we entered the Moffat Tunnel, a six-mile-long tunnel which spans the continental divide, and emerged upon a winter wonderland, full of heavy snow banks, mountains still present as far as the eye could see, and, of course, covered in ski resorts. It is just beautiful out here; I would recommend at least taking a brief trip on the train from Denver to Grand Junction if you ever have the chance. Wow, wow, wow. Inside the car, I’ve been slowly editing a poem and mostly just glancing around in awe, taking lots of pictures. There were a lot of people contending for seats in the observation car earlier, but it seems they have mostly gone; I’m not sure exactly where. Maybe they’ve gotten bored, or maybe they got off at the ski resort. In any case, nothing too notable. I think the funniest thing I saw was two gay couples sitting across from each other; the first couple was taking pictures of each other for Instagram, and the second couple immediately did the same. What else? A seventh vote for Speaker of the House is starting. The train is going back down the mountain towards Grand Junction. There are tiny deer tracks on the frozen river. It is a beautiful day, and there is plenty of time for me to keep writing and looking around. I leave you with some other quotes from the train conductor. (on rounding a corner) “This is one of those rare moments in your life where, looking forward, you can see exactly where you’re going!” 
“Above the tracks, you can see where a developer is continuing the American tradition of destroying once-pristine wilderness for suburban sprawl.” 
“It’s called Plainview [Siding], because if you look out to the right, you can see oblivion! We call that oblivion Nebraska.” Previous Next Hour 50: 12:50 PM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: ???, CO train: #5, currently ??? minutes late listening to: a kid arguing with an adult about a game they’re playing (nothing) Since we’ve last spoken, I have mostly been asleep, unfortunately. I spent a little more time doing basically the same thing as before—writing and taking pictures—but I felt myself drifting in and out of consciousness at the table, and so, to avoid falling asleep in the observation car, went back to my seat and napped for an hour or two. Perhaps six and a half hours of sleep on a train is not quite enough to be rested. I awoke anew to a much changed landscape, which seems in my mind more typical of the American West, with shorter shrubs and redder rocks, although the snow has not eased up either. I had noticed some ranches of horses and cows before I had gone to bed, and they are now much more prevalent. The presence of elevation changes means that the landscape is still more interesting than, say, Nebraska (or Iowa, or western Illinois), but I suspect I will tire of it more quickly than the snow, which I will never bore of. We shall see. Previous Next I have no concept of exactly where we are along the route; I know we’re somewhere between Granby and Glenwood Springs, which are the two stops bordering this stretch of track, and I also know that we are still three hours short of Grand Junction, but there is no cell service anywhere out here; I had it, perhaps unsurprisingly, at the ski village, but my luck has finally ran out. I regret to inform you that I, therefore, cannot update you on the Speaker’s race. Instead, I can tell you that the aforementioned gay couples are still at their table, now judging the property value of the ranches that we’re going by. Delightful. Hour 52: 3:13 PM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: passing De Beque, CO train: #5, currently twenty-three minutes late listening to:  Do By Friday We’ve gotten much further out of the hills and are starting to approach what I assume must be the plains or desert next, with rolling hills, short shrubs, and tall grasses. At the moment, however, the landscape remains thrilling; we are following the Colorado River out of the Rockies and towards what will soon be Utah. I have spent the past few hours as I spent the morning hours: editing my thesis. I’m very happy with the progress I have made, perhaps not in quantity, but in quality. I’ve also gotten another meal, which my body assumed was dinner—since it is 5 PM, Boston time—but is probably, in practice, lunch. Everything I had this time was had before, so it will not get a new rating. Previous Next I’m still in the lounge car; a girl is sitting across from me. She has just lost her glasses and is somewhat down about the whole thing, but has been calling people to cheer her up. The lounge car has once again emptied up; apparently Glenwood Springs was another resort town, and many folks ended up getting off there. I took a little break there to get some fresh air, before returning to my work. The folks who have remained at the lounge car tables seem to be more conversational than yesterday; a lot more people are chatting and playing games, rather than sitting at a laptop, working. my brief moment at Glenwood Springs Otherwise, not much to say. The House is on a historic tenth vote, and I think it’s very likely that I will actually successfully outlast the Speaker elections. Despite arriving to Glenwood Springs late due to a signal issue and having to wait for the train going the other direction to pass us, we are scheduled to be on time to Grand Junction, so, as of yet, there is no delay; the trip will be 78 hours. Fingers crossed. Hour 54: 4:53 PM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: McInnis Canyon train: #5, currently on time listening to: 鱼丁糸, “I Don’t Care (鱼版)” I must correct a statement I made earlier; I will extend my recommendation for your trip at least through Salt Lake City, and perhaps further. After Grand Junction, I had thought the landscapes done for the day—after all, the next sight to behold must be the Sierra Nevada, right?—but I was quickly proven wrong. I had intended to return to my reading, especially since the day was getting dimmer and dimmer, but the views outside kept drawing my eyes from the page, until I decided it was better to just sit and watch. It is truly an incredible sight to behold, and I cannot help but wonder if I ought to return in the summer as well, to see everything bathed in a more proper light. Previous Next Inside the car, different people have been asking a person with a baby whether or not they can hold it for a while, which I have found both heartening and fascinating. These people are complete strangers! There must be something which establishes enough trust between them, and I am not sure if it is society at large, this particular train car, or this particular parent. It has been delightful to see a baby nonetheless, regardless of them being passed around. Since I’ve got a bit of time, a few random notes which have come to mind. First, there were often long strings of wire against the cliffside when we were traveling across the Rockies which posed some questions. A conductor later said that they were used to detect whether a significant rockslide had occurred and where, which I think is pretty cool. this is all that’s stopping your train from running into a rock Second, you may have noticed the music selection above.

Hour 57: 8:14 PM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: somewhere between Helper, UT, and Provo, UT train: #5, twenty-one minutes late listening to: a discussion that is going on three hours now (nothing) reading: Willa Cather,  It became pitch-dark very quickly after I finished writing the previous portion of this post; I watched the sky go dark, and then I spent a little while following the last gasp of the Speaker race for today.

some 434 representatives. ⁠ 07 with one vacancy. My Antonia Throughout my reading, I zoned in and out of a conversation that was happening between two exchange students from ETH Zurich with one student from BYU. This was, admittedly, a bit of a struggle, since it had been going on since approximately the end of the last post, some three hours ago. They meandered through a number of subjects; some were more difficult to stomach than others, so I turned my earbud volume up. Those topics included a discussion of college admissions and the ACT/SAT (volume all the way up), the Mormon structure of missions (whatever; I am familiar via a number of my high school friends), the BYU social structure (volume back up). At some point, my earbuds died, which was tragic. They discussed international travel and food (great!), compared a number of fast food establishments as we went through the Christmas-decorated town of Helper (tolerable), continued on to an overview of Mormon history (somewhat squeamishly self-serving for me, given discussions I’ve had with my Mormon friends), and rules-testing the acceptability of various swear words in various contexts (completely unbearable). The cultural difference was completely wild, and the attempts to bridge the gap would have been very interesting, if not for my complete frustration; the last conversation included one of the Swiss students saying, “you can’t have sex; you might as well listen to songs about sex.” helper, UT They are now talking about the linguistics of Swiss German, which is somewhat more acceptable.  My Antonia We’re an hour away from Provo, at which point the conversation will definitely end. I might switch to a different location when I begin working on something else before then, but, otherwise, there is at most an hour left to this conversation. It will be alright. Hour 60: 11:08 PM MST, January 5th, 2023 location: Salt Lake City, UT train: #5, thirteen minutes early listening to: a now fortunately silent train car (nothing) As always, this trip continues to surprise me as to the allocation of time. In some respects, with the end of the trip now some nineteen hours away, it is already certain to have been a disappointment. I had expected to be a lot more productive; lots of reading to finish, lots of writing to edit and create, lots of music to pore over and analyze. In other ways, it has been a good, worthwhile break; I have seen many things I could not have expected to see, and had a number of experiences and conversations that I could not have expected to have. I am not yet sure what to make of it, but there are still a few hours left to reflect, before we are thrust once more into that abyss called “real life.” I stayed in the lounge car for the hour to Provo. At once, the discussion became more animated, with discussions of reparations and systemic injustice in the United States. I found it hard to stomach the trashing of nuance within the debate, but I was—very fortunately—rescued by a mother and her seven-month-old baby. We had a much more pleasant conversation about our journeys, at once both about the train ride specifically and the overarching journey of our lives. It was also delightful to watch the baby squirm and reach for anything and everything within its sight. I don’t know when I stopped thinking of babies as gross and started thinking about them as cute, but I am certain that change has manifested

Redactle a version with custom link generation and multiplayer I think there is something about travel, perhaps its liminality, or the sense that one is always in the middle of something, which diminishes one’s productivity along the way. I have felt in the past few days a sort of consistently depressed motivation, which seems to prevent me from working at the rate that I normally do, even barring the distractions from other folks. On the other hand, it is this same liminality which allows me to feel uninhibited in talking to strangers, an experience which I think many people on this train have shared. We are passing by each other in a brief moment, even if that moment is some forty-two hours long, and so it is acceptable to have that brief moment of vulnerability; after all, it will be gone soon. And, besides, in this case, the journey is part of the experience. The destination hardly really matters; I’ll be in San Francisco for one full day before I fly back to Boston. It ought to be okay to be a little slower sometimes. As we pulled out of Provo, the shadow of a mountain loomed behind the city lights, so soft you could barely make it out. The Salt Lake City station was considerably less impressive, probably because the coach cars are all the way out, exposed, at the end of an open platform, giving us a sense that we are in the middle of absolutely nowhere. There are a lot of tracks here; I am surprised to learn that Utah seems to have
 
a fairly solid ⁠ 12 ed. note: apparently it’s a mostly single-track system on one line. unsure how useful it is (could be very!) but the trains certainly look nice and shiny. A little wave of exhaustion has passed over me, so I think I will do a little more reading and then be off to bed. I think I have thought most of the thoughts that will pass through my head today, so I will bid you good night a little earlier than perhaps I will actually sleep. I promise that nothing interesting will have happened in that meantime, or there will be some update beneath this. In other words, see you tomorrow. Previous Next

I came back to my hometown in Alabama during the second week. I was staying in Georgia with my family first because they’re eventually going to move there. That means that this is probably going to be the last time I’ll be in Alabama for a while, if not ever. I’m sad to leave behind my childhood home, but I’m ultimately glad that we’re moving on to other places. I visited my high school with my friend Tom to meet some of our former teachers. It’s been a while since we’ve talked. Our group chat of nerd friends eventually fell quiet when we all went off to different colleges. It was by chance that Tom and I were both in town and had nothing to do. Other than that I cut my hair shorter and he grew his hair out, it was like we were in high school again when we started joking around right off the bat, 1.5 years after we last saw each other at graduation. But a lot had still changed. As we walked down the halls, there was a good chunk of name tags next to the classroom doors with teachers’ names that I didn’t recognize. The school robotics team, which used to be a fairly small club when I first joined, now has a giant banner in the lobby with a collection of trophies on a table. The best part is that Tom and I didn’t have to follow the dress code. Thank god. The school building is small, so we were able to find our teachers pretty quickly. I was nervous that they wouldn’t even recognize me, but they all somehow remembered us from their classes. The conversations we had with our teachers were no longer conversations between student and teacher, but rather between newly fledged adults and more experienced adults. Even with the high school nostalgia, I still felt very much like a college student, based on the college-centric questions that they mostly asked us.  How  has college been?  Was  it hard with COVID around? What are you majoring in?  But there were other topics that we wouldn’t have talked with our teachers about if we were still going to high school. One subset of those were a miscellaneous mix of talking about the sanctity of Waffle House, mental illness,  Chainsaw Man , stories from one of the teachers who used to work as a therapist at a juvenile delinquent center,  classic  YouTube Flash animations . And they got to say “hell” and “dammit” around us without worrying that we’ll rat them out to our parents. The other subset of topics was snippets of information I got about what the school’s been through during the COVID quarantine and the years following that. Things about the high school that they wouldn’t tell us if we were still high school students.  Things that range from never-ending post-quarantine fatigue, to the massive number of teachers who left between 2020 and 2022, to dealing with bad authority—both the principal and the new superintendent. As much as there were “I can get through this, I’ve been through worse” vibes, there was unmistakably a tone of exhaustion and anxiety in many of the teachers’ stories. It was a happy visit, but I got back to the car with a melancholy aftertaste. I drove past downtown buildings that people once tried to renovate but eventually gave up on to let them waste away instead. I’ve already gotten used to the fact that my hometown’s moved on without me. I’m just upset that some parts that I was familiar with have gotten worse while I was gone. If there’s one major takeaway I got from high school that wasn’t academic, it was gaining humility towards where I was raised. To be humble towards the people back home who wanted to see me achieve what I wanted. It was hard for me to do that for so long. Alabama has a reputation of being the buttcrack of the United States over the years, characterized by ignorant bigots who marry their cousins. There are good, solid reasons why it’s earned this negative image, to the extent that it’ll take me a lot more than one blog post to rant about all of its problems. I was ashamed to live in Alabama throughout all of high school, and I held a lot of bitter jealousy towards people my age who got to live in places with better resources, infrastructure, and support. A main motivation that propelled me to succeed academically was to get out of Alabama because I was scared that I would be stuck there forever. But sometime over this past summer, I realized that I spent so much time running away from the place, that I didn’t take the time to appreciate the people there who stuck around and did all they could to help me and many other kids reach our goals—even if it meant sending away someone who could’ve grown up to make Alabama a better place. I won’t say that Alabama itself is a brilliant place, b ut there are brilliant people there. There are inquisitive, creative people who are using what they have to try making the world around them a little bit better, against infrastructural/systemic limitations and societal pushbacks. The lack of sparkly tourist attractions or world-renowned academic prestige shouldn’t invalidate the fact that those efforts exist. It hits a little different to meet someone here in Boston who’s from the Deep South. I guess that usually happens between two people who both come from a region that most of the population there aren’t from. There’s a subtle, yet deep, acknowledgment that passes between us, even as strangers. We finally get to have an interaction that is free from ostentatious pity that we didn’t ask for. i’ll gladly take pity money though :) Anyway, I owe a lot to my teachers. I wish I could tell you guys about how each teacher I met that day had affected me, but there’s only so much I can say before it gets drowned out in a pile of words. These are experiences that I can only truly share with the people I know from my hometown. As I’m getting prepared to move away from it, I’m starting to see how precious those connections can be.

This is part two of a series, consisting of a lightly-edited compilation of notes from my cross-country train trip from Boston to San Francisco. If you haven’t yet, you should start by reading  part one Hour 20: 9:01 AM EST, January 4th, 2023 location: South Bend, IN train: #49, currently one minute early! currently listening to: a baby crying (nothing) Good morning! It’s a beautiful morning out here in the
 
Midwest: ⁠ 01 growing up, I really did not understand why the Midwest was in the Eastern half of the country; South Dakota, which is designated by the Census Bureau as part of the Midwest, seems much more suited to the moniker. I slept surprisingly well last night, given the circumstances; I suppose this is either because I have
 
spent my entire life training for this moment, ⁠ 02 I spent a lot of time in high school on buses and I got very good at sleeping on them. Nothing much else to say right now; after all, I’ve been unconscious for most of the past hours. An hour and a half to Chicago—time to gather my belongings a bit, and get my bearings on the day. now that’s what i call america Hour 22: 9:56 AM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: Union Station, Chicago, IL listening to: the jazz that they’re playing in the station lobby Well, here we are. I’m taking a brief stop in the Great Hall of Union Station to
 
re-combobulate ⁠ 03 no, that’s not a real word; yes, I stand by it. Previous Next The rest of the train ride was as smooth as the way in; we arrived some thirty minutes early. At some point in that last hour and a half, I ended up falling asleep, and, while I was out, the clouds returned, which was sad but not unexpected. I spent the last bit of the trip wondering when Chicago would appear in view, until it inevitably did. Honestly, this first leg of the trip has been incredibly smooth; it’s going to be hard for the second leg to live up to this standard. In the meantime, though, I’ve got four hours until my train at 2 PM, so I’m gonna go get some food and do some brief sightseeing. See you soon! Hour 25: 1:19 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: Union Station, Chicago, IL listening to: still jazz Wow! The sightseeing trip was much more productive than I had expected it to be. My main intention was just to go and see   the Bean, but I managed to catch a number of other sights along the way. Notably, the station is right next to the Willis Tower, once the tallest building in the world, which
 
was impressive to look at. ⁠ 04 I did not go up. Skydeck is expensive, and I'm cheap. the tower formerly known as the sears tower I had last been in Chicago in March 2018, almost five years ago, as part of a trip for my high school orchestra. Led by my highly eccentric orchestra teacher, we wandered the streets of Chicago. Once, he ran us across the road—yelling “fly like the wind” while we were at it—into this random building called the Rookery. I spotted it again on my way, and so I took a brief look around, and then continued on my way. Here are some other highlights: Previous Next I arrived at the Bean eventually, passing the unfortunately closed-on-Wednesdays Art Institute of Chicago, which I had really wanted to visit. Instead, I got some pictures of/with the sculpture and briefly considered continuing on to Maggie Daley Park on a friend’s suggestion. Unfortunately, I had dressed a little light for the occasion, since Boston has been in a bit of a warm spell, and my hands were really starting to complain, so I turned around. Previous Next On the way back, I spent another hour or so in the Chicago Cultural Center, which is located in what used to be the Chicago Public Library. I was a little worried about lugging my suitcase around the place, but the security guard at the front said it was fine, and so off I went. There were
 
a few art exhibits, which was pleasant. ⁠ 05 by rule, I do not take pictures of art, so no photos there. Previous Next On the way back, I had lunch at Noodles & Company, a franchise I haven’t eaten at in a while. I got a cavatappi lemon parmesan with shrimp. It was definitely better than the cheeseburger, but does not yet enter the “good” portion of the range, especially since the shrimp was slightly undercooked. Solid 6.5/10 experience. Now, I’m back in the Great Hall, waiting for my train to take me away to California. This part of the trip is almost certainly going to be more…interesting, but we’ll see how it all plays out. In the meantime, Kevin McCarthy has lost a fourth vote and is on his way to losing a fifth. They say the definition of insanity is trying the same thing and expecting different results. Now, I don’t want to make too strong of a claim, but let’s just say that my bet that I get to California before the Speaker gets elected is starting to look a little more reasonable. the bridge back to Union Station Hour 26: 2:01 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: just outside of Union Station, Chicago, IL train: #5, currently on time listening to: the sounds of tracks bumping beneath a train (nothing) Just a brief update, consisting of “good news and bad news.” Good news: I’m on the train, and we left exactly on time! 
Bad news: The seats are full, and I’ve been stuck with an aisle seat. The person I’m sitting next to is also going to Emeryville. Oh boy. Still Hour 26: 2:17 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: somewhere in the Chicago suburbs train: #5, currently on time listening to: the rush of wind past a double-decker train (nothing) Breaking my “at most one update per hour” rule to say that the bad news has been alleviated by the existence of a LOUNGE CAR. THIS THING HAS WINDOWS EVERYWHERE. My seatmate and I have chatted briefly; apparently, they had taken the train from San Francisco to Chicago earlier and are now on their way back, and
 
they seem nice enough to chat with. ⁠ 06 this is a high bar; I usually hate talking to strangers. ed. note: I don’t know why my picture of the lounge car was so bad, but here we are Hour 27, 3:07 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: passing Somonauk, IL train: #5, currently four minutes late listening to: the sounds of the Great Plains (nothing) reading: Burt & Mikics,  I am, expectedly, still in the lounge car. It is getting darker more quickly than I would like, but I am hoping that there is still a good hour or two of working conditions, before I have to provide something other than natural light. I am back to  Art of the Sonnet Outside the gorgeous windows of the train, it is fields as far as the eye can see. For the first thirty or forty minutes, we were still in the suburbs, with constant roads and two story houses—a real Newton, Massachusetts look, if you will. Now, we are in true farm country, where everything looks the same for hundreds of miles. As someone who grew up in South Dakota, I am allowed to say this! All of South Dakota—outside of the Black Hills—looks exactly like this. It’s a nice, dull, foggy day; nothing to write home about. galesburg, IL Inside the lounge car, everybody seems to have found their own table, with a few extras to spare. A couple people are reading books or writing in notebooks; a few couples are eating dinner from the cafe car and chatting with each other; one person is putting on their nails for the day. It’s a real hodge-podge of people, and I’m surprised more folks haven’t found their way up here yet, although I’m certainly not complaining about it. One final update, since I expect that I will be losing the ability to update you on the House Speaker race reasonably soon. (I am not so sure about the data coverage out here on the Plains.) Kevin McCarthy is on his way to losing a sixth ballot. It seems likely that they’ll adjourn to at least tomorrow, meaning that I will be at least halfway through my trip when they select the Speaker of the House. Who knew. Regardless, I’d much rather be me than any member of the House at the moment. Out here, reading and writing, stuck on a train for another fifty hours—that’s the life. Hour 30, 5:50 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: Burlington, IA train: #5, currently eighteen minutes late listening to:  特别的爱给特别的你 07 for a discussion of where I discovered this song (among other things), see <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/it-is-the-escape/">this post</a>. reading: Willa Cather,  It is now pitch-dark outside, a little earlier than I had hoped. We have just crossed the Mississippi, which I did not get a great view of, partially on account of the darkness, and partially on account of the fact that everything bright in Burlington was apparently on the northern side of the train, and I am seated on the southern side. Alas. yep, that’s definitely the Mississippi For the most part, everything else about the views outside the window has been standard. Funnily enough, I have just started reading  My Antonia On this note, one thing I have been noticing is the infrastructure surrounding the railroad; I have seen many tracks split off onto what are now likely disused sidings next to old warehouses, and many towns which seems like they would not exist but for what seems like a station building. I am not saying that this is a novel observation, only that it is exciting to see something concrete reinforce a fact we usually only know from textbooks:
 
the importance of the railroad in the development of the American West. ⁠ 08 perhaps I should have known this already given that I grew up in the Great Plains, but South Dakota has never been particularly popular, and, in fact, is one of two American states without Amtrak passenger service at all. The other is Wyoming. Inside the train, things are going quite swimmingly. People have started to fill up the lounge car a little more, perhaps discovering a new environment to stretch their legs, perhaps just hungry—the cafe is on the bottom level of this car. People are also quite talkative and friendly, which probably owes partially to the increased space and decreased noise in comparison to airplanes; I am not personally interested in this perk, but I could see people enjoying it. I am probably going to retire to my actual seat soon enough, after putting my stuff back and grabbing dinner. And, in Washington, D.C., they have scheduled another vote for 8 PM. Let’s see how that one goes. Hour 32, 7:57 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: passing Chariton, IA train: #5, currently sixteen minutes late listening to: the 4W Discord call The past two hours have passed fairly uneventfully. My network connection, predictably, has become somewhat more inconsistent as we cross the nothing-scape of Iowa. To be honest, I don’t really believe these places are real, but, alas, Paolo promises me they are, so I guess I will have to take his word for it. What has happened since we last spoke? I bought a hot dog this time—this train also does not have the pizza I so desire, but, fortunately, all hot dogs kind of taste the same, and so this meal was certainly more enjoyable than the cheeseburger from yesterday. The bread is still not good, but it is not quite as bad as it was. I will give it a 6/10. the ketchup placement is my fault I spent some time texting friends, back at my actual seat, before my internet started cutting in and out. Oh, well. I found my seat unbearable, and so I returned to working in the lounge car. Currently, I’m sitting at the only table without a light; hopefully, I’ll get one with a light soon enough. I’ll probably work on some poetry and go to bed soon enough; that’ll be it. The house adjournment was a bit of a nothing ball; we’re back to the “over halfway there” minimum for when they finish. Hour 33, 9:07 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: somewhere just out of Crestron, IA train: #5, currently sixteen minutes late listening to: a conversation between two people from Omaha (nothing) I have not done any of the things I’ve planned to do. This would be a theme of this series, if it were not for the fact that this is, in fact, a theme of my overall life already. I read a little more of  My Antonia I am probably going to stay up until Omaha; we’ll cross the Missouri, if it’ll be visible in this complete darkness, and then it’ll be probably 10:40 PM, or 11:40 from my old time zone. It’ll be interesting. I will actually write now, or I will regret the day immensely. Hour 35, 10:59 PM CST, January 4th, 2023 location: Omaha, NE train: #5, currently on time listening to: the soothing sound of the train air circulation system (nothing) The two people kept chatting; for a while, they were talking about the economics of Amtrak, which was simultaneously enlightening and also incredibly boring. For another while,
 
they were pointing out all the sights and locations on the way into Omaha, ⁠ 09 highlight of this discussion was “the old catfish lake was right over here.” When we arrived in Omaha, we had a bit of extra time, so I stepped outside to take a breather. While I was standing on the platform, it started to snow, first a little, and then slowly becoming heavier. Previous Next I have always loved snow, and so I will take its presence as a good omen, even if it may threaten to disrupt the rest of the journey. One of the places this train must go on its way to California is Reno, NV. As of mid-day, the National Weather Service station had this in its forecast discussion: “I really want to emphasize how complex the [precipitation] types will be for [western] Nevada, especially areas below 5500 feet…Be ready for anything.” On the other side of the border, in Truckee, CA, somewhere between one and two feet of snow is possible. the stuff of nightmares That, however, is a problem for Alan on the morning of January 6th, two whole days from now! The problem for Alan right now is merely getting to bed. Good night!

i haven’t written about what’s been happening in my life at all in the past month, not here nor in my personal notes. i want to say that i’ve been busy, but that’s not true. i haven’t been busy much at all. let’s see, december. towards the end of the semester is the time when all the performance groups do their semester performances, and i don’t go to a lot of them. sometimes it was because i was busy doing something else. but most of the time it was because i couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed. i think at that time of semester i spent a lot of time playing  kingdom of loathing one of the things that occupied my mind at the time was  hydrant firehose there was a blogger checkin that was particularly memorable, which involved some singing. there’s video games that happened. vampire survivors, iris and the giant, shapez.io. i had one final exam, for 24.901 introduction to phonology, and that went fine. i helped scan and grade another final exam, for 6.3900 [6.036] introduction to machine learning, which took several hours but went fine. on christmas i went to eat dimsum with some esp friends who were staying over for break: zawad, lixuan, and wasabi. we’re all international students, which is part of the reason we were staying in mit for winter break. that night and the next night i spent some time with friends from galactic, the team i do  mystery hunt during winter break i joined my second dungeons and dragons campaign, with the same esp friends who were staying over for break. we played every other day, for seven sessions, each around four to five hours. it was a lot of dnd in a short time, and we went from level 1 to 4, and i had a lot of fun playing my half-elf rogue! i got into the game in a way i didn’t when i played dnd digitally. i resubscribed to dropout and started watching dimension 20 again, and i love the game so much now. over winter break i also met with some friends who were in the area, like junwon and victor. for the first week of january, jeffery and andrew started sleeping over, and i’m still surprised how we managed to fit three people in my single room. they stayed for a week and we did lots of things together, like eat meals, do work, hang out in the  sipb i got my grades. they’re great. i’ve been doing work for the philippine math and informatics olympiads again. i’ve been doing more square dancing, and that’s fun. a lot of my writing energy is going into this larp i’m writing, for the  assassins guild . gah. i’m not even sure how much i’m enjoying this, versus how much i’m doing this out of obligation. the other thursday there was a promys meetup. promys was this summer camp i went to back in high school, and i was a counselor for a few years too. there’s a promys meetup every  jmm during the meetup andrew and i saw jiahua, a friend we met in promys, and we decided to schedule dinner the next night. we ate at oath, this pizza place near mit, and talked about our lives since promys. it went well. it’s nice having acquaintances that i can not talk to for years, and when we see each other we can schedule a meal and talk and it’s like no time has passed. jeffery and andrew left a few days ago. the night they left i felt so lonely. in an appointment with my therapist i talk about how a lot of my thoughts are directed to moving on. it’s the feeling i have with sipb when i’m trying to find frosh who’ll take lead on hydrant. or when, for puzzle club, i’m letting the juniors handle more logistics. or when in esp i’ve spent more time documenting what i know than doing things. or when for the assassins guild, i’m writing a game, because that’s what people do when they’re old. it’s not that, i mean, my last semester hasn’t even started yet! but the end feels so near. and soon enough, i’ll need to apply for  opt

Last week, I took Amtrak across the country, from Boston to San Francisco. Along the eighty-hour journey, I took some notes about what I was up to, what was happening around the train, what I was feeling, and a number of…other things. Over the course of the next four days, I will be posting the notes from the trip, lightly edited, with accompanying pictures. Here are the notes from the first day. Hour -1: 12:04 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: South Station, Boston, MA currently listening to: the beautiful sounds of South Station (nothing) I am sitting on a wooden bench in South Station, just across from the  Au Bon Pain 
find some way to kill the time. ⁠ 01 notably, I’m watching the House Speaker election very closely. The plan is as follows: I will be taking the Amtrak across the country. More specifically, the Lake Shore Limited will take me to Chicago, arriving at 10:12 AM CST on January 4th, some twenty-two hours later. From there, the California Zephyr will take me to San Francisco, arriving at 5 PM PST on January 6th, by way of a bus from Emeryville, CA, another fifty-six hours later. All in all, the trip totals seventy-eight hours of travel, with a four-hour layover in Chicago. That is, of course, if everything goes to plan. By the looks of it, there’s nasty storm system located out west that will probably put a pretty big dent in the already-not-great on-time track record of the Zephyr. We will have to see exactly how it goes, but I suspect that this trip will probably end up over seventy-eight hours. In the meantime, I’ve brought everything I need to entertain me: more books than I can imagine finishing in three days, a notebook and a couple of pens, the piano-conductor score to the musical  Heathers  I’ll keep updating this log, probably once every two or three hours, but, in what is perhaps not a great omen, one of the South Station pigeons has just…left its leavings with pinpoint accuracy on my shoe, so I will have to go find a napkin. See you again soon. Previous Next Hour 0: 12:51 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: just outside of South Station, beneath the I-90/I-93 interchange train: #449, currently running on time currently listening to: Rachmaninoff,  Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini And we’re off! The Lake Shore Limited starts off in Boston and New York and joins up to form a larger train in Chicago; today, they’ve got just one coach car on the leg from Boston. It’s still a pretty spacious environment; definitely lots more legroom than on a plane, and, for the moment, there’s nobody sitting next to me, which is a bonus. There’s also an outlet on the wall right next to me, which is even better. I suspect we’ll be picking up more people in Back Bay, but we’ll see how that goes. The people behind me are talking about Ohio, and the Amtrak conductor has just gone and rambled through a list of all the stations we’re stopping at…it’s certainly a lot. Not much to talk about at the moment, since we’re still in home sweet home, Boston. I think I’ll sit around and follow the House leadership election for a little longer, and then start reading something. Updates to come. Previous Next Hour 1: 1:59 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: Worcester, MA train: #449, currently on time currently listening to: Rachmaninoff, Variations on a Theme of Corelli We’re currently waiting outside of Worcester, MA. So far, the theme has been nothing out of the expected; Massachusetts continues to look like Massachusetts, and the world ticks on. Most of the landscape has looked the same; a thin strip of trees between us and a row of houses, which must be incredibly loud to live in. This is not to say it is completely boring, but it will almost certainly not be able to compare with
 
some of the landscapes which will come later along the trip. ⁠ 02 read: Rocky Mountains. On the other hand, Worcester, marks the edge of the unknown for me, personally. The path of the train up to Framingham was pretty familiar, passing the Boston Bruins stadium on the way out, as well as portions of Newton I’ve walked through countless times. Framingham and Ashland, a little further out, also occupy special places in my heart, having walked through them on  my marathon walk 
Commuter Rail ⁠ 03 trains run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which cover the region, helping commuters get to work in Boston and helping me go exploring! 
the Massachusetts RMV, ⁠ 04 what Massachusetts calls its DMV for whatever godforsaken reason. On a more logistical note, Worcester also marks an important turnover with regards to train routes. One of the reasons Amtrak gives for its somewhat poor on time performance is that it often doesn’t own the tracks it travels over, instead contracting for “trackage rights” on freight railroads. This means that trains are often asked to stand-by in order for freight trains from the railroad in charge to pass them,
 
resulting in cascading delays. ⁠ 05 this is technically prohibited by federal law, but sometimes happens anyways, and, in any case, is too deep of a rabbithole to be relevant for this post. Amtrak report card Inside the train, there is now someone in the seat next to me, reading about
 
monetary policy, funnily enough. ⁠ 06 as discussed <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/difficult-difficult-lemon-difficult/">here</a>, I had to do a final paper on Ben Bernanke. Oh, yeah, and Kevin McCarthy has failed to win on the first ballot.  Interesting. Hour 3: 3:59 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: somewhere between Russell and Huntington, MA train: #449, currently on time currently listening to: train horns (nothing) currently reading: Burt & Mikics,  The landscape has certainly gotten more interesting since the start of hour 2; shortly after Worcester, the houses next to the track gave way to deeper tranches of fields and forest. I’ve quickly discovered how hard it is to get good pictures in the fog, especially when moving at high velocity; we’ll have to see how that affects the rest of these entries. WHY IS THIS SO BLURRY We pulled into Springfield, MA, which seemed like a nice, quaint city, after which the terrain began to change. We crossed the Connecticut River and then spent a significant amount of time next to the Westfield River. The generally flat terrain has started to become significantly hillier, as we enter what I assume to be the Berkshires. To be honest, I don’t know that much about the Berkshires; I only have a vague notion of them, trickled down from pop culture, of being a magical place where rich people live. It does seem quite mystical from the window; fog blanketing hills extending off into the distance above a river with unmelted snow lining its banks—this is good stuff. Previous Next The talkative duo behind me kept at it for another hour or so, but they finally quieted down around Springfield. Regardless of their interference, I have been reading Burt & Mikics’  The Art of the Sonnet sestinas 
classic Shakespearean way. ⁠ 07 e.g., 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.' Oh, and last updates! The person next to me has, thankfully, stopped reading about monetary policy. They spent a little while reading about mergers & acquisitions, which I’m not convinced is better, but that, too ended after a while. And, of course, Kevin McCarthy has failed to win a second vote, and is perhaps on his way to losing a third. (I’m not sure about the latter; the train’s Wi-fi and my phone’s data plan are both not working right now.) Hour 5: 5:57 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: Albany-Rensselaer, NY train: #449, currently on time currently listening to:  My Brother, My Brother, and Me We’ve just pulled into Albany, NY! I spent a little time staring out of the window, up until Pittsfield, MA, or so. I was surprised by the number of people who took the train one stop, either from Springfield to Pittsfield or from Pittsfield to Albany, although I suppose that it may actually be reasonably convenient. In any case, it is now pitch black outside; nothing to be seen at all, nothing whatsoever. At Pittsfield, a particularly loud passenger got on; I put on my earbuds, put on a podcast, and zoned out for a little while, which was surprisingly restful, despite not having gone to sleep. It seems that the loud passenger has now departed—somewhat unwillingly, perhaps, since there seems to be some transit police involved at the back of the car—and a lot of people have gotten off the train. We’re here for another hour, so I’ll spend some time wandering the station, and then we’ll be off again, hooked up to the train coming from New York. Hour 6: 7:11 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: just outside of Albany-Rensselaer, NY train: #49, currently on time currently listening to: Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini And we’re off again! I got off the train briefly, spotting the train from New York pulling in on the neighboring track as I went. The station building was quite pretty, and it was nice to stretch my legs briefly and take a look around. I eventually returned to my segment of the train, which pulled forward, and then reversed to join the cars from New York! This was pretty cool. Previous Next The scenery outside the window is sparse but what scarce scenes we do get are quite pretty. Right out of the station, we crossed the Hudson River, next to which I spotted a pedestrian path, lit up with all sorts of colors. A little further down the road, a very old supermarket building with large painted lettering. It seems this area of the state is just slightly more populated than the section we were in previously, especially as our next stop, Schenectady, is only 20 minutes away, but I expect wilderness shortly thereafter. the hudson river! please excuse the reflection of my hands; you will be seeing a lot of them So far, everything on this trip has gone exceptionally smoothly. Bad omens—beyond just the pigeon, of course—continue to pile up out West, however. Two trains have been stuck waiting for boulders to be cleared off the track near Denver for some hours, and there is a flurry of different weather warnings and watches: avalanche, winter storms, flash flood, the list goes on. The California Zephyr for today – i.e., the train immediately before mine – left four hours late due to incoming equipment issues. This is all to say, I’m increasingly nervous – but we’ll see how it goes. (Also, the person next to me is now reading Jordan Peterson Tweets, which does not help the vibe.) And, most importantly, my several-days-after-the-fact-for-you political reporting. Kevin McCarthy has lost a third vote and the House has adjourned until tomorrow at noon, when I will be exploring Chicago. At the moment, it still seems unlikely that my train ride will outlast the election for Speaker, but it seemed unlikely (to me, in any case) that Kevin McCarthy’s plan for “getting elected speaker” would be “try the same vote three times,” so anything could happen! We will see… In the meantime, I’m getting quite peckish. Perhaps a visit to the cafe car will help. Hour 9: 9:49 PM EST, Jan 3, 2023 location: Schenectady, NY train: #49, four minutes early! currently listening to: a child, talking loudly in the back of the train car (nothing) currently reading: Burt & Mikics,  The trip continues; we are now waiting at the station at Schenectady, NY, presumably because of the train that seems to be going past us on the right. Surprisingly enough, the train is still running on schedule! I am now feeling reasonably ready to sleep, but the train car lights are still on, and, besides, I am waiting for the person sitting next to me to leave at Rochester, the next stop, so I can grab a couple things from my suitcase. The past three hours have passed in a kind of daze: I bought a cheeseburger at the cafe car, ate it there, and then eventually returned to my seat, alternating between reading poems and reading Twitter, which is perhaps not the healthiest thing to do, but is better than just reading Twitter. …it doesn’t look great, does it I will rate the Amtrak cheeseburger a solid 5/10 experience. It was food and, unlike some food I have eaten, was not so bad that it brought me negative value. Unfortunately, that is about all I can say about it. I will try a different offering when the cafe car opens for breakfast. I am quickly running out of things to describe, so I will include just two anecdotes: PA: “Our next station stop is Amsterdam.” 
me, internally: God, I wish we had a train to Amsterdam. Imagine that. Overseas travel. 
PA: “Sorry about that, our next station stop is Utica.” 
me, internally: My already palpable disappointment has multiplied sevenfold. Child at the back of the train car: “When do we get to Waterloo[, Indiana]?” 
Parent: “7 AM.” 
Child: “7 o’clock in the morning? That’s a hundred years from now!” Okay, that’s enough of that. Off to read something different and wait for our eventual arrival in Rochester. Hour 10: 11:31 PM EST, January 3rd, 2023 location: Rochester, NY train: #49, still four minutes early! currently listening to:  sodagreen / 苏打绿 And, finally, Rochester. I’ll be going to bed after this post, I think; it’s been a solid day one, and we will see what the next three days bring to us. Thus far, I’ve been pretty satisfied with the train, and reasonably satisfied with the experience; there’s a little more active work I have to get done in the next few days, which I’m sure I’ll write about, but for now, I’m very happy. So—what occupied the last hour? Exactly nothing. I stared out the window and listened to a bunch of sodagreen, a popular Taiwanese indie band that
 
I happen to like a lot. ⁠ 08 the lyrics! The melodies! The rhythms! The extended instrumental breaks! What’s not to love? As we got closer to Rochester, more lights and roads were visible, and so I spent more time appreciating the outside; it’s either slightly rainy or just extremely foggy and moist, and I am a sucker for the sight of lights reflected on a slick pavement. We eventually pulled in to the station, and after my seatmate departed, I grabbed my suitcase, unpacked some important objects, and then went and brushed my teeth, which was
 
a huge crisis of confidence. ⁠ 09 I hate public restrooms, with a burning passion. There are only a few restrooms on campus which I am willing to use, and the list grows smaller every day. I will spare you this rant as well. For now, however, good night. I leave you with a picture of the most important object: Nat.

here A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon  Gary Wang When I found his page on December 25th, it had only been created three days prior, and was quite sparse. what the page looked like when I found it The last time I edited a Wikipedia page was when I was eleven years old. I think I edited some governmental history of a foreign country and put my own name down as the prime minister. I sent the link to my friends, like,  . Then I got banned from Wikipedia for vandalism. I’m not entirely sure what compelled me to make a Wikipedia account and add more to Gary Wang’s Wikipedia page. It was winter break and I was bored, sure. Yes, I feel some connection to this entire FTX catastrophe as SBF and Gary Wang both attended MIT, my current institution—it has stirred up questions for me about what an MIT education should mean, what responsibilities the privilege of being associated with a prestigious school brings, and what blind spots might be embedded in my studies as a math and computer science double-major. These are really interesting questions to me and I might write more about them in a later post. If I were being uncharitable to myself, maybe I would say it was ego—contributing to such a high-profile individual’s Wikipedia page is one of the easiest, high-impact avenues of shaping collective knowledge. Everybody looks at Wikipedia, it has great SEO, yet anybody can edit it (albeit with the risk of getting banned, as my sixth-grade experience demonstrated). There also probably was some sense of kinship: yes, Wang is the most common surname in the world, but it’s still a surname that I share with Gary. He’s not that much older than me, and he studied computer science and mathematics at MIT too. Of course, these are surface-level similarities and I have no insight into his interior life, and no reason to believe we have anything else in common. Still, I grew up without seeing many tech executives who looked like me. I won’t pretend writing his Wikipedia page was a meaningful instance of anti-racism activism, but Gary Wang’s (likely voluntary) erasure from FTX’s frenzied publicity, despite his significant role within the company, made me want to amplify his presence within the narrative. A fact that might’ve tugged at my subconscious: in  , a heist film about the MIT Blackjack Team, the protagonist was white, despite being Asian American in real life. Anyway, I scoured the internet for reliable sources on Gary Wang’s life, and added what I could find. Out of curiosity, I also looked him up in the MIT alumni directory, although I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t count as a Wikipedia source, since it’s only accessible to MIT affiliates. the page after I added more information There wasn’t too much information available on the Internet. My goal wasn’t to smear Gary or to exalt him. I simply wanted to humanize him by providing a brief sketch of his life. SBF and Caroline Ellison received multiple  articles  detailing their childhoods In the past two weeks or so since I filled out his Wikipedia page, it has received more views than I anticipated, given that the FTX crash is no longer front-page news: As the investigation into FTX progresses, I’m sure more information pertaining to Gary will surface publicly. I don’t know if I’ll continue updating his Wikipedia page—my goal was never to salaciously document every detail about this scandal, and I’ve gleaned enough information already to satisfy my own curiosities. If I were to continue editing Wikipedia, I think those efforts would be better spent elsewhere, as there are so many other stories that should be researched and recorded.

playlist .  I spent last semester trying to  catch my breath  feeling ready to start the next thing. The issue is, that I don’t know how long this feeling is meant to last for. Because I don’t know what that next thing will be– that next big thing that’ll finally get me out of this slump of  emo-ish blogs , it just is rather boring. I’ve been feeling like I’m on the brink of something bigger coming around the corner, but with no clue what that bigger thing is supposed to be, I’m just waiting. Sure, it’s nice to feel excited about something– especially if that something is the intense MIT workload or something akin to this, but it’s also anxiety inducing. At least now I’m above ground. I’m no longer drowning, and I’m just antsy for some project to get my hands dirty. Thankfully, I have a few of those projects happening this IAP. That’s right, it’s a good old fashioned “here’s what I’m doing over IAP” blogpost. (Honestly this was partially inspired by Fatima’s  semester in checkboxes . 
I’ve written about this  before  cool to me. This year, lectures are officially being recorded to be put on MIT  OpenCourseWare 
outfits for presenting, ⁠ 01 maybe I should do a blog on these outfits 
(more on this later….) . 
The DRP is a program run by the math department in which undergraduate students are paired with graduate students and postdoctorates to read   something. This year, my partner and I are jumping between three different books/sets of notes: i)   by Steven Krantz, 
ii)   lecture notes from the class run by Larry Guth, and 
iii)   by Ciprian Demeter. Now that I say this out loud, this seems like a lot. But I promise I’m enjoying the readings. . 
This should be relatively obvious given this is being written in, y’know, a blog, but also I’ve been writing for personal stuff. There’s a poetry workshop being run this IAP I hope to be a part of, and I’ve gotten a huge number of notebooks for this Christmas that I’ve been  
putting to good use. ⁠ 02 Did you know: Not everything written needs to be put online! Insane. . 
Poorly, but UROPing nonetheless. Someone cited my work recently at a conference I went to. Really cool feeling. . 
For as few people are on campus right now (due to IAP), there’s a lot of people I’ve been meaning to talk to and catch up with. None of these things feel like they will be conclusion to my slump of emo-blogs, but it’s nice to just feel like I can b r e a t h e. Maybe this is the best conclusion I can ever hope for, but I optimistically choose to believe that something bigger is coming. Maybe it’ll be one of these things. Who knows. Like  CJ #IAP

Reading is one of the few real hobbies I’ve managed to hold onto throughout my time at MIT, not that I have much time to read during the semesters. Still, it’s nice to look back at the past year, which has been a rather difficult one, and remember all of the good books I found time to enjoy. So, to reflect on that reading, here’s some mini-reviews of everything I read in 2022. Donna Tartt (5/5)  is, of course, a famous book, particularly in certain circles. I’ve spent my fair share of time on Tumblr as a teen,  I went through a dark academia phase – it’s a surprise I hadn’t picked this book up earlier. I bought the book over quarantine but never got to it, so, when I found out that it was one of my friends’ favorite book, I decided it was finally time to read it. Turns out, I’m still the same person that grew up on Tumblr, because I really loved it. The novel tells the story of a secretive group of students at a secluded New England college; it’s filled with intrigue, mysticism, and references to the classics. Is it a little corny? Maybe. Is it beautifully written? Absolutely. Above all else, I loved the world that Tartt created in the book, and the ease with which is sucked me in. , N. K. Jemisin (3/5) I’ll start off by saying that I really wanted to like this book. From the second it was announced, I found myself excited by the concept: sentient cities? A fantasy love letter to New York? I was hooked. So hooked, even, that I waited for the paperback release so that I could buy my own copy. When, after some trials and tribulations, I finally got my hands on a copy this summer, I dove right in. I was back home in New York for a couple of weeks, it was perfect timing. And still, despite all this, I couldn’t bring myself to love the book. Although I liked the concepts of the book–sentient cities and the different “avatars” that carry their spirits, gentrification as a living, breathing evil–Jemisin’s writing style made it hard for me to stay grounded in that world. I’m a fan of flowery, (often needlessly) complex language. I like texts that make me work for their meaning, and this was one didn’t. Jemisin is, however, an extremely popular and successful author, so I imagine her writing must appeal to most people, just not to me. , Thomas S. Kuhn (5/5) One of my closest friends is a biology and philosophy double major, and every now and then he lends me a book to read about the philosophy of science, or something adjacent. This classic book by Kuhn was the first in the series of his suggested reading, and I actually read the bulk of it in 2021, but set it aside before I could finish it. So, in 2022, I came back and finished off the last chapters. The book presents Kuhn’s famous theory about the progression of scientific knowledge: he argues that science is not a continuous series of discoveries, but rather a series of “paradigm shifts” that change the very assumptions on which a field of science is founded. Overall, the book was a good introduction to this sort of meta-thinking about science, and it was interesting to engage with science as a field in itself. , Martha Wells (5/5) Sometimes all I want is some mindless science fiction: something fun, that reads easily and has the cadence of any of my favorite scifi shows. The trouble is, most “easy” sci-fi on the market is either poorly written, needlessly misogynistic, or both. The   series, in contrast, is perfect. It’s well written, funny, has an interesting plot and a cool setting. It feels mindless and reads quickly while also touching upon some serious themes, like the concepts of identity, agency, and the curse of late-stage capitalism. I cannot recommend this series enough. , Kurt Vonnegut (5/5) Kurt Vonnegut is my dad’s favorite author, so we have plenty of his books at home. Despite this, and despite science fiction being my favorite genre, I had never read him before this year. This summer, I decided to remedy that, and picked  out from my dad’s shelves. I ended up reading most of the book in one sitting, during one particularly awful night of traveling (described  here , Sophia Hembeck (2/5) I picked this book up on a whim, this summer in Berlin. I was in a weird mood, walking around the city, and stopped by a bookshop because that’s what I do when I walk around the city in a weird mood. I was yearning for something contemplative and slightly odd, and this book, subtitled   seemed exactly that. Self-published by a German-born author living in Scotland, the book contemplates the concepts of home, belonging, and the search for one’s self. Some of the ideas Hembeck put forth were interesting, but I didn’t really gain much new insight, and I really didn’t enjoy her style–another case of personal preference, maybe. , Kirsty Bell (4/5) This book was another spontaneous Berlin purchase. It’s a semi-historical, semi-autobiographical piece about Berlin, and about Bell’s relationship to it. She starts with her house in Berlin, and its leaking pipes, and walks through the entire history of Berlin, always coming back to her house and the view from her window. This intertwining of the historical and the personal was really well done, and helped carry the narrative of the book. I also learned a lot about Berlin – despite having
 
spent ⁠ 01 I was literally reading this in August on the plane out of Berlin , Becky Chambers (4/5) Becky Chambers might just be my favorite author. Ever since discovering her through the  series, I have been looking forward to each new release with anticipation. She writes a kind of pure, optimistic scifi, filled with diverse–and often queer–characters. The   series explores a post-post-apocalyptic utopia: a world that has caused its own destruction, and then moved past it to a brighter future. The books follow a monk and a robot as they journey through this world and ponder the fundamental questions of life. It’s slow, meditative, and so, so warm. Haruki Murakami (3/5) I’m a big fan of Murakami’s writing, despite some of its persistent
 
shortcomings ⁠ 02 for one, his representations of women are often rather misogynistic I’ll also mention some books I’ve made decent progress on, but haven’t finished just yet: Robin Wall Kimmerer: a beautiful book about Indigenous views of nature. , Karl Popper: another famous theory of how science advances. Carlos Ruiz Zafón: a novel about a mysterious book, set in mid-20th century Barcelona. I look forward to finishing these books and others in 2023 :) #let's just ignore that I haven't blogged since the summer #oops

I’ve been blacksmithing for just shy of a year. This fall, I took 3.096: Architectural Ironwork, a class which not only counts as both 2-A credit and HASS credit for me, but also accelerated my blacksmithing knowledge and practice hours considerably. And I made a dragon sword! First we had some lessons: Reach toward hot things (or potentially hot things) slowly. Feel the heat rising from them. I move differently in the forge. Generally you more often get burned not by red-hot pieces, which are obviously hot, but by cooling black metal that still holds a lot of heat. tapering is when you make the end of a bar thin and pointy. rivets are like double-ended nails that hold pieces of metal together. They are very hard to forge. sheet metal can be cut and textured into leaves (or cacti, or, as a grad student in the class showed, into wavy table legs). we also learned how to cut fitted slots and holes into iron using only hand tools. chisel work is done by setting a hot workpiece into a vise (or, if it’s flat, laying it on an anvil) and molding the exterior with chisels. This is how you make dragons! riveted V (for Velez), spiral, and fitted bars exploratory project: bottle openers! Each person chose their own element of ironwork to iterate 5 times in an exploratory project. I decided to make 5 bottle openers, since I already had a few from last semester and wanted to come up with new designs. The first one I made was typical bottle opener fashion, made by punching a hole and shaping one end, then using a punch to flatten the tab of the bottle opener. This one was set opposite a skull, which I made while learning how to use chisels. The second bottle opener was more unique: I tied some thin iron into a knot, inspired by my classmate’s project of tying knots and weaving metal. Then I bent the other side over and punched a tab. my original design! The key ring curl burned off in the fire, but otherwise pretty close The third bottle opener is a cool wavy shape where the bottom curve goes perpendicular to the plane of the bottle and pops off the top. Unfortunately I didn’t make this one long enough to have proper leverage, so it only works with a moderate amount of effort. comparison with my previous leaf design — has some light chisel work but is very flat look at how 3-D the leaf is! The fourth one experiments with leaves (a success!) and twists on a round bar (ehh), and has a normal punched out bottle opener opposite the leaf. The fifth one, my personal favorite, is a heart with the bottle-opening tab at the crux of the heart. Getting the two sides of a heart to be even is about as easy as herding cats, and to add to that, I needed a specific amount of space between the tab and the sides of the heart. Happily this worked on the first try! Now that I had made a bottle opener
 
more times ⁠ 01 seven, counting the two from last year I designed my project around two parameters: I wanted to use new skills and tools and to design a project with a sculptural element. I was also excited by dragon-making, my favorite new skill from 3.096. dragon horns for a different dragon On the first or second day of class, the prof showed a few examples of modern blacksmithing, ranging from the “new and innovative” to the

1/2 an episode. ⁠ 03 props to whoever manages to consume tv at this school How better to combine dragons and swords than to make the hilt be a dragon? notice the precise measurements I started looking for inspiration and was pleased to find that while some creators had attached dragon heads to various parts of swords, generally the hilt or the thumb guard, no one had created a hilt that was also a sculpture of a dragon.  common example of dragons applied to swords As you can see in my drawings, the dragon hilt is quite sculptural, but also serves functional purposes:  the tail wrapped around the hilt is also a guard against other blades;  the tip of the tail is a thumb guard;  the head is also a weight to counter-balance the sword and make it more ergonomic to hold.  Technical development and process The tools which were most new to me in 3.096 were the power hammer, the hydraulic press, oxy-acetylene torch, and chisels. I wound up using all four of these during the design of this blade. I followed these steps: Make the dragon head split the bar — ½ for the blade, ½ for the tail I cut it with a bandsaw and slammed it against the anvil to get the two pieces to separate. taper and wrap the tail

I clamped my sword in a vise and asked someone to heat up sections of the tail while I wrapped the tail with giant pliers. Previous Next lengthen the blade the  squeezes down with a pressure from 1000-3000 psi. It makes hot iron look like play dough. You can squash a workpiece in seconds when it would have taken several rounds of hammering to achieve the same result. hammer the blade could use a power hammer, but those are too loud to be turned on during the work day, so I mostly used a handheld hammer.  became weaker and more brittle as I re-heated the sword and hammered it by hand, and eventually, a small piece on the end of the sword broke off entirely. I went and welded the other thin sections to ensure that they didn’t break off, too. Previous Next A solution to this would have been to use stoppers in the hydraulic press to lengthen out the blade evenly. I learned that these existed the week I finished my sword, but will likely employ them the next time. grind I used a sander to make the sword sharp and an angle grinder with a wire wheel to make the blade and hilt shiny. sandblast how many sandblasters are hanging out in unassuming basement rooms? Unknown, but more than 2. shiny! polish Previous Next reflection After finishing the project, there are a few things I would change if I were to do it again: 1. make the dragon more dragon-like I would emphasize the dragon’s features more. In particular, the horns were quite small, and the scales weren’t very pronounced. Too much heat can distort fine detail, so it would probably have been best to do the dragon head at the end, right before wrapping the thumb guard of the tail, rather than at the beginning. I generally avoided getting the head too hot while heating the tail or other elements of the sword, but am still a bit worried that the scale detail and sharpness of the ears and horns have been diminished from excess heat. I also added no scales to the tail, since I assumed I would be hitting it with a hammer later in the process. However, I wound up wrapping the tail most effectively with a pair of pliers. Scales would be quite feasible. 2. balance the sword Sword balanced on my tongs at about 1”. Finally, I wish I had conducted a dimensional analysis of the sword at the beginning. When I finished the hilt and roughed out the blade, I realized the balance point was about 1” down the blade. I set up a
 
systems of equations ⁠ 05 of force and moment. hello, 2.001 However, my measurements were a bit rough. Since I had already forged the hilt, the best way I could get a measure of how much mass was in each part of the sword was by volumetric analysis via water displacement in graduated cylinders. This gave a degree of accuracy to 1mL, or 1g.  I would be able to get higher precision by weighing an unforged bar on a scale, then marking on the bar which section would be forged to a blade, which to the hilt, etc. This would have been vulnerable to other sources of error, however, such as loss of mass due to
 
oxidation. ⁠ 06 in the form of metal flakes that fall off your piece when you hammer it. Ultimately, the tip of the sword broke off during forging, so the balance point is still around 1”. All in all, I’m quite pleased with how the sword came out. The sword cuts through paper and cardboard, and I have to remind people not to touch the tip. I enjoyed learning how to use the hydraulic press, and I hope to employ both that and the power hammer into future projects, since they make many processes such as tapering and lengthening material much more efficient.  I am also excited to gain more skill with chisel work. The dragon head was my first three-dimensional chiseled sculpture, and I hope to design more expressive and dynamic monster heads in the future.

tl;dr it’s cool to explore interests completely different from what your high school self would’ve expected! After five semesters at MIT, two change of majors forms, and many advisor meetings initiated by emails with the subject line “help i don’t know what I’m doing with my life!!,” I’ve finally settled on an academic path that I’ll likely stick with! I am currently majoring in
 
6-9 ⁠ 01 Computation & Cognition, which is a joint major between computer science and brain & cognitive science. (I love telling people that 'i major in 6-9' for shits and giggles<br />
) 
2, ⁠ 02 mechanical engineering pre-MIT  In response to the application essay question “what department or program at MIT appeals to you,” I wrote:  Pursuing Course 6.3 and UROPing at the Media Lab or CSAIL will give me the tools and the collaborative environment to make my visions a reality.  I actually wrote 6.3 instead of 6-3. Thank you to whoever read my application for seeing past my blunder. I swear I had looked up an official MIT website of some sorts before writing this, but maybe I conflated majors with classes being floating point representations.  I had worked on a computer science research project that started as an independent inquiry, but later  got mentorship for it MIT THINK freshman year  As a freshman, I didn’t stray too far from my intended path. I picked up a
 
UROP ⁠ 03 undergraduate research opportunity program 
CSAIL ⁠ 04 computer science & artificial intelligence lab While I loved my UROP, the few major related classes I’ve taken up to that point just felt… unsatisfying. Definitely not in a “I’m too good for these classes they’re not rigorous enough for me lol” kind of way, since one of the first things I had to get used to at MIT was never completely understanding what’s going on in my classes. I was unsatisfied because something felt missing from my days of sitting in front of my laptop crunching numbers, latex, or code.  I’m an artist. I’ve always enjoyed making things with my hands. As a kid, that looked like hot gluing together anything I could get my hands on. Although my art practice eventually moved on to 2D media like painting and drawing, it was the physical connection between pencil and paper, brush and canvas that I continued to love. I’ve tried digital art here and there, first with a mouse and then a tablet without pressure sensitivity, but I couldn’t get past the physical disconnect.  Once MIT shipped out fancy iPads complete with a pressure sensitive Apple Pencil, that changed the digital art game for me. Because it appeared as if the motions of my hand were directly translated into digital brushstrokes of varying intensities, I was happy enough. Even if the Apple Pencil couldn’t completely emulate the slight bounce and twang of a paintbrush moving pigmented water across coarsely textured paper, drawing on an iPad required way less setup than preparing a traditional painting. Alas time is scarce at MIT. The cookie tin full of paints I brought with me to MIT sat idle as I hatched away on my iPad.  On top of all of my academic and artistic pursuits involving staring at screens, covid restrictions made it so that very few in person, hands-on activities were permitted during my freshman year. I just wished to be that kid recklessly hot gluing things together again. Lucky for me, one of the few things that were happening were trainings at the Metropolis Makerspace! I learned how to 3D print and lasercut something for the first time. Lasercutting files require vector formats, and I’ve made a ton of vector graphics for my high school clubs, so that was something I could immediately get into. I spent a lot of my free time that semester lasercutting boxes and knick knacks with increasingly ornate designs.  sophomore fall   As sophomore year started approaching, I thought a lot about how much I enjoyed being in the makerspace, making physical objects that were beautiful. What if I also learned how to make things that were functional? That  worked ? I considered ‘relying’ on my UROP as my source of passion for computer science, but why should I take classes that I knew I wouldn’t completely like, when I could be taking classes that I’d actually enjoy? Later during East Campus’s REX fort construction, I learned how to use an impact driver, a chop saw, and a decking screw gun, another empowering experience.  Feeling inspired by  Amber’s blog about declaring course 2A , I filled out my first change of major form two weeks before the beginning of sophomore fall.  Switching to
 
2A ⁠ 05 one of the two mechanical engineering degree programs, 2A in particular has a set of mechanical engineering requirements and a concentration requirement that basically lets any 6 classes focused on a particular area (ex. bioengineering, computer science, etc) count towards graduation sophomore spring Finally time for 2.007! 2.007 was what one might call a “lifestyle class.” I’d sleep earlier in order to wake up early to use the machines before they got crowded and squeeze in machine shop hours whenever I could, culminating in an average of 15-20 hours spent on that class per week. Beyond 2.007 simply being a demanding class, part of why I poured so many hours into it was that I felt behind in comparison to my peers, most of whom had done high school robotics. My high school had a great robotics team that I didn’t join.  But the other reason of why I was so willing to schedule my life around 2.007 was that I genuinely enjoyed making something physical with my hands— I got to see how 2.001 concepts translated into real life practice, tighten screws at inconvenient locations, feel the force of a lathe bit cut into a piece of aluminum spinning at 700 rpm. Even though I came in with little practical experience, I ended the class having learned how to use most of the once intimidating machines in the shop. And that was so immensely empowering.  I also took 2.678 Electronics for Mechanical Systems, whose final project was to code a bot that followed a lined path as quickly and accurately as possible. The instructor also gave us the liberty of throwing away either objective to just make something “cool.” So my partner Tiffany ’24 and I wrote up a reinforcement learning algorithm called Q Learning. The robot learns a lookup table of decisions (turn left, turn right, go forward) based on various states (reflectance sensor readings). Although our robot was very slow and struggled with tight turns due to the limited storage capacity of an Arduino, we were commended for being the first team in the history of the class to teach the robot how to learn, rather than than how to follow a line. My ex-course 6 self was excited that my background knowledge actually came in handy in a MechE classroom. Our robot, affectionately named “Head Thoughts” short for No Thoughts Head Empty, trying to learn how to follow a line. She’s struggling a bit but she’s got the spirit. Our prof said that he’d be impressed if our bot would follow a curve of any diameter. We are very proud of Head Thoughts for her valiant efforts. Sorry for the choppiness; I had to compress this gif a lot to get it to upload :'( junior spring  Come junior year, I was hit by the realization, “Dude you should actually figure out what you’re going to do with your life.” The truth was (and still is) that I’m much more employable in computer science than in mechanical engineering. I could actually give thoughtful answers to computer science interview questions and wax poetic about my research experiences.  Everyone at career fairs, no matter what industry, wanted a machine learning (ML) person. There was a power tool company wanting someone to apply ML to power tools, a waste management company who wanted someone to apply machine learning to waste management, you get the point. I even applied to a sensors company explicitly stating that I wanted to work on something that wasn’t ML because I wanted to try something new, and proceeded to get an offer to work on ML.  I’m thankful to be employable in the first place, and I’m proud of myself for getting to a point where getting pigeonholed into ML jobs is a “problem.” It just meant that I was once again at a crossroads, wondering if I should switch back to 6-9 to get better at what I already know well or fully commit myself to course 2A.  Since I was significantly behind on 2A graduation requirements in comparison to 6-9, I decided that I didn’t want the stress of wondering if I can graduate on time. 6-9 had enough flexibility to also let me explore a bit of hardware and electrical engineering. I’ve previously avoided these areas since I thought
 
electrical engineering = circuits ⁠ 06 </span>EE is in fact so much more than just circuits :o  and I didn’t like the circuits part of
 
8.022. ⁠ 07 Physics II: Electricity & Magnetism, which satisfies one of the physics general institute requirements So I meandered back to 6-9 and added a course 2 minor.  now Hindsight is telling me that maybe I should’ve declared 2A or

small talk topics. ⁠ 09 I love talking about how babies are smart and AI is stupid though. Anyways, this blog was a long winded way to say that it’s perfectly normal for you to come out of high school wanting one thing and realizing down the road that you want something else. This makes sense especially for fields like nuclear engineering, which are relatively harder to get exposure as a high school student. It may not look like my path has deviated much on paper since I’m still a course 6-9, but I never thought I’d spend so many of my nights CADing instead of debugging
 
segfaults. ⁠ 10 infamous GPU error sthat don't tell you what went wrong, so fixing these are a pain an arcade ticket dispenser I made for fun! I learned how to SLA print, cut chamfers on a lathe, design T slots for holding together an acrylic box, drive a stepper motor, and hold myself together when things didnt fit together and I had to remake a few parts :’). thank you to Winnie ’24 for supplying the electronic parts (including not one but two stepper drivers because I blew one up) and to Juliana ’24 for supplying shaft collars. As for exactly what I want to do after graduation? I’m still not sure and should figure that out fast. I’m fairly sure that I want to pursue a PhD sometime in the near future since I love research in an academic setting, but whether I want to do this immediately after graduation and exactly what topics I want to investigate remains an open question. Hopefully I’ll narrow down my options through a new UROP this spring or maybe through a summer opportunity. For now, I’m okay with this uncertainty.  #2.007 #I'm still course 6 #not super major major crisis

This semester I took 21W.790[J] Short Attention Span Documentary, taught by Professor Vivek Bald. Learning to make videos was a goal of mine for 2022. I love photography and writing, and video is a nice marriage of visuals and storytelling. But, once the summer came along, and I was no closer to achieving it, I realized that I would need some  
external motivation, ⁠ 01 deadlines and grades The class is structured as a workshop where the majority of the semester is dedicated to viewing and critiquing students’ videos. We were assigned to one of five screening groups at the beginning of the semester and presented our videos on the  assigned date.  First Assignment: Portrait of a Person or a Place In this first assignment, your goal will be to convey to your audience in a 90-120 second segment of video, a clear and compelling sense of a person or a place. Your main constraint, beside the time limit, is that, while you may use audio from interviews, you may not include “talking head” interview footage. When I first read the assignment description, I wanted to do the assignment on my aunt who lives in Boston. A couple of weeks prior she had shared a part of her life story, one about music and immigration and young dreams. But she left to visit Ethiopia for about a month, so I couldn’t record her before the video’s due date. My next thought was to focus on a place, the MIT chapel. During my freshman year, I overheard a tour guide talk about how services of all religions were conducted in the church, which I found inspiring and wanted to center my video on that. But after some digging, I learned that the church was just non-denominational, which is still interesting but not as uniting as I had originally thought. Plus there were these large white tents on the Kresge lawn that obstructed a clear shot of the chapel from afar.  At this point, I had maybe two weeks until the video was due, and still didn’t have a subject. I was ranting about it to my friends, and then it hit me. I could do a portrait of one of my friends, and thankfully Bukunmi was happy to do it. I had a preliminary meeting with her to get her overall life story and see what themes and narratives jump out. From that, I compiled a list of interview questions and met with her again. This time I brought out my mic and recorder, and we had a 45-minute long interview.   Bukunmi made everything so easy. Her voice is both firm and soothing. She answered my every question clearly and thoroughly. Of course, cutting down 45 minutes to 2 minutes was difficult but it wasn’t hard because she hit all the points I was hoping she’d say. The harder part was filming the b-roll so that it aligned with what she was saying. Bukunmi and her friends were very patient with me as I followed her around recording them. And the result~      Making this video was a first for many things: using my camera for video, using a mic and a recorder, recording in log, figuring out color grading, finding background music that matches the tone of the video, using premiere pro, and so much more. But, whatever fear kept me from starting videos, maybe fear of failure or struggle, was ripped off during the process. Just looking at all the features of Premiere Pro used to scare me, but starting with this small project allowed me to become familiar with it and shed my fear.  Second Assignment: Issue, Problem, Opinion This assignment is a bit more wide open, but potentially more complex. Your goal will be either: a )to introduce your audience in 3-5 minutes to the multiple sides of an issue or problem, i.e.: to lay an issue out for your audience members in a straightforward or neutral way, as short news items ostensibly do; or b) to introduce your audience in 3-5 minutes to an issue or problem and take a clear stance on that issue, i.e.: to produce an activist or advocacy video.  While I was working on the first video, my friend and next-door neighbor Abby shared a statistical figure that took me by surprise. 19 Black women graduated from MIT in 2020.  . 20 Black women graduated from MIT in 2022. I spend a lot of my time surrounded by Black women at MIT, and I guess it deluded me into believing there were more of us than there actually were. Seeing how little that number was, and seeing how I could name every single person was beyond shocking. I didn’t have a story or an idea, but I told Abby that I wanted to make my next video for this class investigating those numbers.  A few weeks go by and I try to get ready to start working on this assignment. I meet with Abby again to discuss what direction to take this video. Instead, Abby shared a conversation she had with her advisor after she told him the numbers. He told her that a lot of students and even professors of color feel laden with the responsibility to drive DEI initiatives in their organizations or offices. Though this work to ensure equity and inclusion is paramount for everyone, people of color especially feel a sense of ‘if I don’t do it, who will?’ At the same time, Abby’s advisor brought up a corollary that neither Abby nor I had previously considered. The time that people of color pour into these initiatives isn’t free. It doesn’t help with tests. It doesn’t advance careers. It certainly doesn’t add opportunities to rest and recuperate, limited as they are. And those who aren’t invested in leading and working towards these initiatives have this time to dedicate to studying for tests, advancing careers, resting. And the already existing gap widens even further.  After this conversation, I knew I had the perfect topic. As for my subject, I asked Nicole, the current political action co-chair of the Black Student Union, whose room is conveniently right across mine. Like with my first project, I had a preliminary call with Nicole and Myles, the other BSU co-chair. They shared in great detail the pressure of being chair, the legacy of the BSU, and the struggles of working with the administration. That call helped me realize that I had stumbled upon a wealth of stories, pain points, and narratives. It also made it harder to pick one narrative. In the end, I focused on Nicole’s relentless work, very much unlike the administration’s fickle stance, and the impact it has on her and Black students.  The making of this video was significantly harder than the last. There was so much important information to include from my hour-long interview. Cutting it to five minutes seemed impossible. Moreover, unlike the first video, this interview included both audio and video, which I recorded separately with my mic and camera respectively. I did this to enhance the quality of the audio as the one the camera comes with isn’t great, but that meant I had two things to keep track of as I was also interviewing. There was also the case of setting up lighting and positioning for an interview. Also, what does b-roll for a topic on racism look like? Balancing all of this proved to be difficult, but I’m ultimately proud of the end result.   Third Assignment: Final Video In your final video, you will be expected to produce a slightly longer piece, roughly 5-7 minutes, that combines aspects of both the previous assignments, eg: a piece that both creates a portrait of a place and explores an issue related to that place; a portrait of a person that also puts forward a point of view on an issue; etc. I didn’t know what I wanted to do my video on for a long time. I knew that I didn’t want to do it on something MIT-related and that I wanted it to be pretty. I thought I’d find a dancer or an artist to profile, but what would the ‘issue’ be? I deliberated for long–too long–until suddenly it was less than a week and a half before the rough draft was due. I decided that it’d be easy if I was the subject. I would do a video on balancing creativity and expression in a technical institute. But even though doing a video on myself would give me absolute control over when to record and what I would say, it would’ve been harder to record the b-roll and other footage, and I wanted a video that was pretty at the very least. Then I thought of other people I could talk to on the topic of expression and creativity, and Sienna was first in mind.  Still, I didn’t have an idea what the ‘issue’ would be, so I asked Sienna to get dinner with me and talk about what the central issue could be. Many themes came up: being a stud, wearing masculine and feminine clothing, being misgendered. I learned so much during that dinner and decided then my final project would be about her. I interviewed her a week later and the day after that presented a seven-minute rough cut of our fifty-minute interview. I wasn’t proud of it though. My rough cut was primarily focused on her relationship with her clothes and their relation to her interests, gender, and sexuality. It was no doubt interesting and meaty, but what I really wanted to explore was the breadth of Sienna’s expression. She is unabashedly herself in everything she does, be it her room, clothes, hair, tattoos, and jewelry. It is what I most admire about her, what makes her different from so many people on this campus and beyond. But expression as an ‘issue’ felt like it couldn’t compare to something like queer identity, a subject that is immediately treated with gravity. I shared my frustration with the class and was surprisingly met with encouragement to pursue this other topic. And so I did.  Final Thoughts In the end, this class helped me achieve my goals. I made videos and started to learn how to use my photography equipment for video as well as edit through Premiere Pro. Besides screening a few short documentaries towards the beginning of the semester and a few lectures on shooting video and editing, this class was mostly focused on learning by doing, and I learned a lot, to say the least.   Above all, it made me realize that making videos has so many components. I never thought it was easy but damn. I totally understand why movie credits are ten minutes long. I was lucky to be filming friends, so I could be unprofessional and make mistakes as I balanced my roles as an interviewer, camerawoman, audio mixer, editor, and more. I also struggled a lot with the b-roll and trying to figure out whether to be literal or symbolic. In watching videos now, I definitely notice the variety of angles used to sustain the audience’s attention. If the range of angles and b-roll are the backbone of video content, the unsung hero is background music. I took for granted how large a role it plays in setting the mood for any scene or video. Finding background music that aligned with the tone of my videos was a truly difficult task.         Given all that, I’m happy with the videos I’ve made given that they were the first three videos I’ve ever intentionally worked hard to produce. I’m grateful to this class for giving me the opportunity to learn and create as well as receive thoughtful feedback from my peers. I know I have so much more to learn before I one day make videos that are seen by many others. I hope that this is only the start.

“This is it,” I thought as I submitted my last college essay. “I’ve written everything there is to write. I am never writing another word of English – especially not at (hopefully) MIT!” Boy, was I wrong. (Thankfully, not about the “at MIT” part.) As part of MIT’s  general institute requirements , all undergraduates take four “communication-intensive” (CI) classes during their time at MIT. Two are humanities classes, and the others relate to their majors. The requirement’s purpose is to make us more effective writers and orators. A large part of that comes from exposing us to new forms of writing. This past semester, I took
 
one-and-a-half ⁠ 01 3.010 and 3.020 each counts as a half CI-M because of course 3 lore reasons Assignment 1 – A White Paper (3.010) In true MIT fashion, the first assignment was also the most daunting. The prompt was to write a white paper about one of three topics from the perspective of a MIT.nano or industry researcher: Using transmission electron microscopy to characterize strained-silicon devices. Using neutron diffraction to characterize unknown sodium-ion battery materials. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the surface structures of electrocatalysts used in oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. Immediately, I had several questions on my mind: What is a “white paper”? What do they mean by “characterize”? What do these big words even mean? “X-ray photo-” what now? Or, more succinctly: What. I chose the first prompt because it seemed the most straightforward and familiar, but I had no idea where to start. After all, semiconductor physics is the domain of 3.033 (electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials – typically a junior-year class). I was initially tempted to submit a blank sheet of printer paper – it  is  technically a white paper, after all – but luckily, the 3.010 teaching staff had put together a list of review papers to help us find our bearings. They also answered my question about what a white paper should be; essentially, it’s a short paper outlining a complex issue (the end of Moore’s law in this case) and proposes/discusses a path forward to address that problem (and hopefully secure funding too). Within a few days of staring at diffraction patterns, I had a vague idea of how to structure (no pun intended) my paper. As with many writing assignments, the biggest challenge for me was to set the ball rolling. The prompt was intimidating because it felt like I needed a lot of background knowledge to write coherently. I quickly realized that the paper’s focus should be on how characterization gives us useful information (which we did learn in 3.010) rather than the underlying physics of strained silicon. Overall, I was happy with how this assignment turned out. I learned a lot – both about modern semiconductor technology and technical writing – and the time I spent on my first draft afforded me a relatively light revision process. My only complaint is the font requirement (Times New Roman 🤮). Assignment 2 – A Critical Summary (24.900) This was the most straightforward of the five assignments because of its similarity to my past high-school essays. The prompt was direct and unambiguous: Read  The Atoms of Language  by Mark Baker. Summarize one of the claims he made and the arguments for it. Evaluate how convincing those arguments were. At 1000 words, this was also the shortest of the five assignments. One surprising thing about the assignment was how we could evaluate the arguments by both the facts laid out in the book and how the author uses rhetoric. After all, it’s not a very strong argument if it’s so technical that the average reader can’t even understand what it’s saying. Assignment 3 – An Analytical Sketch (24.900) This assignment was a bit traumatizing because of how long it was (3000 words!), so here’s the TL;DR to compensate: I chose a language (Montenegrin) to analyze. I found a native speaker (
 
my friend Matija ‘25 ⁠ 02 Shoutout to him for tolerating an hour of my painful mispronunciations of Montenegrin words I used those words and sentences to create a basic guide to Montenegrin morphology, syntax, and phonology using what we learned in 24.900. Of course, my descriptions were often overly simplified (especially my phonology section) because I had so little data to work with, but luckily that wasn’t the point of the assignment. Instead, it was meant to show us how linguists document new languages and form working hypotheses. Assignment 4 – A Poster Presentation (3.010) This assignment was by far the most fun. I had to make a poster about the structure of a “mystery material”, given its x-ray diffraction (XRD) data, and then deliver a 7-minute oral presentation to the class. I always see many poster presentations plastering the walls of MIT, so it was exciting to make one myself. My mystery material was  lithium cobalt oxide  (LCO), used in lithium-ion batteries; others got materials like  cadmium telluride ,  hematite , and  fool’s gold . I was extremely lucky to get LCO, which made this assignment a lot easier than it normally would be: It’s a well-studied material, so there was no ambiguity when matching up my XRD data to that from the literature. Its geometry leads directly to its material properties (unlike cadmium telluride), so I had much to talk about without needing too much background information. Describing and visualizing its structure was also straightforward  (unlike hematite), so I didn’t need to spend too much time on that. Lithium-ion batteries are everywhere, so I had plenty of real-world applications at my disposal. Most importantly, its hexagonal structure matched the ✨aesthetics✨ of my intended poster design. Then came the fun part – putting it all together. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then my poster is worth approximately 13,584 words. I made my poster resemble the  Department of Materials Science and Engineering’s website  because it has a neat background graphic that I wanted to include (plus, it’s my favourite shade of blue). My biggest challenge was fitting everything I needed into such a small space while keeping all the figures legible.
 
Eventually, my work culminated in a poster that I still have hanging in my room today ⁠ 03 I wanted to embed the poster in this post but WordPress isn't having it today 🙁 Assignment 5 – A Research Proposal (24.900) The final assignment of 24.900 was an extension of the analytical sketch. I had to review that previous paper, find an “interesting” feature of Montenegrin, and then propose a research project to collect more data and explain that feature. Given my sparse data, I expected to be grasping at straws trying to find such a feature, much less proposing a hypothesis explaining it! By some stroke of luck, there was a specific exception concerning verb conjugations that I could just barely explain using what I learned in the class. It seemed too simple to be true but was good enough for my purposes. (I later asked Matija about the hypothesis, and he immediately listed ten verbs that contradicted it; such is the nature of research, I suppose.) This assignment had an oral component too, where we gave condensed three-minute “elevator pitches” of our research proposals. Fortunately for those with stage fright, we didn’t have to deliver these speeches in front of everyone, but instead within small groups in our recitations. Next semester, I’ll be taking 3.155 (micro/nano processing technology) and

I took two classes at Harvard! I wrote down my  first impressions I took   for the fairies and witches element, but I learned so much more. Irish folklore is quite vibrant and diverse. We learned Daniel O’Connell, a well-loved historical figure who has been raised to mythical proportions. We also dipped into the Fenian Cycle, stories about the hero Finn mac Cumhaill, famous across all of Ireland. I love this type of legend cycle, where there are many overlapping, sometimes contradictory tales, such that there is no singular canon, and the sum of parts is always greater than the whole. I gained a much deeper understanding of not just the mythical understanding of the Fae — which has become a common archetype in many fantasy and YA novels — but also witches and fairies in medieval and industrial society. The concept of the Fae was used to grieve loved ones, ie a mother that died in childbirth would be said to have been taken by the fairies to nurse a fairy child. But the Fae were also to ostracize individuals that society deemed unworthy — witch trials are a clear example. That juxtaposition is so interesting to me and definitely something I hope to explore further.  was probably the best writing workshop I’ve been in. The professor set out the guidelines of workshop right way: we were to first discuss the strengths of the story, then address a list of questions the author had prepared, which mostly translated to aspects of the story which could be improved. Finally, the author came up with a few extra questions on the spot, which we also delved in to. I’ve never recevied such harsh but simultaneously useful feedback. It was also lovely to be in a space where I could see my impressions of my peers’ work reflected by others. We were learning how to make our own work better by examining the flaws and strengths in each others’ writing. I’ve been in workshops where it felt difficult to address flaws directly, for fear of hurting the author’s feelings; in contrast, this atmosphere allows us to pick apart the flaws deeply, in a way that still respected the value of the writing.  This was also my first explicitly genre-focused class. I enjoyed that immensely since the needs for genre and literary writing are different. Everyone here focused on genre-specific elements, like pacing and plot arc, as well as universal writing elements, such as development of characters and setting.  I also met another MechE student at MIT who writes adult fantasy, which was a wonderful surprise! Her heist story was solid; it read like something you’d take off the shelf. woodcut of banshee under a tree; the banshee mythos was one of my favorite things to learn Harvard classes on the whole were harder than MIT HASS classes. This is partially due to my own preconceived notions: I came to Gaelic Folklore expecting to do more work, so I completed a greater portion of the readings than I have at any MIT class. However, they also graded more harshly. I received my first B on a college essay in that class, and their feedback was relevant and insightful — here’s to hoping I did better on the final essay. In these two classes, I read about 100-200 pages per week. Half of that was fiction, which is easier than the academic papers I’ve had assigned each week in sociology and anthropology classes at MIT. On the other hand, I paid more attention to the fiction since it was written by my peers, and I wanted to pay respect to their work and the ethos of the writing workshop. I can safely say that I spent more hours reading this semester than any semester prior, and absorbed the content far better. fairy by Johann Heinrich. Legends of the Fae, originating in Ireland and Scotland, have spread across the globe the  was actually fairly inconvenient. In the morning, there are often delivery trucks parked in the bike lane to offload produce, so you have to swerve directly into the streets. The bike lane is quite narrow compared to the luxuriously wide ones in Denmark and other parts of Europe. All told, there were many days I simply felt too tired to deal with the stress of biking in traffic, so I took the bus instead. The bus is frequently late, meaning the arrival window is ~15 minutes, so it would take 20-40 minutes to travel the single mile to Harvard. I guess this is standard in American cities, and is the best way for many to commute to work or school. My peers who live across the river certainly make it work. Coming from a city where I drove six miles to school in 15 minutes, the long commute felt burdensome. However, I think I will shoulder the commute again — just ideally not four days per week. Celtic harp, traditionally played with fingernails (though playing with the fingers was popularized over a century ago) These classes also pushed me to take advantage of  , which I don’t typically do. At the behest of my writing professor, I checked out a few short story books with a similar second-person style to the piece I was writing. Having thus remembered that books are not only free but also can be read during the semester, I checked out some more for research for my Gaelic Folklore final. One of these was available as a digital loan, which was a welcome relief after finding that it wasn’t on libgen. Then, in a rush of power, I checked out books that had nothing to do with academics. MIT’s libraries let you borrow books for 60 days at a time! I’m taking  Stone Butch Blues  with me to Brazil over IAP
 
now. ⁠ 01 not reading it, though, I finished it while writing this blog The most valuable takeaway from classes at Harvard was  . On my last day of Gaelic Folklore, we set up a ceili and ate soda bread and shortbread cookies. Two grad students were discussing their master’s degrees in Ireland, and a senior shared her plans to study animal husbandry in Ireland for her gap year before applying for immigration and a master’s thesis. While there are people with diverse passions at MIT, most of us are deciding how to balance that passion with a career in STEM. This deep dedication to a humanities field was so different for me, and so welcome. My classmates in the writing workshop had equally diverse interests, all engineered towards pursuing a writing career in this tumultuous market. One pre-med student was taking a gap year to focus on writing and publishing before she went to med school. Another student had a degree in teaching and devoted summers to writing. There was also the MIT MechE major whose projected career path was not too different from mine. Several students in the workshop majored in English and devoted the majority of their time to reading and writing; but many others majored in engineering and science, and still incorporated writing into their lives. I’ve been toying with getting an

The consistent use of Gill Sans helps make RLE feel like a coherent part of MIT’s buildings, and helps distinguish it from other labs.

in 2022, I challenged myself to listen to an album every day. I thought this would be a good idea because I enjoy the entire process of listening to music: looking for new songs/albums, actually listening to them,  and organizing any noteworthy finds into one of my 150+ carefully curated Spotify playlists. I was, however, a bit hesitant about the prospect of consuming 365 new albums in a year. what if I found it tedious and fell 100 albums behind by June? would I   be able to devote time to listening to an album every single day? as a voracious playlist listener, I had my doubts. unrelated but…can we talk about this? AI-generated playlists are starting to freak me out there also was the issue of my last attempt at a New Year’s Resolution. in my junior year of high school, I devoured   a few days into the new year and had an epiphany that pleasure reading was the greatest thing ever, or something. having rediscovered my love for reading, I decided to embark on the Goodreads Reading Challenge, setting my goal at 120 books. I ended the year at a whopping 148. it was actually insane. looking back at the books I read, I see a lot that I remember vividly and still love:  . but there are a few that I consumed way too quickly and have a meager recollection of. I was so eager to check off my next conquest that I spent minimal time thinking about them, and as a result could you offer little more than a two-sentence synopsis. for example,  , a renowned tome that delves into the intricacies of how humans think, and  , which discusses mortality and aging in grisly detail, are incredible books that I have no choice but to reread someday. thankfully, listening to an album is a lot less committal than reading an entire book. you can, and often have to, listen to it more than once, anyways. that’s why I can reflect on my year of music with few regrets! so…let’s get one thing clear: I didn’t listen to an album  day. some days, I’d play catch up and would listen to 3-5. I tried to listen while showering, cooking, cleaning, or doing some similarly ambient activity. I did my best not to listen while studying or psetting, since it’s hard to focus on what you’re hearing if you’re in grind mode. sometimes, I couldn’t help it…there’s only so much ambient time in the life of an MIT student you might wonder how I found over 365 albums to listen to. surprisingly enough, it was easy; I had a backlog of several, asked my friends for recommendations, perused rateyourmusic.com and Reddit, and pored over dozens of Spotify playlists. the albums for my  Beatles class in terms of tracking music, I was too lazy to develop a rating system, so I’d just add a song I liked from the album to a playlist. if I ended up not liking an album, I wouldn’t bother adding a song. the playlist above has songs from my favorite albums. notice how there are 103 songs, which is 28% of the music of the year’s playlist! it seems like an overly high proportion of music to enjoy, but when I think about how often I’d select for genres and artists I like, it makes more sense. when I compare the playlist of my favorites to the playlist of all 365 songs, it’s interesting to see how similar the two are. I was expecting a skew towards certain genres in the shorter playlist, but it seems pretty representative! even in terms of mood, the two are quite alike: Popularity Happiness 54  /  Danceability Energy 65 Tempo 119/200   /  123/200 neo-psychedelic 3% 
rock 3% 
indie rock 3% 
art pop 2% 
indie garage rock 2% rock 4% 
neo-psychedelic 3% 
indie rock 2% 
rap 2% 
alternative rock 2% if any of this sounded interesting to you, you should give it a try. not all albums have to be two-hour long experimental projects you’d find on some niche r/music thread. listen to whatever makes you happy! would I do this again? definitely yes, but not this year—I’m a bit burnt out. I think I’ll aim for 150 or so. there’s so much music out there that I’m invigorated by the idea of hunting down 365 more albums, but for the sake of my sanity, I’ll save it for another year. I’ll be satisfied as long as I spend 2023 finding new music often! so…send your recommendations my way :)

Sadly, I did not come up with the title pun myself, I saw it on Twitter. Since my blogs do a decent job of encompassing how 2022 went for me, I won’t review the past year on here, but I made a  Substack post Someone asked me today what my 2023 resolutions were, and I responded, “Hard to say because I have so many flaws.” That’s a self-deprecating way to put it, but I do think it’s difficult to pare down all the ways I want to improve into a few goals. Like, I haven’t been eating well and barely exercise, and also my time management is a mess, and maybe I should branch out more socially, and probably I could study harder for my job interviews, and . . . Well, you get the point. Sort of wish I had the misguided self-confidence of Greg Heffley from  oh to possess this amount of self-confidence We should always strive to grow, right? Especially since I’m still in undergrad and so much of my life is ahead of me and like, if I had Greg’s attitude of “it’s hard for me to see how I could improve”, that would probably not bode well for my future. I don’t really remember if I had any resolutions in 2022, but in retrospect, I grew a lot in the previous year, and I feel much more grounded and clear-eyed. If I had to pinpoint the biggest change, I’d say I’ve become more emotionally mature, meaning I’ve been able to avoid a lot of drama because it turns out that most of it doesn’t matter, I’ve taken a lot more responsibility over my own life (including paying for my entire college tuition for the first time), and I have a better grasp on the actual stakes of a situation. Maybe for the first time ever, I feel like I have a solid vision of what my career will look like in the next several years and what I want out of life. In high school, I only really knew that I had some passions for math and writing, and that I wanted to get into a selective college. After I got to MIT, I floundered a lot and jumped from major to major; I considered being a consultant, a quant trader, a humanities PhD student, a full-time writer, etc. Now I’m pretty sure I want to pursue my computer science MEng here starting next fall, concentrating in systems, and eventually accept an engineering role in performance optimization and low-level systems. I still want to write professionally (and am contractually bound to publish two novels anyway), and one day I might want to get an MFA in fiction or screenwriting, but I’d like to get more life experience before doing that. I also wouldn’t be surprised if at some point in the next decade I start a company with my younger brother, who is on a gap year before starting at Stanford next year. We both always have a ton of entrepreneurial schemes . . . Also, for the first time, I’m starting to think about my health. I’m getting older, my body is changing, and it turns out I no longer have the rapid metabolism of my teens that meant I could eat whatever I wanted and never gain any weight. I don’t want to perpetuate diet culture on here, and to be clear, skinniness != health, but the number on the scale was the first indicator that maybe I need to start caring about what I’m eating and how much I’m exercising. Maybe instead of setting goals, I should think about what I want my life to look like on December 31st, 2023: Here’s to 2023!

Every year, I try to set aside a chunk of time to reflecting on the year. This is usually done in the form of setting New Year’s resolutions, but I figured I should doing something a little more intentional. A couple years (?) ago,  Paolo YearCompass So…let’s fill it out! I chose these dates somewhat haphazardly. As I looked at my Google Calendar, any event that evoked a strong emotion, I wrote down. This was a really fun exercise to do because I genuinely forgot that so many of these things happened Through this, I was able to realize that a lot of the events that felt “important” to me often were things to do with my interests or things to do with my friends and community. Seeing the physical health and mental health sections empty, along with the habits section, made me realize how little time I spent really dedicating myself to individual, alone-time self-care activities, or how those never were /calendar/ events, but rather things that I spontaneously decided to do. N/A N/A N/A …was going with my gut consistently and constantly, trusting how I felt about people and places. …was better understanding myself, my limits and expectations, and the person I want to be. was moving to San Francisco alone, despite knowing that it was going to be unpleasant and difficult. was finally getting a full-time job. was finally reaching closure with the past and finding it within myself to be kind. was deciding on an apartment with Raymond! I’m most proud of how I handled the summer, given all that happened, and my growth this semester. I didn’t realize I could grow to be so peaceful, or to look at the world with such optimism, and I’m really proud of myself for getting this far. Obviously I think the top of my list here is Raymond. He helped me a lot through some difficult times in the year, like during my summer breakdown, along with just major decisions in my life like decisions to apply to grad school, where to work, and of course, where to live. Another person I spent a lot of time with this semester is Kylee, who has huge influence in my life. I find that I can easily talk to Kylee about anything and she is able to voice her opinions on things so saliently. (I would also say that maybe Kylee and Eva are tied here because I talked to them both a lot about my various ups and downs this year.) Third, I would probably say all the Adults who helped me through the summer (namely my manager and mentor at my job, Petey, and my mom). It was a really difficult learning lesson for me, but I think I learned a lot and it’s something I’ll carry with me to the future. I’m really not sure who this would be. I would think maybe Kylee, Eva, and Raymond, but it feels kind of self-serving to think that you are a main influencer in someone’s life, so I’m a little hesitant. I wanted to focus a lot more on my hobbies this semester, but found that I wasn’t able to do that for a variety of reasons. I wanted to get better at guitar and paint more, in particular, but found that I broke my guitar in August and didn’t find enough time to paint. I also wanted this to be the year I really made my gains in lifting, but since I got sick on and off all fall semester, it feels like I’ve made steps backward rather than forward. I also wanted to read more, but kind of dropped the ball on that one, too. I’ve discovered that I’m capable of kindness. And also of love and being loved. I think I’ve always known I have the capacity to love a person, but taking so many major steps with Raymond showed me that I can be in these really intense, serious, committed relationships and still feel content in myself and my life. I think I also just accomplished a lot on my own this semester. I often think of myself to be the dumbest out of our friends, so it’s nice to remind myself that I  cool shit and I’m smart. I took some hard classes in the spring and was able to do well in them. I did well in my summer classes. I did some really fun creative classes this fall. I’m most grateful to my family and friends for all the support they’ve given me this semester — Emma, Eva, Kylee, Raymond, Aiden, Jeremy, Petey, Ceri, Kellen, Shweta, my mom, my Ninang, my cousin, and obviously way more people on this list that I’m forgetting. I’m also grateful for just the amount of opportunity given to me at MIT. So many of my accomplishments stem from the sole merit of being an MIT student and I’m so appreciative of the amount of people that support me, root for me, and vouch for me. Living in New York City for the first time with Raymond and realizing that this was the city I wanted to live in. Watching Everything Everywhere All at Once in March and feeling so moved by the movie, and also just all the good movies that came out in 2022 in general. My surprise party for my 20th birthday, when all my friends hid in my room while I was downstairs talking my friend’s ear off. I literally cried so much because I’ve always wanted a surprise birthday party but never got one. Going to Disney World with Julie, Lulu, and Kat. It was the first time I really felt the love of a sorority and understood what it was all for. I loved waking up at ass o’clock in the morning just for line drop and scurrying over to the Avatar ride. I loved losing my voice from screaming too hard for Goofy and having to whisper scream the rest of the four days. Outsidelands and really all of the concerts I went to this year (mainly my 5 Seconds of Summer concert where I caught Ashton’s drumstick, as well as my 1975 concert and My Chemical Romance concert). It’s incredibly cheesy, but concerts are where I feel the most excited about life and I love getting to go to so many. Getting my job offer in September. Learning how to sail and having the confidence to sail. Getting over my fear of ice skating and learning how to ice skate. (Okay, maybe learning is a bit of a stretch.) Long conversations with my work friends about anything and everything. Watching all the Twilight movies with my friends. Retreat in New Hampshire and watching Nathan For You episodes. Watching Bridgerton with Eva. Going to TwitchCon and meeting all of my favorite Twitch streamers. Also hanging out with Ethan at TwitchCon. Working out consistently and lifting the heaviest I’ve ever been able to lift. Getting multiple job offers for full-time positions. Entering my kindness era and feeling true stability and contentment. A lot of hard work went into all of these things. I’m really proud of myself for being so consistent and so dedicated to my goals. I think I sometimes forget how ambitious I am, and often label myself as someone who’s lazy. But looking back and seeing all the things I was able to do this year reminds me that I actually do have a bit of drive and fire within me. Reflection was also such a huge thing that went into it. I spent a lot of time asking myself what I  wanted in life, and while I still don’t have a super clear idea of what that quite is, I’ve got a lot of ideas of what I   want. The people I mentioned before! I really appreciate all the friends and mentors in my life for just letting me be so open with them about anything and everything. Surviving San Francisco. Navigating new friendship dynamics and coming back to a fall semester that was much more different than I initially imagined. Coping with my short fuse temper. San Francisco was a greatly needed challenge and I learned a lot about myself. I’m so thankful to my work friends that I made, namely Lina and Alex and Stefan, for being there for me during the entire shitshow. I leaned a lot into coping via YouTube and started my Dimension 20 phase around this time (which I’m so, so grateful for again because it rekindled my love for fantasy and playing pretend.) My work mentors, new and old. I received so, so much support from Eva, Kylee, and Raymond this fall and I’m so thankful to them for putting up with my bitching and whining. And of course, an extra shoutout to my therapist for helping me navigate all my issues. I used to believe that holding true to your values meant displaying them at all times, being loud and blunt about it. To just   things carelessly, without added thought. This summer, though, I realized that there’s a lot more nuance here. That my bluntness is both my greatest hindrance and helper and there are ways in which I can learn how to use it for good, rather than just being a loaded shotgun ready to go off. I’m learning that there are ways to be both respected   kind, that kindness is not a show of weakness. I’ve learned how to play the long game, what hills are worth dying on, and what battles are worth fighting. I think I’m angry at myself for still not being as “chill” as I would like to be. I’m still quick to anger and I’m not patient with people, and I wish I was more patient Raymond, /especially/ with Raymond since he gives me so much patience in my day to day. I have some really bad habits I want to break and I get angry at myself a lot for not getting rid of them yet, like the way I freak out when I lose things or when we’re running late. I also think I’m sometimes really harsh on my friends when I get in really bad moods and I wish I was able to mediate those feelings a lot easier. I also am somewhat disappointed in myself for being such a bad communicator, for dropping the ball on so many projects (UROPs, jobs, assignments, etc.) and not putting my best foot forward out of sheer laziness or dismissal sometimes. This summer, I spent a lot of time being angry and hurt and feeling wronged. And I think that these feelings could’ve resulted in a path where I held on to that anger and that hurt and hurt other people. But instead, it culminated in a way where I realized that I don’t want to spend my life continuing those cycles. So I’m really proud of myself for taking that step forward. I don’t think I’ll ever let go of the /sadness/ associated with what happened, because I think that sadness reminds me why I have to be kind. Using what I learned from the summer, I’m able to apply it to what happened in high school. I think this is the first full year where I can say I’m not angry about what happened. I may be sad, yes, but I think now that I have 4 years of separation from the events, I can say truthfully that I’m not angry at anyone involved and it was just a shitty experience all around. There was a point in my life where I was actively wishing them all harm, that I figured that if they died, it would make my life better, in fact. But now I realize that that’s a lot of evil and negative energy to hold on to, and I’m happy I’m letting it go. I think I also need to let go of the guilt I feel when it comes to relationships. I haven’t made a lot of good decisions in the past romantically, and I often feel a lot of regrets when I think about them. But I think it’s finally time I let go of these regrets and disappointments and focus on looking forward. poignant, eye-opening, wistful Do you feel like letting go? Despite everything I said, I think 2022 was such an incredibly successful year for me. I’m wrapping up my second to last semester at MIT with so many people by my side and I always get really emotional just thinking about how far I’ve come. I know people are absolutely sick of how nostalgic and pensive I get when it comes to my life, but I honestly think so much about how far I’ve come in such a short amount of time. 2022 was a year of independence for me. I started out in January feeling so stupid and small and unappreciated. I found myself constantly comparing myself to Raymond, not really understanding why he spent his time with me, or what I brought to the table in terms of skills and knowledge. But throughout 2022 I was able to learn so much about myself and my capabilities. I coded websites and performed so well in school and my jobs. I pushed myself and tried new things, putting aside my insecurities and worries. I sailed for the first time. I went ice skating. I hiked. I lived on my own. I wrote comic book scripts and documentaries. I traveled across the US. I found an apartment to live in for next year. I scored a full-time job and got into grad school. There’s so much to be thankful for and to be proud of, and though some parts of it really were hellish, 2022 has treated me well. 
Dare to dream big I get really nervous to post things publicly, especially when it comes to, like, hopes and aspirations. I’m scared I’m going to say something and then not follow through so I’m going to keep this private. Substack My physical appearance. My loudness. My quirks that make people think I’m a little weird sometimes. Fear of looking dumb/stupid, fear of being wrong about things, insecurity over my appearance. Making a piece of furniture for my apartment. Getting good evaluations in my workplace. Adopting a dog in 2023. Raymond, my mom, Kylee/Eva/Emma/Aiden. Moving into a more permanent place (in a city I don’t know super well!!). How to navigate adulthood. (I know it’s not three, but figured these two things are so chunky, they’re basically three.) Peer pressure. Insecurity. Self-doubt. Books! So many books. Investing in more art and drawing more art to decorate my space with. DIY furniture and decor. Write my agenda for the day. Skincare routine always, and wear your sunscreen!!! Oh and take my Vitamin C gummies :’) Massages! I would love to get more massages in 2023. More media! More movies, more books, more graphic novels, more everything. Self-dates! Painting more, walks around the park, going out to museums. Spain! Korea! Japan! Making sure to regularly call and text my mom. Coming home for the holidays. Buying people things if it reminds me of them. I would love to have a keyboard in the apartment (although I’m not sure where I’ll put it..). A new acoustic guitar has always, always, always been on the radar. Oh, and building a new gaming computer. replying to people. Just reply to them! The moment you open a message, literally just fucking reply!!! As soon as people make plans with you, just write it down!! my friends and ambitions and   ambitions. Always driven by the people around me. Putting good energy into something. I graduate. It’ll be scary and it’ll be difficult, but I will get through it!!!! This is not the end!! opportunities to try new things come knocking at my door. really, really be intentional with my time. Don’t bite off way more than you can chew. Keep going at a steady pace and don’t worry about what other people are doing. You’re doing just fine. you’re graduating, bitch!!! This is it!! This is your final year before you do that young adult-ing thing all on your own!!! It’s you with the world, babe!!!!!!!!!! intention Not so secret if I post it to the admissions blogs for everyone to read, huh? what i listened to as i did this: happy new year <3 #but take my oversharing anyway!!! #this is so personal and literally does not mean anything to a lot of people

recently i looked through a list of all my friends who graduated from college recently, and i realized that all of them seem less interesting to me now than they did while they were in school i have a bad habit where i’m attracted to uncertainty. blog ideas and unfinished drafts usually feel better than complete posts because the process of completion removes uncertainty, and in doing so shrinks the realm of possibility for how good a post can be. i am optimistic by nature, so whenever i’m working on a half-finished project i tend to assume a positive outcome for the part i have yet to finish, and as a result i am usually discontent afterwards i think this is actually a pretty common bias. it’s closely related to why people are often disappointed when they achieve their dreams, and why many people have commitment issues (i don’t think i do, but i empathize with the state of mind of not wanting to commit because you’re worried about missing out on better options that may not even exist) last summer i was working at a startup whose focus was to build infrastructure to make ai systems as efficient as possible. afterwards my boss told me they were pivoting away from developing the infrastructure, and their new focus would be using their existing infrastructure to make user-facing ai products, the first of which was a code generation tool. my initial reaction was  “you have some of the best ai infrastructure in the world and could build any ai-powered product, and the best thing you could come up with was code generation?”  it wasn’t until much later that i realized maybe i was being a bit unfair; i probably would’ve had a similar reaction regardless of what direction they settled on one related idea i often think about is the concept of “beginner gains” in the context of learning. that is to say, if you’re a curious person with an open mind, you can convince yourself that practically any subject is interesting while you’re in the initial stages of learning that subject. this happens because, when you’re a beginner, you’re mostly learning generalities and new abstractions, which are usually pretty enjoyable to reason about; it’s only much later that you confront the reality of what it’s like to wrestle with a field, to have to memorize page after page of granular definitions or to spend hours working through tedious calculations or to conduct experiments that proceed glacially. learning is always fun when it’s done at a high level with few details attached; it’s only after you get past the beginner phase and are studying something fairly specific that you can determine how much you truly enjoy thinking about a subject it’s not always the case that specific outcomes are less appealing than uncertainty though. once in a while you encounter something which is so far out-of-distribution that it surpasses your imagination, something so incredible that if you described it to someone who didn’t already know about it and then showed it to them they would be more impressed by the thing itself than by its description. i’ve written about this idea  before  in the context of meeting new people – that some people are so much more competent in an area than you that their work is indistinguishable from magic – but occasionally you’ll also find outlier products or ideas or art (for me some examples in these categories include the internet,  cantor’s diagonalization argument , and  bojack horseman  respectively) when i was first writing this post i thought the takeaway was going to be that certainty is always less attractive than uncertainty, and therefore you shouldn’t feel bad if your life turns out to be significantly more dull than you had envisioned. then i thought about the magicians i know and realized this probably isn’t the right conclusion to draw. i think it’s important to recognize that magicians exist and you can do extremely interesting things if you want to, but also that interestingness is overvalued and a lot of important work is quite dull. a lot of education work is just ordinary teaching and curriculum development, a lot of ai research is just scaling and fine-tuning existing research, a lot of climate work is relatively routine materials science and policy work, and so on. maybe it was always inevitable that i’d become a boring adult

playlist This semester was rough. This sort of sentence has been one I’ve had trouble saying throughout my time at MIT. Some semesters go by better than others, but at this point the number of rough ones about equals the number of purely good ones, which is honestly an okay ratio in my opinion. Especially at a school known for the  
firehose. ⁠ 01 the feeling of being overwhelmed by classes, clubs, extracurriculars, life, etc. But this semester in particular, was rough. Because about halfway through, I felt like I was drowning. And hardly anyone knew. — Way earlier in the semester I had asked my mom if I should spend the extra money to fly home the day after my last final instead of waiting just one more day, and she said yes. So I flew home on the 23rd. On the flight, I thought back to last winter. Around this time last year, I was writing about how I was doing fun things to keep my mind off of finals and having a really good time with friends. I went to the movies, I waded in the Boston Harbor, I walked the esplanade not once or twice but three times. I was at ease. This year, I felt like I had one foot out the door. I studied hard for the biology exam right up until the last minute, and passed with a  
C-, ⁠ 02 woo! My flight was at 7am the next day, but I left for the airport at 3:30am. I couldn’t bear the feeling of my room anymore. I was ready to be at home and to try and do anything but schoolwork. The rain was pouring as the flight took off. I picture the rain water submerging the plane creating a flying submarine. And I fell asleep. — When things were at their worst this semester, I talked to a few trusted people in my life about what I needed to do next for my physical and mental health. Nearly everyone emphasized the fact that MIT would still be here when I came back,  
though it might seem different. ⁠ 03 Note: here I mean the time I took off for an in-person hospitalization, but taking time for mental health can look like many things in college. It can look like taking a semester off, doing an intense outpatient program while continuing classes, and it can look like my case which was simply an in-person inpatient hospitalization that lasted for a week, and then I came back and continued my classes. And these are just the ones *I* know about personally.  about these services. What I was asking these people for, was   to take advantage of them. That– the permission that is– they gave me. They told me I was brave. They told me they were proud of me for getting help. Which at first felt really patronizing. Why should I be “brave” for using resources that MIT provides? After getting the help from these resources, I finally understood why, at least a little bit: getting help is a bit of a leap of faith. You are trusting another person enough to say “I can’t do this on my own right now,” and hoping they will do the right thing by you. Because when I reached out, I was a little bit scared of what would come next. If I would be able to finish the semester or if I’d have to complete it later. If I would be able to give my final presentation. If I’d be sunk in medical debt. If I’d be ostracized for being “weak”. But the people I reached out to   fought for me and with me. And I made it  through In hindsight, I wish I hadn’t let myself reach the point of feeling so scared. — In the months leading up to coming home, my mom asked me to make a list of things I wanted to do in California. The list I made included some of the various food and (singular) coffee place in Fresno I had been craving for the past seven months, a haircut, and a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. A month or two into the fall semester of my junior year, the Class of 2024 got to go on the freshman aquarium trip. By which I mean, the aquarium trip that we would’ve gone on as first years, which wasn’t plausible given COVID etc., had finally transpired my junior year. I was so pumped to go. I love aquariums. I love being able to sit and see nothing but a wall of water and just catch your breath. But this was because I was used to the Monterey Bay Aquarium with a 1.2 million gallon tank called “The Open Sea”. An entirely dark room with a single tank taking up the entirety of one truly ginormous wall. This sort of behemoth of an aquarium, simply doesn’t exist at the New England Aquarium. It’s really nice, but it isn’t a “get lost in the silence of your mind” kind of nice, for me at least. But worst of all– after the aquarium trip– as I walked through the dark Boston streets, for the first time at MIT I felt  truly alone — On the way to Monterey, I made this  playlist  movie, in which the titular Percy is sitting with ease at the bottom of the pool. At first, the scene reminded me of my rough semester– the feelings of drowning, isolation, and “just pushing through”. But then, the scene started to feel calm. He just looks so peaceful in that scene. Percy knows that he’s under a lot of pressure. He knows he’s under water. Yet he’s just existing. — After I received the “permission” to get help, I felt like I could exist a little bit easier knowing I’d have help. And sitting in front of The Open Sea, my headphones replacing the noise of the crowd with my playlist, I feel ready to start existing more next semester. #aquarium #i am drowning but i do not know how to help myself

This semester I took seven classes —
 
72 units, ⁠ 01 typically classes are 12 units each, so an average semester is 48-60 units, or 4-5 classes Then there is a section of what I wanna do next semester! This blog is a sine wave of academic and personal thoughts so enjoy the whirlwind, mates.  – downvote :( I learned a lot from each class, and don’t specifically regret taking any of them. However, in total, 72 units was too many. I skipped most of my technical lectures because my HASS classes all had mandatory attendance, so technicals were the only place to carve time out of my schedule. I learned the content during the psets, which would have gone more smoothly if I did the psets during daylight hours. I had one pset due at 9 am, and over the course of the semester, I finished it later and later. First it was done at 10pm the night before, then 12 am, then 1… The final night I turned it in at 6 am and promptly went to sleep. This wasn’t a great use of time, either, since I had classes from 10am-5pm the next day, and I was more or less a zombie for that. Speaking of which, very important and i didn’t get much of it 🙁   — learned a lot :D other important things include saving this cookie for Selena I mention this in another blog, but I did nearly all of my readings this semester! I was in a writing workshop that assigned 60-100 pages of fiction per week, on average (the first month we read one book per week, circa 200 pages). My Celtic Folklore class had about 10-70 pages per week, so all told, I read ~100 pages every week. I really enjoyed this, since it meant I knew what was going on in my Harvard classes. I plan to prioritize readings in the future, since although doing so may mean taking fewer classes, it also guarantees that I absorb more content from each class I take. I felt like I was expanding my knowledge of wordcraft and folklore, and ended the semester with new ideas for my existing stories and a concept for a new story! I’m not sure I’ll be able to do this every semester, but I enjoyed doing it now. I took a few classes out of the typical order, and as such didn’t spend as much time psetting with my cohort. At the 2.009 presentations, a friend said, “Where have you been?” “Oh, around,” I said. “I put off 2.671, but I’ve been taking blacksmithing!” Last year, before sophomore spring, I had three core meche classes to check off: 2.005, Thermo I, hard; 2.086, MatLab for MechEs (actually titled Numerical Computations or somethin’), kinda hard for those new to coding; and 2.003, Dynamics, less hard. I was taking 2.007, which had a reputation of taking a lot of time, and three HASS classes, so I wanted to add just one other technical. I’d be taking three technicals in fall; didn’t it make sense to take the hardest one now, and the easier ones later? Following this logic, I took 2.005 my sophomore spring, and 2.003 and 2.086 my junior fall. The issue is that most meches take 2.086 and 2.003 their sophomore year, and 2.005 and 2.671 (Do a Research Project) their junior fall. So while my academic path made sense for me, I was separated from the junior meche community for a semester.  The ‘25s are really nice, and I got to spend time with a Course 22 junior friend in 2.086, so I had a good time. I also dodged a bullet with 2.005, which was much harder in fall than in spring. Going forward, however, I want to be more in sync with the ‘24 meches around me. I still went to parties and hung out with friends around campus, but I had less time to do so, and I missed everyone sometimes 🙁  Also my company after 2 all-nighters is less entertaining than usual. I made a dragon sword! Spent about 6 hours in the forge each week, a major improvement from 2 hours. And I got a UROP with one of the forge instructors! This fall, for the first time since high school, I came back from summer to well-established friend groups and dorm communities I cared about, and who cared about me. My friends were definitely the highlight of my semester. 
The Killers, ⁠ 02 I SAW THEMMMM MY FAVORITE BAND we are at the Killers!! After a year off the bandwagon, I jumped back on and pumped iron all semester! My bench PR has gone up by 20 lbs. I can forge with the 4-lb hammer now. I had a few ideas for personal projects, but the 72 units I was taking swept them away. Instead, I spent this semester focused on projects for classes: I built a cactus lamp in October, and forged an array of bottle openers and a dragon sword in November and December. I learned many blacksmithing skills over the course of these builds, from sheet metal work to chieseling to tying knots with metal. My goals for future projects are to get my hands on group building projects (such as the yo-yos in 2.008, or various engineering clubs), explore more integrated systems (such as the Arcturus boats or the project in my new UROP), and learn about meshing electronics with mechanical systems (from 2.007, but also my UROP, Arcturus, etc). I’m tailoring my schedule for next year to account for those goals, which fell by the wayside this semester. Which brings

Also find entertaining podcasts/playlists → I enjoyed doing this once and now want to find even more! Friend recs, prep for upcoming concerts read more than one book ever → I’m gonna try to re-wire myself to take breaks via reading instead of by disappearing into my phone. Wish me luck. spent more time with friends!!! → take fewer classes, schedule less work on Saturday mornings meet new people → have more free time; do work ahead of time so you can join spontaneous activities; invest time in clubs and go to unfamiliar events clubs in mind: Divest, SHPE, Arcturus, MIT Monologues I also want to go to Berklee house concerts. I think it will be nice to leave the MIT bubble and spend time around artists. However these are quite far from campus so we will see how easy it is to rally people to join me → attend club meetings, hackathons, and conferences Happy Fits concert :) group projects → 2.008, Arcturus systems engineering → Arcturus, UROP electrical engineering → Arc, UROP enhance CAD skills → UROP, 2.008 apply MatLab skills → 2.671 design a research project (I am not terribly passionate about this, but 2.671 requires it, so I’ll bring the hype) decide what to do this summer (do I want to be in Italy or be in Cambridge at my cool new UROP) also maybe globally? learn more about electronics → 2.679 maybe? understand the energy industry → read The Tech, listen to 1-2 episodes of a recommended podcast each week.

things I did:  quogs in a ‘metastable state’ spent more time with my wing  at next house, each floor is divided into two wings, and each wing has multiple lounges, where people come to hang out and study.  compared to last year, I now live closer to our main wing lounge so I spent a lot more time there, working, or not, and made a lot of fond memories.  we eliminated a

proved P = NP, ⁠ 02 P and NP are classes of languages for which you can check if something is in the language in polynomial time. the difference is that NP allows ‘lucky guessing.’ an open problem in theoretical computer science is to prove whether P and NP are equal. in multiple problem sets for 18.404, we messed up in just the right way to show that P = NP 
alphabet. ⁠ 03 in case you are wondering, the best letter is L obsessed with our pink frog plushie, we used some of our wing budget to buy three more of them. they are very soft, so naturally, you’ll see them being thrown around the lounge a lot. helped Jonathan H. ’25 learn Urdu  last year, I told Jonathan the Urdu word for sarcasm and somehow, he still remembered it this year. I offered to teach more words and thereby began our language lessons. because I am a native speaker, I don’t explicitly know a lot of the rules so it is really fun to revisit them with him. we have learned how to say ‘where did you come from, where did you go’ in Urdu. actually listened in on 6.006 I dropped  6.006 participated in a quiz bowl tournament  some people on our floor were going to Yale for the ACF Winter Quizbowl tournament and asked if other folks were interested. Katie K. ’24, Andrew L. ’24 and I decided to go last minute, so we had an entire car of just
 
4W ⁠ 04 four west, my wing in Next House SIX! watched a live production of a musical  I went with Silu S. ’24 to watch Six at the Emerson Theater in Boston. the theater is beautiful! we had great seats and the musical itself was great. it had a more concert-y vibe than the average musical and was very lively and energetic!  went to a chamber music concert  I went to a chamber music concert with Holden M. ’25. I do not have any actual musical expertise and have always been scared that I will not enjoy going to something like this but it was actually very fun. we basically had front row seats and the pieces were great. I especially loved ‘Sonata for Flute, Viola and Harp’ and ‘Two Pieces for Flute, Cello and Harp, Op. 80.’ went to non-zero student group performances I went to watch MIT Shakespeare Ensemble’s fall show ‘As You Like It’ with Prajna N. ’25. she was the assistant producer and one of the assistant stage managers for the show which meant she also had to be at the lighting booth for a couple of the showings but we got to watch it together on opening night!  I also got to see Alan Z. ’23 and Silu perform at the Asymptones concert and Katie at the wind ensemble concert!    18.701. at the beginning of the semester, this class felt impossible. a couple weeks in, I found a great pset group to work with, started going to office hours religiously and ended up learning so much from the class. black holes are cool went to two 8.033 lectures? on the Monday of the last week of classes, my poetry class started relatively later than usual, so I went to the 8.033 lecture instead with Leo Y. ’25, Matthew H. ’25 and Alan(who was also there for no reason). I learned that the singularity is at the center of the blackhole.
 05 this is actually false. I really learned that the singularity is a moment in time, not a place in space so it doesn’t even make sense to say that did not kill my plant garfield in october! last year, I got a succulent at a study break that I named sandwich. I somehow managed to kill it very quickly by either overwatering or underwatering or a mix of both.  at the beginning of this year, with some encouragement from Katie, I decided to pot the marigold seeds I had from last year. this plant, Garfield, did pretty well for almost the entire semester. I generally measure my mental health by how often I remember to take care of my plant so this is a very good thing.  close to the end though, two out of the three sprigs died but one of them still has leaves, so I am hoping it won’t completely die. after all, there’s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.

When I started senior fall, I was taking a course load of 6
 
classes. ⁠ 01 I am writing this down in class-equivalents; MIT has a horrifically cursed system of <a href="https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/subject-levels-credit">units</a>, where 12 units is considered the equivalent of a "normal" class. perhaps that deserves another blog post later. 5.5 7.5 
our Area Director. ⁠ 02 a <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/life-campus/undergraduate-residential-life/whos-house">professional staff member</a> who lives in the dorm and helps out with student support and, often, a lot of organizational tasks. This was not to be the case. I ended up dropping two classes. Both had content-related justifications: the first, a class on the fundamentals of computer security, was just not quite as exciting as my other two classes on computer systems; and the second, a class on musicals, did not have a quality of instruction which made me feel I was going to gain anything from the class. The root cause, however, was that I was working
 
at a level I had scarcely seen while at MIT, ⁠ 03 the worst week—the second week of classes—I did 62 hours of work, just under the <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/sunset-sunrise/">two record weeks</a> of fall 2020. Despite opening the relief valve, I still felt like I was flailing. Some part of me felt like a past version of me should’ve been able to keep up with both of those classes and my other commitments. The workload was high, but it wasn’t something I’d never seen before; surely, an added dollop of efficiency and just a little more grit could’ve gotten me there. More worryingly, I kept making unforced errors. I’d have an email on my radar as something to send, and then forget about it for two weeks until suddenly it was either extremely urgent or already too late. I punted the task of finding a thesis advisor, a task necessary for my graduation, until after Drop Date; my advisor and I would end up having to work out a plan for me to do the requisite work during IAP. Despite having been given three weeks to produce the final paper for my biography class—a twenty-page sketch about the life of former Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben S. Bernanke—I ended up beginning to write in earnest just three days before the paper was due, resulting in a record-setting twenty-seven consecutive hours of consciousness in my scramble to actually finish it. By the end of the semester, I was taking 49 units, the approximate equivalent of four classes. It was fewer units than I’d taken at any point during my MIT career, including freshman fall,
 
where I had taken 56. ⁠ 04 MIT policy on this has changed over time, specifically since I was a first-year. in general, first-year students have a credit limit placed upon them, in order to prevent them from jumping the proverbial shark. in my year, it was 48 units, with an additional 9 units allowed for 'discovery' credit, which I used liberally. making the same mistakes as before Fortunately, none of my remaining classes had finals, and so, after my ill-paced dive into the world of monetary policy—plus a wrapping up a group final project in one class and a “quiz” worth 25% of our grade in another—my break started on December 14th, a week and a day before finals season would wrap up for many of my friends. I took the chance to start reading again, and to reflect on the semester which had troubled me. Upon reflection, I realized that—in spite of the number of classes—this semester was, frankly, as difficult as the other ones. There were weeks where I was working twenty hours   classes and extracurriculars, between my SuperUROP and shifts at desk. The two computer science classes I ended up in—one on database systems, and the other on computer system architecture—were graduate-level courses, which necessarily made them more time-intensive than undergraduate ones. In combination with my earlier assessments of increasing extracurricular workloads, the response seems perfectly reasonable.  Of course, things were difficult; they were always going to be that way This does not mean, of course, that things could not have been better. I have always been guilty of biting off more than I can chew—sometimes, to the unfair detriment of others—and a maybe a hint of senioritis, that eternal disease of students with (metaphorically) graying hair, has hindered my ability to manage time and tasks and emails as well as I used to. Yet, it is hardly the worst thing that could have happened. All in all, technically speaking, senior fall was not that bad. It might even have been good. It was simultaneously relieving and frustrating to have this realization: relieving, because I was glad to realize that I hadn’t completely lost my touch, and frustrating, because I feel like I if I had realized it earlier, I might have felt happier and performed better. I think it is often too easy for certain kinds of people—especially at this school—to forget that they are doing really difficult things, to buy into this myth that they should always be doing  . In the midst of all these people, taking more classes, doing more things, it is so hard to remember that “ you do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting  thing, it is  the marathon  to begin with, and that failing to achieve it is exactly is not indicative of our failure  . But even now, seven semesters in, I forget. Over break, I’ve been reading a lot, between books that I started reading during my biography class, Proust’s  , and some poetry collections, as recommended to me by my thesis advisor. A few days ago, however, I ended up stumbling through a romance novel that Goodreads kept recommending to me, and, in spite—or perhaps, because—of its nature, one question near the end hit me. One character comes to a reckoning that they have become someone they did not expect to become, and the other asks: “but do you like them?” And, for a moment, I thought about it. What have I grown into, and do I like them? And, I kind of do. I think the thing about changing is that we keep forgetting that it happened; that sometimes, we keep asking the question “how do I get better?” and feel like we haven’t made any progress along the way. It is the  hedonic treadmill I feel completely fine . But, now and again, I stop and look back at it and I think, “yeah, I’ve changed, but, yeah, I kind of like it.” My roommate this semester told me that “you seem relatively good at saying no [to things].” He’s wrong, but isn’t that progress? Another friend of mine, when discussing class choices for next semester, told me that “you’re lucky know exactly what you’re interested in,” which reminded me of my total uncertainty  just over a year ago , because I just kept moving forward. Yes, my senior fall is over, and I am painfully aware that I am now just one semester away from graduating. But, this place has made me a much better person—more confident, more independent, more willing to stand up for myself—and I need to stop forgetting that.   I took two graduate classes in computer systems; I wrote fifty pages of creative non-fiction; I helped organize a Thanksgiving dinner that fed over a hundred people without a hitch. When the semester ended, I filled a one-inch binder with everything I’d written this year, and left it on the table for my wing-mates to read. I am still biting off more things than I can chew; it’s a hard habit to kick, and if four years here hasn’t done it, I’m not sure what will. But, I’m getting better at being a person, in all the little corners of myself, and, sometimes—perhaps more often than I’m letting myself do now—I just need to take a break, slow down a bit, and look back and remember that progress.

As I mentioned in
 my last blog ⁠ 01 which was uhhh a while ago oops sorry MIT Glass Lab This semester, I was taking the beginner class for the second time: it’s standard practice for people to repeat this class twice before moving to intermediate classes because it covers a ton of content. When I took it for the first time last semester, I definitely learned each technique we covered, but I wasn’t fully comfortable with a lot of them, particularly the more advanced techniques from the later part of the class. Taking it a second time helped me get a lot more comfortable. I really enjoyed noticing how over time, some actions became more instinctive for me,  everything just flowed a little better, and I was able to push myself to make more interesting pieces and see my ideas come to life. Here’s all the stuff I made! The   of beginner class is partly learning about safety in the lab, since you’re going to be working with glass that is literally thousands of degrees hot. You also learn how to “gather”. This means putting a glassblowing
 
pipe ⁠ 02 or punty. Both are long sticks that you put glass on the end of, but we'll get to the differences later. 
neatly ⁠ 03 neatness not guaranteed : paperweights If you think about it, a paperweight is really just a lump of glass. It can be completely round on the outside, and completely solid on the inside, making it one of the easiest glass shapes to create. That’s why we start with it! To make these colored paperweights, you gather with a small amount of clear glass and color it using “frit”, tiny pieces of colored glass that will stick to the hot, clear glass. Once the frit has melted into the overall piece, you can shape it and make it look cool. Then you finish off by gathering more clear glass over the colors and forming it into a round shape. The blue and purple one was my first piece of the semester, and I kept things pretty simple by just going for a mishmash look – I picked up some blue, purple, and white (which is harder to see here just cause of the lighting), and twisted the glass to make them all flow together. The firey-looking one was my next attempt. I got a bit bold here and tried to make it look like a real fire. However, I didn’t account for the optic distortion that the thick glass causes – the top of the colored section always looks really close to the top of the paperweight and “spread out” (as you can also see a little with the leftmost piece). Because of this, the flame shapes I put at the top of the fire don’t really show up – you can see them a tiny bit if you look closely on the left photo. The yellow swirl was my third attempt. Interestingly, this swirl was originally just yellow and blue, but the chemicals that were used to make those two colors of frit must have had an interaction, causing that weird brownish green to appear wherever the yellow and blue met. It’s not quite as cheery of a look as I wanted, but the swirl is pretty tight and even, so I felt good about it on a technical level if not an artistic one. : ornaments An ornament is basically a paperweight with a bubble in the middle, meaning that it’s a good shape for learning how to actually  glass. When we were making paperweights, we gathered them on a punty, a pipe-shaped object that’s solid all the way through. But to make ornaments and all the other pieces, you gather on a pipe that’s hollow and has holes at both ends (like a giant metal straw!). You put air in one end of the pipe to blow a bubble in the glass on the other end. (Traditionally, putting the air in the pipe happened via a person’s actual mouth. But when Covid happened, the Glass Lab set up a really ingenious compressed air system, so now instead we attach rubber valves to the pipe ends and use foot pedals to control the air.) My favorite ornament is the purplish one in the back – I thought I was coloring it plain purple, but we were accidentally using a bag of frit that had had a couple different colors mixed together, and the interactions they had with each other produced that cool mottled look. I really like the evil pumpkin vibe it has. : cups Next up after ornaments is cups! This is another big jump in terms of technical skills. An ornament is pretty much finished once you’re done making the bubble inside it, but to make a cup, you blow a bubble, transfer the piece from the pipe to a punty, and then open up the bubble to create the top of the cup. Many useful objects in the world have this same approximate shape — for example, a bowl or a plate or an open-top box, if you think about it, is just a weird-shaped cup. This means the process of transferring the piece and opening up the bubble is a really important skill, and we spent an extra week working on just that. In this picture, I have one clear piece and one colored one. Working with color always makes your pieces more difficult: the frits have different heat capacities from each other and from the clear glass, meaning that a colored piece might cool down faster or more quickly than you’re expecting, or even at different speeds over different parts of the piece. Particularly for beginners, who aren’t familiar with how each color can act, this can lead to a wide variety of minor disasters. So when learning a new form it’s best to start with a clear version. In some of the later pictures, I’ve omitted my mediocre clear pieces and just showed you the colored ones I made after getting some practice in. The cup on the right is a perfectly fine clear cup. Its main issue, which many of my (and other beginners’ pieces) have, is that the lip is very thick. Making something thin is hard: thin glass gains and loses heat faster, and it moves around more, making it harder to control. It’s also easy to accidentally make something too thin and have it simply crumple in on itself. So, beginners err on the side of making things too thick, which has the less-serious side effect of heavy pieces that are a bit hard to drink from. The cup on the left is one I’m proud of! The net/grid pattern (which I think has a name I’ve forgotten) is tricky to make, and although mine is nowhere near as good as the pros’, for a first try, it went well. I also really enjoyed the execution: this was one of the pieces this year where I felt the most in control of the whole process, where every action I took produced the result I wanted to and there were no surprises or accidents. It was a great feeling! : vases Like I said, vases (and bowls below) are sort of like cups that you did some extra things to.  To make a vase, you add an extra neckline where the neck of the vase starts, but you don’t pull it in as much as you do for a neckline you’d use to knock the piece off, leaving a channel to hold flower stems, etc. This vase has an interesting origin story: I was working with dark purple for the first time, and I didn’t realize that purple cools down a lot faster than I had expected. Because of this, the glass was moving more slowly and when I tried to blow the bubble, it didn’t blow out as much as I thought. The result is a very thick and small vase — you can see how much glass is left at the bottom of it. Although this was unintentional, I think it looks pretty cool. And it was a good learning experience! Color, man. It gets you every time. : bowls A bowl is a cup with an larger opening and a more gradual curve between the sides and the bottom. Getting that gradual curve requires a heat gradient between the top and the bottom of the bowl. For a cup, you want the bottom to be cold so that it stays thick, and the sides warm so that they are thinner and can be opened up. For a bowl, this is still true, but it’s also important to have the change be gradual and continuous so that there isn’t any sharp line in the bowl where the glass suddenly gets hotter and its width or angle changes more than that of the colder glass. Doing an okay job of this isn’t too hard, but doing a really good job is very difficult, so most beginner bowls are just a little screwy looking. I have a lot of slightly-screwy-looking clear bowls, but this colored one is definitely my best! This bowl actually does have a bit of a sudden width change (you can sort of see the line, about 3/4 of the way up the bowl), but it’s on the inside, and the outside looks really nice! I was particularly happy with how the blue-to-clear gradient in the frit came out. The top lip of the bowl, where the blue is brightest, was actually originally a separate piece of glass, called a “lip wrap” because it gets attached as a long string of glass that attaches to the lip opening as you rotate the piece. Having a separate lip wrap lets you make the lip a different color than the rest of the piece, and it can also help clean up a messy lip. However, getting it to be the same width all around and smoothly integrated into the rest of the piece is tricky. I felt really good about how this one turned out! : student’s choice! When I look back on everything I made this semester, I feel really good about the skills I’ve learned and the ways I’ve pushed myself to improve. I also feel incredibly lucky. The people who staff the MIT Glass Lab give so much of their time to teach us beginners, semester after semester, as we stumble through the mistakes that everyone has to make in order to improve. Although the lab does charge for their classes,
 
the fees ⁠ 04 I know this because I'm graduating and was looking into how I could keep glassblowing after I move away. WOW was I surprised to see the price differential. #Glassblowing

For the second year in a row, I am teaching a class at MIT. A real, for-credit, in-the-catalog-of-classes class, at MIT. That I teach. On math. Let’s back up a moment. In the math department, there are four versions of one class known as real analysis: 18.100A, 18.100B, 18.100P, and 18.100Q. A few things of note: i) real analysis seeks to, in addition to other pedagogical goals, teach how one proves that calculus works, and ii) P and Q are meant to just be communication intensive versions of A and B but this is fairly besides the point. One might ask,  ? To which the indirect answer would be to say that there didn’t use to be. There used to be (from my understanding of the history of the course) just one version of the class that all pure mathematics majors are supposed to take. This course was deep, and rigorous, and really  . Like, it’s meant to be a class you can in theory take after  
18.02, ⁠ 01 Multivariable Calculus This may be for a few reasons. One may be that  
there didn’t exist a class on proof writing. ⁠ 02 at least until last year, when a class was created motivated by one class run by the UMA and various people around the mathematics department Another reason, simply, might be that the class is just so abstract. The classic “we aren’t in Kansas” level abstract. In 18.02, mathematics is done over  
Euclidean space. ⁠ 03 for our purposes, you can just picture this as a flat plane which is two-dimensional Euclidean space , higher generality. So only having one class meant, almost consistently, under serving   subset of the class, whether that be students who want to learn everything at the difficult abstract level, or those who may   to learn those topics later, but who needed/wanted more time with the introductory simple examples. Thus, over time, the class was split into two classes: real analysis over Euclidean space, and real analysis over metric spaces. This division, however, can occasionally create its own problems for students. A   is, at its core, an understanding of distance. We measure distance everyday, but in weirder ways than one might first imagine. Take for instance, Euclidean distance. This notion of a distance, is essentially the Pythagorean theorem: it gives the shortest path from point   to point  . However, you can also measure distance slightly differently. This tool is deeply important in multivariable calculus as it gives a notion of   
magnitude for vectors. ⁠ 04 in particular, this is given by the Euclidean distance from a point <em>a</em> to the origin Take for example, the taxicab metric, named so after grid-like cities such as New York City. Suppose I want to go from the corner on 1st and 42nd to the corner on 2nd and 43rd. Reasonably, I cannot walk through walls to get to my destination quickly and effectively; rather, I need to follow the grid. Like I’m in a taxicab that can only drive on the road– you add the number of blocks (in this case, two) as opposed to the absolute shortest distance. So again, a metric is conceptually just a distance, a function,  which we want to satisfy certain properties:  in your space, we want  to be bigger than or equal to 0. Furthermore, if  , then  .
 
In layman’s terms: We want our distance function to spit out non-negative values (naturally), and if the distance between two points is zero, we want those two points to be the same. ,  .
 
This is saying that the distance from me to you, should be the same as the distance from you to me. , we have   is less than or equal to  
This is simply saying, for example, that the distance from me to you should be less than the distance from me to Wide Tim plus the distance from Wide Tim to you. These three properties define a metric, and vaguely make sense by how distance works in our real world. It isn’t the most insane definition, but it’s powerful. And the implications of these simple assumptions are used  in future analysis courses. And the people in 18.100A, most of the time, never learn about this definition. So some students would get to the next class and feel behind immediately. Like they were missing some crucial piece of information that everyone is treating as obvious when it  . And this, is a problem. One my class tries to remedy partially. me in my natural setting: teaching in a classroom Fall of my sophomore year, I started cold-emailing people in the math department to see if a class like this could be offered. Early on in the process, I was told that it might be a good idea for me to teach it, and as someone who loves education, I jumped at the chance. Then, I had to wait. Specifically, I had to wait for an education committee to sign off on the class being offered that IAP. This part took a few  months. Then, late in November, I got an email from Larry saying “P.S. Paige, your class is officially approved!” The class was numbered 18.S097: Intro to Metric Spaces. Then, I had to prepare. Over the course of the two weeks between winter break and the beginning of IAP, I typed up nearly 40 pages of lecture notes, created 4 problemsets, and learned basic HTML to create this  class website Professor Dyatlov’s site And what came afterwards, was comparably amazing. First, I advocated for the class to be put on OpenCourseWare (OCW). This was a little bit irregular, in that the class had only been taught once, but I thought it was really important to get this material out there. It can give students the opportunity to learn analysis at their speed and have   of the resources at their disposal to succeed. A few months later, and the course was made  available Also, besides this, I also won an award for teaching the class. Now, I’m gearing up to teach the class again! The number has changed (as the topics ones are prone to do) to  18.S190 I also want to use this post (as well as one coming soon) to emphasize   opportunities can come out of MIT from your own imagination. You can work with OCW, you can teach a class, you can make your ideas a reality. The largest and most difficult step in my opinion of this process is simply emailing people. You need to know the right people, and if you don’t know the right people, you need to know who   know the right people and need to reach out to them. The result can be something you’re really proud of. #paige doing math #teaching

The semester is over and I didn’t go home for winter break because I have so much to do. In the last few months, my writing career got pushed to the back burner so I could survive my classes (four technicals, all on grades…the most I’ve ever taken), so I opted to stay on campus instead to meet my deadlines and work on projects I’ve been dreaming about. Right now, I’m sitting in Hayden Library, watching the sun sink over the Charles River, and even after so many years here, the beauty of Cambridge in winter still astonishes me. Okay, the air is spicy and the sky darkens much too early, but I love the aesthetics: children in knit caps, sunshine on frost, rough-hewn tree branches. It’s New England romanticized, I know, and aesthetics are not so interesting. But maybe I’m in a sentimental mood. I wanted to give some thoughts on the classes I took this semester. Please note that these are only my opinions and I have my own context and career goals, so they might not accurately reflect others’ experiences. I generally liked this class, but I didn’t like how “black box” some of it was. Maybe this is how I feel about computer science classes in general; as a math major, I feel like a lot of concepts or techniques don’t get adequately proven, and there’s some level of “just trust that this works.” But I like how this class had a flipped-classroom model, where we were expected to do readings outside of class and then spent recitations and labs applying the knowledge, and I liked learning about different machine learning topics. This class offered a broad survey into a variety of techniques within ML, which I found interesting. If I have any regrets about this class, I wish I had put more time into truly studying the subject, since I found it was easy to “get by” by just doing the problem sets without actually understanding the material on a deep level. Oof, I took this class because I needed another computer science credit, and I figured since I was taking Machine Learning already, this class would be pretty chill. But I really found this class to be all over the place. Problem sets and quizzes were often poorly written, a lot of the quiz questions felt pointless because they asked us to implement algorithms by hand (but wouldn’t we code them in real life?). I didn’t end up investing a lot of time in this class. If I could choose my courses again for this semester, I think I would’ve just taken something else instead. This class was  but  When my friends heard I was taking this class, they were like, “Dude, don’t do it, that class is so hard.” I also came into this course with a lot less coding experience than my peers; at the time, I hadn’t even passed 6.101 (Fundamentals of Programming), for reasons I’ll go into more later. This class  difficult. It was a crash course in C++, a bootcamp in writing vast amounts of code, and a low-level look into dynamic computer languages. But I really like performance optimization and that’s what I want to eventually focus on, so this class was absolutely worth it. I ended up devoting a lot of time in this class, and many days, I would be the only one in office hours. But I ended up learning so much! Bless my teammates Richard L. ’23 and Amy L. ’23 for being so incredible and really carrying the group project. If I have any regrets about this class, I would start earlier and also read the assignments more carefully. I love this course and the lecturer, Michael Sipser, is amazing. (My friend, Robert C. ’23, once interviewed him and found out that Professor Sipser spends up to 15 hours preparing a lecture.) The only thing I didn’t really love was that I felt like it lacked some of the rigor that I would expect from a math course, but I understood that the audience was full of non-math majors so it made sense that it wasn’t as proof-y as some of my other math classes. I don’t think I’ll end up doing too much theoretical computer science, since my main interest is in systems and optimization, but this was a great class full of really fun problems. If I have any regrets about this class, I wish I put more time in and studied harder for the final, which was a really brutal three hours exacerbated by the all-nighter I pulled. So I took this class last fall, but due to health issues, I ended up OX-ing it, meaning I didn’t finish the classwork required to pass. So I had to do two of the problem sets this semester. Honestly, doing this class again after all the experience I’ve gained within the last year really demonstrated how much I’ve learned from my internship and coursework, as it felt so much easier this time around. It felt so rewarding, because it meant I had grown as a software engineer. I’m relieved I’ve finally been able to complete this class. I only stayed in this class for about a month, but I’m including it since I did do like three of the problem sets. Honestly, I just felt like this class wasn’t teaching me anything I really wanted to learn, since I’m not that interested in algorithms for imaging, so I dropped it. However, it is a chill class since it is all problem-set based, and the immediate feedback loop of seeing your code’s visual output is dopamine-inducing, so I would recommend this class for people interested in this area!

This fall, I took 21W.762 Poetry Workshop with Ed Barrett, a  popular class amongst bloggers . 21W.762 was by far the most easygoing class I’ve taken at MIT: every week we’d write a poem in our own time and then read it out aloud during class for a round of feedback. And that was it! I’ve never really written poetry beyond the flowery text in my zine comics, so I appreciated having a non-judgemental environment to experiment with language vulnerably.  Here are a few poems that I wrote! Ed gave us suggested forms for each week, but it was completely up to us if we wanted to actually follow the form or modify the form to our liking.   1. i did not like my summer internship “i love going to Trader Joes to pick up chicks,”  my coworker coos, recounting his afterwork escapades between sips of White Claw,  “the waitress was hot so I tipped her extra”  i go to Trader Joe’s to pick up caprese ravioli and pork shu mai  and let the whirr of the office microwave drown out the thought that he,  “loves going to Trader Joes to pick up chicks” i learn about the overturn of Roe v. Wade over Keurig-brewed coffee,  angry and confused as to how, until I realize that this is the same world where  “the waitress was hot so i tipped her extra”  my pain is a stone fruit whose pit swells against my epiglottis,  whose rotten flesh I cannot vomit out in an office where everyone else is a man, including one who “loves going to Trader Joes to pick up chicks” i drag myself into the Women’s ERG Slack Channel,   seeking refuge from being baptized by spit flying from his testosterone fueled charisma:  “the waitress was hot so i tipped her extra”  i message my manager saying that I’m taking the rest of the day off,  because I have a bad stomach ache, or so i say “i love going to Trader Joes to pick up chicks” “the waitress was hot so I tipped her extra”  ——- This poem followed a villanelle’s pattern of repetition, in which the first and third lines are repeated throughout alternating stanzas of the poem.  The repeated lines unfortunately were actual quotes from a fellow intern this past summer. This poem could use more wordsmithing to smooth out awkward areas, but it was cathartic to write and therefore served its purpose.  My summer internship had seemed perfect on paper. A dream come true, even. Once it actually started, I quickly felt disillusioned. Between working in an isolating environment, struggling under a supervisor who simultaneously maintained high expectations but didn’t have the time to properly support me, getting woken up at 5am every morning by my subleaser’s rabbit from hell, and putting up with an absolute slob of a roommate, my summer was  rough . It took everything in me to not toss my work laptop in one of the many dumpsters ubiquitous to the streets of Manhattan. I now know that my experience wasn’t and shouldn’t be the norm, but a part of me still fears not being able to hold down a Real Job in the future.  2. when sapphics say love is in the air when i am with you,  we expand to fill the night sky’s infinity your river of hair tickles the stars and city lights blink like shiny pebbles between our toes i want to pluck the silver flower of moonlight  and tuck it behind your ear  i want to weave the threads of cloud  into an infinity scarf that can wrap around the both of us being with you makes me see that everything is so beautiful  from a height where to stay grounded is to float away, where  to come out is to stay in  your arms i want my lips to be the wind that brushes against your cheek  ——- painted using gouache (an opaque watercolor)! this is the first time i’ve used gouache since high school, which is bittersweet since i used to paint a ton Ed is a firm believer in the idea that every poem is a love poem. Perhaps one could argue that by giving space to my anger and frustration, the shitty coworker poem was a love poem to myself. But I wanted to try writing an “actual” love poem, one bundled with good feels and good feels  only . I was inspired by the song Sweater Weather’s themes of creating your own bubble of warmth and intimacy that protects you from a cold and callous outside world. Although I’ll always see poetry as an outlet for angst, I wish for a future full of love poems, the mushy gushy kind.  3. plastic knives spraypainted silver “Mom, where did I come from?” Oh darling, I found you in the dump!  Your heart is a clay pot whose cracks  I repaired with shrimp paste,  don’t let the weight of your secrets reopen them. Your lungs are the two back tires  I unscrewed from a Honda,  the front two lost all their air when that Honda embraced a tree.  Your ribs are mismatching pieces of silverware  (mostly plastic knives spraypainted silver),  but I laid a real gold spoon right above your clay pot heart.  Your stomach is a leather makeup purse  whose dirty spots I rubbed clean with vinegar,  keep it zipped shut for I want your beauty to come from within. Your teeth are fragments of stone that I tumbled against each other for weeks,  to smooth the edges that could cut your delicate cheek. Your eyes are the lenses of disposable cameras  whose film you’ve since replaced,  But I hope you can forever see and remember that I love you  ——- This poem is a blazon, a form that traditionally lists off parts of a woman’s body in comparison to desirable objects. Yikes. Contemporary blazons still list physical attributes or body parts, but in a way that either subverts the objectifying male gaze or tackles completely different themes.  I was thinking about how parents from different cultures explain where babies come from, like how storks delivering babies from the sky is primarily a European tradition. While I believe my parents told me something vague like “you came out of your mother’s stomach,” it’s common for Asian immigrant parents to tell their children “we found you in the dumpster!” I’m guessing the intent is to instill gratitude within their children. A demeaning way of doing so, that is. Or maybe I’m reading too much into this, and it’s out of the same affection that you might jokingly call your close friends “trash.”  In this poem, I wanted to write about an imperfect parental love. A fierce love that comes with the best of intentions to give their children a life better than their own. I will never have to experience hardships of the same magnitude that older generations of my family did, which I am intensely grateful for, but their hurt inevitably trickled into my upbringing despite how fiercely they loved me. Ultimately, shrimp paste only goes so far for keeping clay pot hearts together; therapy tends to be a stronger adhesive.  4. yet another sleepless night did you turn off the stove? did your words hit a sore spot in her heart? you messed up  so badly early and I’ll make sure  that you replay that scene in your head over and over again— something tells me that that sleep tonight is not going to come easy the way the bedsheets brush against my skin uneasily  phantom itches that only multiply with the avalanche of words that i wish i could spit out tonight as unrefrigerated perishables, loose screws, toilet seats left up, the itches announce themselves again— maybe you should check the stove just to be sure  if the gas was still on, i’d be unconscious by now. surely rationalizing my overactive brain into sleep can’t the easy  way out, the way that once again stupid, irrational fears render themselves into words flashing costume jewelry gold on the marquee lit up inside my brain, announcing which horror film is on for tonight i am scared of how the night is slowly wasting away into day, but surely i still have time to wander into the land of dreams. walk up  the stairs, one two three. walk down the stairs, one two three. easy your breathing, ease your mind, until her words that I wish to forget resurface once again oh how stupid you must be to let that get to you again your rage is useless in the night your screams will only carry empty words you can punch something, sure  but nothing will give you the easy  relief that you so crave —to win this night is to give up am i even waking up  if i never fell asleep in the first place? again the morning light taunts me, telling me at least it’ll be easy for my worn out body and mind to find asleep the next night i ask the sun, are you sure? he only continues to shrivel my eyes dry, smiling without a word ——- It’s a sestina! Fatima and Alan’s  blog  explains it concisely: “a sestina is a poetry form consisting of six sestets, having the same six end words in each of the stanzas, but in a different order. The poem ends with a tercet which has two of the end words per line.” (speaking of which, I can’t wait for their sestinas to grace the blogs!! much hype) I ended up forgoing the ending tercet though, since a) I procrastinated by writing this poem right before class and b) the story already felt complete.  Right after I wrote  a blog about being happy and generally doing well #21W.762 Poetry Workshop

Song:  It’s 9:05 am. The sunlight subtly and softly trickles into the room just like it did all those episodes ago in the  season premiere A voice narration begins. I attribute many feelings to love or to hate. When asked how I feel about a situation, I usually say something akin to “I love that feeling when” or “I hate that–“. It’s a bit of a catch-all really. Because what I   to say is that I am feeling a feeling about something. What that   is, or even what precisely that   is, often alludes me. All I know is that I like or don’t like how I feel about this feeling (that I can’t quite pin down), and I say that I love it or (more often) that I hate it. This is how I talked about my first day of my junior year nearly three months ago. I hated, and felt invigorated, by how fresh the semester felt. Fresh starts are good, but they always feel  . Like a paper cut your mind can’t quite ignore yet, or the very first thoughts of grief. It was hard to not feel bittersweet about reaching the halfway mark of my time at MIT. I felt like there were too many stories left to be told. And that scared me. Now the semester is ending, and I still don’t know how to describe how I feel. But oh boy will I try harder than just saying that I love or that I hate it. Because this time, I’m choosing to feel “it” more. It has been a really   semester. Like, an “Oh no what if I need to use all four Pass/No Records” kind of semester. Like a “let’s start up weekly therapy appointments again” semester. One that drags on and on while simultaneously speeding through the days like a camera cutting from one scene to the next. I expected to feel some amount of relief with the ending of the school year. I was ready for this giant sigh of “I’m done” after I closing my last exam booklet. And it isn’t like I don’t feel   amount of relief. It’s just that it feels exactly the same as every semester before. It’s a tad bit sadder given how hard of a semester it’s been, but I still just feel  . I get to leave a part of myself behind me, and move onto what’s next. Is the word for this closure? I think it is. The semester started, it went by, and I finished. Now I get to go home for ten days. I get to prepare for the feeling of yet another fresh start. I get to feel whatever this feeling is for as long as I want to feel it. I start walking towards Next. It hasn’t started raining yet. But the rain will come soon. It always does somehow. Song:  The camera cuts once more to me packing my suitcase and my carry-on for my flight tomorrow morning. I used to hate the last day of the school year, almost more than I hated the first day. I’d feel this slight sorrow of knowing that I would need to push through another semester and exceed my own expectations for myself. I don’t feel this way anymore. For the first time, I feel ready for a break. A mindful, perhaps somewhat chaotic, intentional break. I hate that it took vaguely breaking a little bit for me to finally give myself the room   take an actual break, but I’m ready for it nonetheless. To the few more semesters I have left (62.5% complete), to many more songs and to many, many more blogposts. Song:  The camera pans out of the window and points towards the sky. The sky changes color to indicate the passing of the day. It pans back down to my window, as I type this last blogpost (for me) for this year, and I close my laptop. — p.s. also, really really unimportant, but there’s a  blogger Spotify account #okay but I'm actually done woo #paige being meta #rain

This is my fourth (and last) post like this. See  2019 2020 2021 These are all taken from 21W.765 Interactive Narrative.  Surrealist short story that messes with time. It’s worth dissecting this piece to figure out how it achieves its effect. If you read one thing from this list, read this.

While it is technically true that “guns don’t kill people; people with guns kill people”, guns happen to be well optimized for killing people, just as Victorian hallway benches were well optimized for discomfort. Technologies can certainly be appropriated for different uses; a technology designed for “evil” could also be used for “good” and vice versa. One could, for example, dig a hole with a gun, just as one could kill someone with a shovel. But each is clearly better suited to the opposite task.  David Foster Wallace. A model for writing about a technical topic for a general audience, with beautiful descriptions of tennis. Of course, in men’s sports no one ever talks about beauty or grace or the body. Men may profess their “love” of sports, but that love must always be cast and enacted in the symbology of war: elimination vs. advance, hierarchy of rank and standing, obsessive statistics, technical analysis, tribal and/or nationalist fervor, uniforms, mass noise, banners, chest-thumping, face-painting, etc. For reasons that are not well understood, war’s codes are safer for most of us than love’s.  on Conway’s  Game of Life There are three main techniques used to construct objects in Life that behave in interesting and unusual ways: 
1) We can write a computer program that searches for patterns with particular properties; 
2) we can combine different already-known objects in such a way as to create new composite objects; or 
3) we can put some random garbage on the Life board and evolve it, with the hope that something interesting pops out. 
Option (1) typically requires a fair bit of effort[…] option (2) is not yet possible for us […] We thus start with the extremely not clever option (3). I can succeed. I will succeed. I must succeed. But so must the other guy. The Yankees pray to God: “Lord, please grant us the strength and resolve to do our best…” But so do the Braves. And someone has to lose. Skill aside, what might aid in determining the loser is this: Who has the need to lose more? 1970 – Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman create Scheme. Their work leads to a series of “Lambda the Ultimate” papers culminating in “Lambda the Ultimate Kitchen Utensil.”

I tend to talk about friend groups a lot on the blogs. I’ve always been someone that has traveled in a pack. In high school, I had a group of three girls I hung out with a lot and I felt like I understood them on a near-cosmic level, like soulmates for friends. That was until we inevitably fell out and started on our different paths. In my freshman year of college, I had  , an acronym of all of our friends’ names put together. I was so surprised I was so easily able to form a friend group, having been scarred from my previous friend group encounter. I felt like I had finally gotten it right. Until two of our friends dated and then consequently broke up and we all moved to different dorms and eventually stopped talking. Then, my junior year I thought I had   gotten it right. The group was now smaller to about 6 of us and it felt solid. This is it, I thought. These are the lifelong friendships they talk about in the movies. Until the person I considered my best friend stopped talking to me because his girlfriend didn’t like the fact that we were talking and I spent the entire semester wondering if I did something wrong. Entering my senior year, I thought to myself   this is it. My best friend is talking to me again. Our group has grown a little bigger, but that’s okay. But I still found myself dissatisfied. I looked around and felt that
 
I wasn’t happy with the people I’ve surrounded myself with. ⁠ 01 A little brave to post this on a public platform where any of them can read this, huh? Perhaps that’s an exaggeration. I love my friends to death and I’ve always characterized myself as someone not only fiercely loyal, but someone who prides myself in having the best friends in the world. This semester, I felt a cold and sobering moment as I sat in my friend’s dorm room in the late drips of the night, chatting away. I remember sitting there and looking at my friend and his friend next to him and thinking of how much I didn’t recognize the person across from me. How he’s changed so drastically from the person I met in my freshman year to the person that sits with me now.  I think.  My friend Emma describes this as the end of the honeymoon phase, a phase often attributed to the early part of a couple’s relationship where everything is incredibly positive. Emma says the same thing applies to friendships, too. As my senior fall concludes and my last semester waits around the corner, I’ve been thinking about relationships a lot. I find it interesting and exciting that these people are the ones I might tell my kids about, the “college friends” that will inevitably pop up in all of my stories of my college shenanigans. And as a result, I’ve been thinking about the people I want to surround myself with. Recently at a late night conversation, we were
 
discussing all the things we didn’t like about our friends. ⁠ 02 In a healthy, accountable way. This is a good thing to do. “He tends to ignore people if they have nothing interesting to say, particularly women” versus “She was somewhat difficult to deal with while going through her breakup.” “He surrounds himself with questionable people that make me feel uncomfortable and unsafe at parties” versus “She sometimes is very sensitive and we have to be extra mindful of our words.” “He has a habit of getting physically violent when he’s upset or angry” versus “She sometimes is really needy.” And I stared at the ceiling in somber realization. The bar is in hell and I am complacent. My freshman year I remember being so in awe of how I managed to find such   guys. “They don’t make problematic jokes!” I excitedly exclaimed to no one in particular. “They don’t make gay jokes or racist jokes or sexist jokes.
 
They’re generally respectful of me ⁠ 03 Now this part can't even be said for all of them. There’s a common trend on TikTok of girls asking their guy best friends what they really think of women and then usually posting screenshots of themselves crying after they read the answer. I feel similarly. I think it needs to be said that my friends aren’t outrightly or outrageously horrible people, but I think I’ve come to the somewhat (basic) conclusion that I truly am not an   in their eyes. I sometimes feel as though I am just an option for my male friends. That my worth is inherently tied to the fact that I am a “maybe” fuck for them. And when I express that I don’t have feelings for them or that this is not going to go anywhere, but I really would love to be friends, they disappear from my life just as quickly as they appeared. Or other times, I am only respected by my male best friends   I am not being pursued by them. Only when I have no sexual appeal to offer them do they finally treat me as one of them. That I am able to be seen as full and human. I recently described my feelings about the whole ordeal as if I am “in a
 
parasocial relationship” ⁠ 04 a one sided relationship where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party is completely unaware I don’t quite know what to do. Or what to make of it. Often times, the Internet is quick to tell you to cut them. To drop them and move on. And while I’m usually a proponent of this advice, I find it hard to do so when I have so much emotional investment in the relationship. I do not believe my friends to be bad people. I believe their actions can be rectified. But to what extent do they want to change? What extent are they receptive to my feedback? To what extent is it even any of my  if we are no longer best friends? If this is the life that they’ve just chosen to lead? On a deeper level, I feel a much more palpable fear now that this is my fate. That the men in my life are now destined to be this. To be, for lack of more apt words, disappointing. That the best I can hope for is that they don’t say slurs or make insensitive jokes, but they’ll always still lean into that feral man side of them that will look at me like some object. Or tie my value to my attractiveness. 
Will I ever meet another man who will make me feel whole? ⁠ 05 For what it's worth, Raymond does make me feel whole. I feel like a person around him. He holds me in incredibly high regard, and I appreciate it so much. I feel a bitterness and a rage as I think of all of this. That when I think of the shortcomings of my female friends, they often are attributed   men. That the onslaught of emotional instability results from the treatment they received from a man. From the neglect they felt from a man. The dismissal of a man. And it irks me that this is simple reality, what people would treat as nature simply running its course. Boys will be boys, they say. Sometimes, when I’m being silly and fantasizing, I think about what life would be like in the future, if I were ever to have children. And then a horrible sinking feeling sinks in my stomach as I think about everything I’ve had to endure as a woman. The way at age 8 I was criticized for the way my body looked, for not being as skinny or as pretty as the other girls. The way that at age 12 I was told I had dick-sucking lips by someone I had viewed as a near father figure. The way at age 15 someone took a photo of someone touching my ass and spread it around the school for everyone to look at. The way at even now, at age 20, I had someone tell me “You know, Cami, I totally   but out of respect for  , I won’t.” So how could I? How could I willingly and knowingly bring a person into this Earth knowing that they could fall to the same fate? I don’t know. I really don’t know.

Song:  Ramblings of a Lunatic by Bears In Trees Two months ago, I wrote about  four-dimensional worms  Specifically, the philosophical notion that people exist  through  time in the same way we do in space (for instance, younger you is a  part of you I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently when it comes to Decisions, both yours and… y’know… not yours. See with this notion, to recap from my other post, comes the idea that you are who you were (i.e. yourself any time in the past), but you aren’t yet who you will become. And, as a consequence, who you become is deeply entangled with every version of yourself throughout time, for better or for worse. I applied to be a blogger for MITAdmissions two times before I was accepted. The first time I was rejected, I felt like I had done something wrong. Like my four months (albeit a short amount of time) of blogging was for nothing because it didn’t pay off in the way I had wanted it to. And I   wanted it to pay off. I put a piece of myself into that application, one that was fragile and vulnerable. So when I wasn’t accepted, I felt this “piece” breaking, just a little bit. I was sad. 
I felt hollow. 
And a part of me wanted to stop writing entirely for a month. I thought back to all of the things I had done leading up to the first application. I had worked so hard, and for good reason. I liked writing. So, keeping that in mind, I pushed forward out of spite. I planned to apply again the following year. The second time I wasn’t accepted, I had more writing experience to reflect upon. I had been blogging for over a year. And over that year, the spite transformed into passion.   My four-dimensional worm included a year of writing. I still felt a bit hollow as I did the first time. But this time, I knew more about who I was and am. I’m usually the sort of person to either hold onto a passion so hard that it becomes a big part of my life, or I let it fall to the wayside after a short period of time. This has been true about mathematics in my life, it’s been true about my love of education, and,  , it was true about my blogging. And that passion, wasn’t going to go away any time soon. The piece of yourself that you put into your application to MIT, if you chose to apply, likely highlights your passion for  .   Sure, there might be people who don’t get why it’s your passion (cough cough every person who tells me they hate math)– but   get it. You might’ve even had this passion for most of your life. It might feel like something you did was wrong if this passion didn’t pay off in a way you had envisioned. But what I want to tell you, is that you didn’t do anything wrong. 
All of you went out onto a limb when you applied here  . There might be a voice in the back of your mind telling you that “maybe you shouldn’t even have applied”, but really, that version of yourself no longer can feasibly exist. The version of you that chose to apply and did/didn’t get in/got deferred, is a part of who you are now. It’ll stay with you. That might feel terrifying right now, especially if the results make you feel sad or a bit hollow, but I choose to believe that this is just one moment. Just one three-dimensional slice of your constantly expanding four-dimensional worm. And where you go from here, is up to you. Evaluate your passions. Why did you start loving them in the first place if you ever did? Does this passion light a fire in you to keep pushing forward, usually? I mean sure, right now it might feel like the fire is a bit dimmer than normal, but if it makes you happy, keep pursuing it. If nothing else, out of spite. There are so many places to pursue your dreams, and you will find your own. And one day, that spite might turn into a true, unwavering,  , part of yourself. Song:  Everybody Wants to Rule The World  by Tears for Fears “Whichever choice [they] make, [they’re] going to end up a different person.” –Petey circa 2016 in one of my favorite  Admissions blogposts The reason I think about life through these worms so much, is because I’m someone with a lot of regrets and worries. I try not to be, but my brain just likes to poke and prod and ask “what if instead you had chosen to not do *insert thing that became a fundamental part of my identity and life*.” But the worms keep this part of myself in check. Because I’m not who I could’ve been. I will never be. Sure, you can change paths, though sometimes the path you want to take lies in the hands of other people. But the *pure fact* that you’re going through what you’re going through right now, means that it’s going to stick with you. It stays a part of your four-dimensional worm. You may wish, as humans are often inclined to do, that you could know each and every possibility before you make any decisions, but you can’t be everything all at once. You can just be you. Right now, right here. That doesn’t make the grieving/wondering over different paths any easier right now, but hopefully (and I am optimistic this is so) one day it will be. And you’ll look back on your four-dimensional worm and think about how much you’ve grown. Writing has become a part of my life in ways I haven’t quite expected. At first it was a fun little hobby during the pandemic, but really I was gearing up for four straight years of  MATH . But then I found myself writing more and more. I got to use my thoughts on math and philosophy and emotions to create a lens I can use to view my worm. I get to see how I’ve changed over time. I get to remember the good  and  the bad. MIT, and I imagine life in general, is really  hard , y’know? For many reasons. But for one thing, you can’t do everything. You can’t take  every class getting sick feeling alone or sad  within your control. It’s within my control to write about four-dimensional worms. It’s within my control to take four cool math classes in the spring. It’s within my control to try and do things I feel passionate about. With the many things out of your control, keep in mind what is within your control too. I leave you with one of my favorite quotes. “Believe in yourselves. Dream. Try. Do good.” 
“Don’t you mean do well?” 
“No… I mean, do  ” — . You’re going to do great things. #multidimensional #worm

MIT Early Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2027 are now available in the application portal . To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update.  This year, 11,924 students applied early to the MIT Class of 2027, and as of  *checks watch*  right now , we have offered early admission to 685. Though they are all different in their own way —  muralists and mountaineers, locksmiths and lifeguards, baristas and blacksmiths  — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with MIT’s  mission  to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to campus to join the 4,638 outstanding undergraduates already enrolled at MIT.  We
 
deferred 7,892 applicants; ⁠ 01 I know this looks like a large number, and it is. As a matter of philosophy, we have typically preferred to defer, rather than deny, a majority of our early applicants, because we want to make the most informed decision we can; the disruptions of the pandemic have only increased our inclination in this regard. more information for deferred students here ; you can also read posts from bloggers who were deferred  here ,  here , here ,  here , and most recently  here  and  here .   Given the competitiveness of our pool, we have also informed 2,815 students that we will not be able to offer them admission this year. This decision has been made with care, and it is final. I know this can be a difficult decision to receive, but trust me: it  works out okay in the end . Take a deep breath,  shake it out , and go crush the rest of your college applications (or whatever else you choose to do) this year. The balance of our applicants —  532 —  withdrew from our process before we issued their decision.   We recognize it’s a lot of effort for all of you to apply to MIT. It’s an  honor and a privilege  for us to read your applications. Thank you for sharing your story with us.  Again, congratulations to the newest members of the Class of 2027. I’ll be closing comments on this post to focus the conversations on the open threads for  admitted deferred not admitted All best, everyone; wishing you a healthy and happy end of 2022, and bright beginnings to 2023.

If your decision was deferred, then we will reconsider your application anew and without prejudice in Regular Action. Many MIT students were initially deferred; you can read some of their experiences  here here here Some of you may feel happy to be deferred. Some of you may feel sad. Some of you may have complicated feelings that you don’t know how to name; that’s okay, too. more information on next steps for deferred students here

at the beginning of the semester i wrote a post where i mentioned that i was taking the class  nanotechnology: from atoms to systems (6.2540)  because it was one of the few mit courses offered this semester that felt like magic to me – in the sense that the material was so far beyond my comprehension that it was indistinguishable from magic. that turned out to be a good decision, as 6.2540 is now one of my three favorite technical classes i’ve taken at mit, along with  molecular basis of infectious disease (7.26)  and  computation structures (6.1910/6.004) at a high level, the lectures cover optics, quantum mechanics, their relationship to materials science and engineering, and fabrication technologies; then there are weekly labs where you make spectrometers, quantum dots, leds, and sensors. for the last month you work on a project where you fabricate something of your choice (anything is fine as long as it has an important component whose width is less than 10 nanometers). my group chose to make tandem solar cells, which basically means making two complementary solar cells that can be stacked in a way which increases power generation without taking up more land area by the way, if you’re curious what the single most mind-blowing moment from the course was, for me it was when we drew the energy diagrams for the components of solar cells and LEDs and saw that they were the exact same: i’m not going to talk much about the science or tools or fabrication processes in this post, mostly because there’s too much technical background to explain. for now i’ll just say that you can deposit thin layers of metal via sputtering, and you can deposit thin layers of other materials by suspending them in solution, spinning droplets rapidly to create a thin film, and then boiling away the solvent arguably more important than the technical details is that 6.2540 is the only technical class i’ve ever taken which has left me feeling genuinely hopeful and optimistic afterwards. i’ve enrolled in many math and cs and biology and music classes, and a lot of them have been great in the sense that they’ve been enlightening or have taught me specific skills, but usually it’s not clear why we should care about the problems we’re studying other than that they’re interesting. by contrast, with nanotech: solar cells are heavy, which makes them expensive to transport and complicates installation as they require a well-supported roof. while working on the final project, our ta showed us a prototype of a flexible printable solar cell he was developing, and then we saw videos of how these ultra-thin cells are being deployed to drastically improve the feasibility of solar power in developing countries around a third of produce in the usa is thrown out before it can be sold, because supply chains don’t have a way of figuring out which produce is closer to ripening. in one of the labs we built an alcohol sensor, and then we discussed how a similar device could be designed to produce cheap ethylene sensors and how an mit nano startup is using these ideas to minimize food waste there were quite a few other examples such as covid testing and reducing pesticide runoff that i won’t go into in the current era of environmental and climate doomerism, 6.2540 is the first convincing proof i’ve seen that we can actually solve climate change and issues surrounding sustainability. i have never been more confident that we can find engineering solutions to our problems if we choose to dedicate our lives to them. it’s hard not to be convinced when you’re surrounded by faculty and grad students who are making meaningful progress, and when they can actually explain their work to you and show you, a student new to the field, how to use the same tools they use in a digestible manner. for that reason alone i’m very grateful to have taken this class

“It’s just a few more weeks,” my mom told me, on the phone, as I hurried down the Infinite and out into the cold. “Junior year is your hardest year.” She told me this five years ago, back in 11th grade. “You work harder in high school than college,” she said; she had, as a math major at a tech school in the ‘80’s. When was the hardest that I worked? I told myself, in freshman spring, that I would never take 4.67 classes and a UROP all at once again (because come sophomore fall I’d take six classes and a UROP instead, and join several new communities, and addict myself to new sources of caffeine).  When we stress-test welds in shop we weld two pieces of steel together, then clamp one down and slam the other with a hammer until something bends.  I remember going on a run just as the snow was melting and the baby geese were coming out. “Objectively you have a limit,” I thought to myself. “Somewhere north of four classes and south of sixteen. You don’t  need  to find it. You don’t have to watch yourself break.” But I enjoy — of  course  I enjoy, at this place — the feeling of thinking something is impossible, and then doing it anyway. Sometimes even doing it well. It’s my addiction, every semester telling myself, ‘no way in hell this will work.’  I know all my little justifications: that I can’t write consistently at MIT anyway so why not do *everything* else to make up for it, that this is my one chance to take a lot of cool classes, HASS classes aren’t  that  much work, et cetera.  I’d also applied for many classes which historically had low acceptance rates: a lotteried MIT writing workshop, a few Harvard writing workshops, 3.096: blacksmithing, and How to Make Almost Anything. I got into all but the last one. I figured I would take as many as I
 
could, ⁠ 01 the MIT workshop clashed with something else On top of that, of course I know a small handful of people who are taking more classes than this, and still find time to be in clubs and socialize. There are people who are taking many classes and also pour time and energy into a UROP. Many people, regardless of classes, put time into clubs and exercise when I cannot seem to find any time. I know that each person has their own limits, but part of me always protests, maybe these people don’t just absorb content faster or get through psets
 
efficiently; ⁠ 02 ”though This summer I felt happier than I had in a long time, more put-together, whole. The world felt right for the first time since covid ripped me away from Europe years ago. This came partially from having time to sleep and run and work on projects, the way that one cannot do at MIT in general, but especially not when one is taking 5-7 classes. I wrote two dozen poems and a small handful of stories, and came back to MIT in summer. Everything was green, so green it shocked me.  I’m happier than I was, I reasoned. Therefore I can take more classes than before! :D This was very good and solid logic, so I registered for eight classes. Then I had to drop one because it unexpectedly had mandatory attendance and overlapped with another mandatory attendance class. So I only had seven classes. I do not take pictures of work apparently but here is me holding two monsters I really liked those classes. I’m learning about Celtic folklore and picking up a lot of writing tips from my Harvard writing workshop. I spend three hours each week discussing poetry. I made a sword with a dragon head for a hilt. I read about 100 pages per week, 70 when I was slacking. I pulled my first pset-induced all-nighter this September, my second in October. By now, I’ve lost count. Each week I have three days blocked off where no people can squeeze in, and the following two days are frequently a sleep-deprived haze. On the weekends I collect myself and start the work again. Lather, rinse, repeat. Last night, at 6 am — I’d finished a pset at 5, but I’d drunk half a Monster to do so, so my brain was skittery and wouldn’t fall asleep — I looked in the mirror and thought, “this is the hardest I’ve ever worked.” I don’t know if that’s true — how does this compare against my 5-class freshman spring, when I could only talk to my pod? I felt like I was working harder then, since I didn’t have a wider social scene to take breaks with. I thought that sophomore year might be my hardest, since I was taking 5-6 classes of all-new content, and 2.007 conquered a good quarter of my life. I’m not trying as hard on psets this semester, but I seem to be spending more time doing work nonetheless. Maybe there is more work. For the first time since freshman year I’m completing nearly every assigned reading. Maybe this  is  my hardest semester. I’ve noticed this pattern in myself before but only recently have I come to see it as not just a strength, but a double-edged sword. It’s good that I can manage this workload, and it’s lovely that I care. I feel secure, knowing that if I choose to, I can graduate a semester early or drop any class that is particularly nasty. On the other hand, I feel like I’m one rough semester away from burnout.  The most frustrating times are when, in the middle of Celtic Folklore or Writing & Retelling Fairy Tales, I get a good idea for something to write, or a new way of seeing one of the stories I’m playing with. I scribble it down, look at it in a few different ways, and think,  I’ll elaborate on this tonight  before realizing that no, I won’t, I’ll be coding. And the next night I’ll be writing equations for some mass-spring-damper system, et cetera, et cetera. I will not in fact have time to let these ideas ferment and grow until winter break.  We live in a culture that values hard work and productivity. I often say MIT enables us to lean into that even more; it creates this bread-and-circuses of money and workshops to make projects and free food to gobble up. There are posters in the gym that say things like ‘8 hours of sleep are important!’ but the structure of this place makes 8 hours seem
 
luxurious. ⁠ 03 opinions are my own, of course. There are students who prioritize work-life balance differently than I do and carve out schedules with more time for cooking, sleeping, etc I like MIT’s culture; it suits me. If I didn’t go here, I’d probably be doing about as much work, but it would be harder to do in a culture where that is the exception instead of the rule. Even so, right now? I need to step back from the grind just a little. During seasons of writing, when my output is ~8-10 pages per day, I don’t feel exhausted. I know that I cannot write on little sleep so I take care of my body. That sounds kinda fun! I kinda miss it. I seem to hit this near-burnout place at least once per semester. Sometimes it takes me sticking my hand into fire multiple times before I look at the bubbled scars and realize, yep, that burned. I’m hoping that now, finally, I can teach myself to schedule in rest. I’m planning my classes for next semester, blocking out bigger chunks of time to run or work out. I’m trying to make my schedule more flexible so that I can join more impromptu social activities without missing out on work. I’m planning to take a day or two of rest, instead of having a day or two become unproductive due to sheer exhaustion. I’ll absorb the classes I do take more deeply. I think it will be elucidating. We’ll report back on that in spring.

The MIT Monologues (MITMo) is a spinoff of the play   by Eve Ensler, talking about the intersections of sex, gender, relationships, disability, sexuality, etc. written by people with marginalized genders. Before, the cast performed both pieces from the   themselves and some written pieces, but since last year our pieces are all separate from the original piece. Amber  wrote This year I decided to write another monologue to give at the performance, and though it’ll probably be a bit different during the performance for any number of reasons, I really like how this turned out. In this piece, I talk about my experience as a transgender person at MIT. The one thing I just want to say is that the memories I discuss are simply the ones that have resulted in “ ” conflicting feelings I think are interesting to hear about in a performance piece. I didn’t include the numerous amazing and embracing memories of my time at MIT because I feel that’s already talked about quite a lot. To name a few of these memories: What I’m trying to say, is that at MIT I’ve been able to feel  . Most times for the better. Sometimes for the worse. Take of that what you will. In any case, the rest of this blogpost is meant to be a mock-up of my monologue for the MIT Monologues this year (including some stage directions). In reality, about half of it will probably be cut for time but this is the amount of detail I wanted for this blog at least. I’ve included annotations to provide some context for some of the parts that may be a little bit confusing if you are a reader who doesn’t currently attend MIT. Feel free to leave questions in the comments. My first year, I distinctly remember sitting on the couch scrolling through the various club
 
dormspam, ⁠ 01 emails sent to all dorms emails that were flooding in. I was reading each and every one carefully to find one or two to join.  One for a math group, one that plays video games, one for a dance group, another for a dance group,   danc– No one ever tells you this, but your first year you can feel like you’re completely restarting socially. Sure, most every other first year is struggling socially  with you , like a bunch of baby deer on a frozen lake downstream of the firehose, but knowing that doesn’t clearly  help  much now does it? And all I wanted my first year, was to feel like a part of something. To feel included. So here I am, swiping through club emails.  One for 
dormcon, ⁠ 02 Dormitory Council  one for The Tech, one for an acapella group,   for an acapella group,  
for an aca- ⁠ 03 to be clear, the joke here is that there are numerous dance teams and acapella groups who heavily advertise their clubes Then there was one that caught my eye in particular: ( hand gestures in the air) The Vagina Monologues , ran by MIT The F-word. I  really  wanted to join, but alas  I  do not have a Vagina. Now granted,   were named as such based on a play by the same name, and the club certainly didn’t say in big bold letters “Prerequisite: Must Have Vagina”, but I worried about what might happen; what people might say, and the pain that would follow. So, I deleted the email, and moved on with my baby-deer-life. A year later, and
 
yet another email entered my inbox ⁠ 04 because of course, when do the emails ever stop being sent or received? advertising:  (hand gestures again) The MIT Monologues.  And with the removal of the word Vagina, I joined the group to write and perform a piece. At first, I wanted to write about my experience as a transwoman. But I kept sitting down to write and constantly was on the verge of  tears  and  anger  (for reasons I’ll get into later). So ultimately, I switched gears and wrote about chronic pain in the piece  Crisp  that we just heard (insert name here) perform. And I love this piece, don’t get me wrong. But it wasn’t what I wanted to write about at first  
where that piece would end up. ⁠ 05 it felt like I had let that previous version of myself down. So about a month ago, I sat down and wrote various memories I might want to talk about in this hypothetical piece. In the end, I had eight specific memories and I didn’t want to part with any of them. Without further ado, here are: 8 Distinct Memories as a Transwoman (at MIT) (ordered loosely by intensity) I’ve always loved math, and I came out as trans in high school. Yet still, it took me until my sophomore year to realize that I’m a woman in STEM. When I realized this, there was this bittersweet feeling in my throat I couldn’t quite shake for a while. Over time, this fact has made me really happy though. Whenever I meet someone new who clocks me as some amount of Gay, they almost always ask if I live at
 
Random or EC. ⁠ 06 Random and EC sometimes get a reputation as having immense 'counter culture' and being a safe haven for people who are different. And while these dorms do provide some amount of that to a diverse range of students, there is a stereotype that all LGBTQ+ people live in these two dorms, which they do not. I laugh it off in that way you acknowledge and partially enforce annoying stereotypes, but really I just want to shout: NEXT QUEER AND THRIVING. thankyouverymuch! Though I only came out as trans in high school, I knew I was some amount of queer (not a bad word implicitly) since middle school when someone sat me down and told me that being in color guard made me gay. Still, I never fully felt comfortable with this huge part of my identity until I was kissing someone who had never known me before transitioning. I was 18. I never know whether to put my legal name or my Actual Name on forms when applying for summer research. And to be clear– it is my  Actual Name – not “Preferred”; it’s the name I use for myself. Anyways, when it comes to these forms, no one ever tells you directly what to do. When I asked for advice, many just told me to do what felt right– but  nothing  felt right. I didn’t want to  
“take” some other person’s spot ⁠ 07 i.e. internalized transphobia on my part, not that I actually would be taking a spot from anyone somehow, but I also didn’t want to diminish my  identity . And the forms aren’t inclusive enough to ask the  right questions  that would actually make them accessible to all applicants. My first year, I didn’t apply to any summer programs. (digression– should be reflected in movement on stage)  Being trans can lead to a thousand double-edged swords that lightly poke at you throughout the day. All you want– all anyone wants– is to be included. But instead, my brain creates a false dichotomy. Either I simply don’t join the Monologues, or I get treated weirdly for being trans. Either I simply ignore microaggressions, or I do something wrong and feel bad. My brain tells me to exclude  myself  before others can exclude  me . Behind the stall door of some of the bathrooms of
 
McCormick, ⁠ 08 an all-women's only dorm which creates it's own interesting culture, social dynamics, and false stereotypes as a result of this living situation  there’s a faintly yellowing paper entitled “Young Ladies Etiquette”, held up by what must be the strongest piece of Scotch Tape I’ve ever seen (both via the title and the coloration). The sign has ‘rules’ like “Remove your hair from the shower walls” and “  While at home you may have ‘If it’s yellow let it mellow’, here always be sure to flush!”.  After months of staring at this weirdly patronizing piece of paper, (slowly with emphasis) I gingerly removed it… crumpled it up… and threw it into the trash along with the hair from my just-taken-shower. I hated this sign. Because in  what  world would there be a “Young Gentleman’s Etiquette” with ‘rules’ like “Make sure to shave daily!” and “Don’t pee on the toilet seat!” in a men’s only dorm? I sometimes wonder if I only thought to simply throw it out since I’m trans. I’ve often wondered if, since I’m trans, my opinion on this should be taken into account at all. Maybe this wasn’t my place. Maybe I shouldn’t have thrown it out in the first place. Speaking of McCormick, while I was living there I did some research into the trans policies they have in place– the end result being  none . Not that, in the bylaws, trans people can live there nor that they can’t–  simply nothing in the bylaws at all I sent out a Google form. It only had three questions:  On a scale of 1-5, how supportive would you generally say you are of transgender and nonbinary individuals. Do you personally know transgender students at MIT that do not live at McCormick? and a  
Feels Box, ⁠ 09 i.e. a comments box, commonly included at the very end of forms sent out to mailing lists Though simple– perhaps too simple– the responses were interesting. For the first question, most students said they were supportive (i.e. a 5); which I relatively expected. The second question was slightly more interesting. Only 60% of students said they knew a transperson outside of McCormick, and of the remaining 40%, 25% said they explicitly didn’t know any transpeople outside of McCormick. But the truly most interesting responses were from the few people who filled out the feels box. Because while some people thought the data/responses would be “useful reassurance” of how welcoming McCormick can be of trans-students, other responses were worse. One said they were afraid to be sleeping with a penis down their hall. Another said transwomen should only be allowed to live at McCormick if they’ve done x, y, z medical procedures. And one said that “If you are considering allowing transgender students to live in McCormick,… that makes me, as a biological female very very uncomfortable and betrayed as a woman.” I moved to Next House that fall. This year I went to the hospital for a week for my mental health. The first two days I mostly slept. The first thing I did on the third day? I looked at my medical bracelet– the thing that gets me meds and is supposed to “protect” me– and felt my heart drop. I immediately took a pen, and scratched out my legal name. I wondered if anyone noticed. I worried someone did. My piece from last year,  , is on my chronic pain. Pain and pain expression has always been a sore topic for me to grapple with. Because on the one hand, I’m always in pain, but on the other, I try not to show it. This causes an immense amount of gender dysphoria for me. Because it’s stereotypically “masculine” to hide the fact that you’re hurting, and I can’t just awkwardly laugh away this stereotype. I couldn’t get myself to write about being trans, because it felt like I was trying to validate my role in the Monologues itself. I was explaining why my experiences as a transwoman are implicitly experiences of a woman. I was trying to explain why I should be included. And I felt so sad and angry that I even  should have to . So, I didn’t. After the first of our few rehearsals with the entire Monologues cast the week before our performances, someone messaged me on Discord asking “What does your piece have to do with gender/sex?” I felt hurt, and frustrated, and excluded. Ultimately, this was one of many nights this year I got cried. One of many nights, I felt alone. — So there we go. Eight distinct memories as a transwoman. Are you happy? Am I included now? Please? ##mitmonologues

26-100 ⁠ 01 a lecture hall Black Panther 2 had been on LSC’s radar since the beginning of the semester. We knew for sure it was something we wanted to screen, either early or not. We had been working with a local publicity agency to see if we could arrange something, but as this process was going on, it turned out that MIT was also in talks with Disney for a general private screening. With some negotiation and back and forth, MIT’s Division of Student Life (DSL) and MIT’s Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagements committee (SOLE) worked with LSC to set up the screening. This consisted of various audio and visual checks from Boston Light and Sound, projector checks (we had to bring a new projector courtesy of Disney since our specs weren’t up to desired standard). Once this was all set up, we were able to get ready for the screening. During this screening, we had free popcorn and waters for all invited, courtesy of Disney’s sponsorship. As a refreshments worker, we made 5-6 batches of popcorn in advance to prepare for the onslaught of folks that would be coming in. I worked with five or six other staff members to make and distribute popcorn as well as water during the initial downtime before the screening. We had a near full house in 26-100 and it was really just an incredible moment to see our school on the big screen. So many people dropped in to view the show, students and faculty alike. 
It was really gratifying to be able to bring something so meaningful and fun to the MIT community and I’m so happy I’m able to participate in such cool and fun things through LSC :) You can read the MIT News Office’s article on this event here. #black panther 2

In sixth grade, even if you had a crush on someone, you would never ask them out. The reasoning was simple: it was embarrassing and high-risk. The potential outcomes weren’t  and  but rather  and  . You’d exposed your own vulnerability and hadn’t even gotten any benefit out of it. And middle school students were vicious. Pretty much everyone has passed through this phase of life, which is why I have always found the advice “the worst thing that can happen is they say no, which is the same result as if you never ask” to be bizarre. The worst thing that can happen is much worse than a simple  . Don’t we all know this by now? And okay, we aren’t eleven years old anymore, so the costs are  . If I were to ask someone out now, maybe it is true that I’m exposing myself to much less risk these days. But there are other circumstances, too, in which the cost of trying for something is much higher than simply hearing a  . If I invest time and energy into a job application, only to not get the job, that is time and energy I could’ve spent elsewhere. Worse, I might get blacklisted from the company (this has happened a few times when I didn’t perform well in a technical interview) and never receive another chance. I have a guy friend who still doesn’t ask women out, due to fear of being labelled as creepy. For similar reasons (with the bonus fear of getting hate-crimed), I don’t approach women if I’m unsure about their sexual orientation. And I confess that rejection can bother me: if I ask a question in a group chat and nobody responds, the perceived social rejection feels bad. Once, I spent an entire summer at an internship and didn’t get a return offer, and that rejection hurt because it felt like all the time I had given this company was wasted. Since this is on the admissions blog and it is December, some of you might be considering a different possibility of rejection. Here is an anecdote from my college-application era, which now feels like half a lifetime ago: when I was applying to schools, there was a school where I withdrew my application before receiving my decision, because I had a feeling I was going to get rejected and I didn’t want to give them the chance to do so. That’s silly hubris, right? It doesn’t matter that much now, because I got into MIT which I would’ve chosen over that school anyway, but still, what was the point of withdrawing? I know some people have thicker skin than me, but a lot of growing up has been about realizing that I am not other people, I can only ever be myself, and I can’t learn to handle a tendency of mine if I’m trying to deny it even exists. So I try to be realistic about the costs of rejection. Dismissing my own feelings (“oh, I shouldn’t be scared of feeling disappointed/sad/etc.”) creates an inaccurate portrayal of the risks. Instead, I factor them in, but I also weigh them appropriately. There’s no point in making myself feel bad for no reason, so maybe I won’t ask a question in a class group chat if I can get the information elsewhere, but also, sometimes it’s worth feeling bad for opportunities that are potentially high-reward. Honestly, I still could be better at dealing with rejection; I don’t apply to jobs unless I’m extremely qualified for them, I get anxious over asking for things I want. But if I ever want to get to anywhere meaningful, I have to confront the risk of rejection.

as an obsessive Spotify user, it’s only fitting that i finish my last year of blogging with another blogger wrapped. these have become a consistent tradition, and if I had to guess, they’ll continue for a while, considering how most of the bloggers listen to more music than ~95% of their respective countries. here are the previous editions, if you’re interested: 2021 2020 2019 2018 let’s start with some stats! MG has literally always been on top. slay fatima did a lot of listening to TSwift this year, it seems! tbh so did everyone, so that’s very understandable. the top two for top artist minutes listened are on the lower end here, but MG and I are somehow also at the far right? it’s the sheer amount of Spotify usage, I guess…I’m on Spotify more than any social media, I have hundreds of playlists, and I’m very diligent about listening to music constantly. I also listened to an album every day this year (post coming soon), so this checks out. MG and I at the top again! let’s go musical diversity :) I can attest to my constant switching between psychedelic rock/hyperpop/rap/anime openings… alternatively titled: how much were you going through it this year indie pop was this prevalent last year, too. dance pop is much less common, although I think that’s because Spotify changed around their genre designations.   top genre last year was dance pop, for some reason. wow, look how accomplished we all are! ah yes, more personality data for us to hyper-fixate on! thanks for keeping us entertained with random new information each year, Spotify. they justify this music-personality-test thing with: Do you mostly listen to the same artists over and over (and over) again, or are you constantly on the hunt for something new? How about when it comes to classic tracks or recent releases? With music, everyone listens just a little bit differently, which is something 2022 Wrapped celebrates. In your personalized Wrapped experience, you may have noticed a new feature: Your Listening Personality. there are four categories with two indicators each, making for 16 total personality types. the axes are:  — do you listen to your favorite artists on repeat, or sample a lot of new ones?  — do you play the same songs over and over, or have a more diverse selection of music?  — do you listen to new music when it releases, or prefer to just listen to music from any period?  — do you listen to mostly popular artists, or look deeper for less well known ones?  —

I rapidly switch between wanting to do something and not wanting to do anything at all, panic, and calm apathy, terror at the prospect of failing, and falling back on P/NR. Sometimes I just can’t find the motivation to do things. I was given weeks, but only paid my pistol club dues the very last day. I was supposed to send the email requesting an interview on Wednesday, but only clicked the button today. I’m supposed to take the midterm today in two hours and 19 minutes, as of the moment I’m writing this of course. But I can’t find the motivation to study. The grandfather clock has swung the wrong way, and I can barely pick up my apple pencil to work out more than a fifth of a problem. The grind started Tuesday evening with a breakdown in Walker Memorial, and when I got back, I finally calmed down enough to work. And then the next day I was working, but I was slowing down. I got distracted quite a bit, but still managed to review all the both the past midterm problems and the midterm review problems. But TICK the pendulum swung and I couldn’t do anything. It wasn’t immediate. Yesterday, I got through a lot fewer of the practice problems. I didn’t have many classes, so I definitely had time. The panic I felt Tuesday night was fading, and though I knew logically in my head, that I had to practice to even have a chance at passing, and that I was nowhere close to ready, I was tired already. I took a nap. I got up and tried to go back to scribbling my notes on Procreate. . So I figured I might need another break. When I heard that a bunch of my friends were invited to go eat at Maseeh dining, I wanted to tap myself in so I could hang out with them. We squished together into a huge, poorly-designed table, and ate. I had to crawl out the bottom any time I wanted to refill my drink or get another plate of sushi. I stuffed myself, went back home, and tried to work and it didn’t work. I ended up spending a few hours with a bunch of people on hall unlocking a mysterious fancy lock capsule I found on the Florey free food table. It was poorly designed enough that we could work it out by feel, and unscrew the screws holding it together. Once we could pull the end out far enough, we unlocked it and reset the combination. It had six letters, so feel free to take a wild guess what we set the new password to. I didn’t end up working that night. I woke up today at 9:14am without an alarm, and decided to skip the chem lecture so I can try to study. . It didn’t work. I did the only the first part of about 6 different practice problems and gave up on finishing it halfway through. Only after 12ish did I realized I hadn’t yet brushed my teeth. It’s 1:04pm right now, and the clock’s going to keep steadily counting down until I have to walk up to that godforsaken test room on the third floor of Walker Memorial and cry internally for 50 minutes as I work through problems I should have practiced more. Through trying to work and not working through my poorly-designed attempt to study for the midterm, I realized that there’s really no way around it. The grandfather clock is going to keep ticking in non-Newtonian time, and the simple harmonic oscillations of the pendulum is going to keep whacking the sides of my brain, annoyingly flipping the switch on and off and on and off and on and off between panic and apathy. It’s 1:12 pm right now, I have 48 minutes to grab a snack and continue trying to cram. —time skip— The exam went about as (not) well as I thought it would, and I lost one less point than I thought I would (I did a small bit of score calculation at the end of the exam), but still passed. And like clockwork, the chem midterm rolled around, so the pendulum kept swinging. Calm on Tuesday, panic starts Wednesday, calm for about 5 hours on Thursday, panic the entire morning before the test, calm during the test, panic after the test. Some upperclassmen have told me, if you’re not barely passing your classes, you’re not doing it right. And so I followed their advice. I tried to make the most out of my freshman year and overloaded myself with a fun job, a fun sport, a fun UROP, several fun clubs, and fun trips with my friends to various places so I can experience Boston a bit more before I get hosed. And ironically, I was hosed. It’s not that I’ve given up on trying in my classes— I still do. I leave enough time for myself to finish my PSETs on time and study for my exams. Knowing I need to do something yet being unable to do it is like watching the battery drain from all my devices, knowing I should charge them, yet unable to reach two feet over to my backpack and plug it into the wall. And so it drops from 30% to 20% to 10%, 5%, 2% and when the x starts flashing on the corner of my computer, I can’t do anything. —time skip— I started writing this blog about a month ago, and I guess some things have changed? Well more specifically, I think I get stressed in a different way. It’s less like the primal panic I used to experience and more of a logical “oh no, the consequences of my actions” type of fear. It’s still unpleasant, though mildly better than the former. I’m not sure if this is a problem or not, but I no longer have stress-induced-high-productivity study sessions on command, and now have to rely on catching myself in the right moment to get into the flow or working. I remember the second 8.02 midterm was when this started happening. I was waiting for panic to kick in, but it never did. And about 4 days before the midterm, I started panicking that I was not panicking about the midterm. And so I studied. I felt better the week leading up to the midterm and worse afterwards, but ended up doing way better than I thought I would. I can’t tell if I’m more or less stressed than before, or academically better or worse. There are times when I still can’t do stuff I want to. When I want to work, I have time to work, and I have work to do, but my brain will not let me. It’s not even just schoolwork. I’ve told myself I wanted to CAD something for a long while now. And again, I Yet every time I go to MITERS, or Metropolis, or Radio Society, or anything even remotely related to Course 2, I remember “I should start actually using the app. I should ”. And then I don’t. I stare at the Solidworks logo for a couple seconds and then go back to what I was doing before. I find myself annoying. —time skip— I’ve somewhat come to terms with the fact that there are periods of time where working is not an option.  I understand that, but I still inevitably . I swap between writing essays, doing learning sequences, working on psets, and replying to emails to try and find something I’m motivated to do at the moment. But half the time I give up and take a nap in frustration or waste time for 20 minutes or so. The other half of the time, I work, but at a painfully slow pace. Getting through only one question makes me feel about as awful as not doing anything all. I’m starting to understand what people meant by “being productive with the time you waste.” Funnily enough, when I do feel like do feel like doing work, I’ve been way more productive. 3 to 5am 18.02 went smoother than I thought it would. I got distracted less and was able to work through problems I got stuck on faster than before. But I’m scared to continue relying on this spontaneity. What happens if I stop feeling productive? What happens when I get hosed with finals and can no longer just afford to surf on the oscillating waves? What if that motivation to start working never comes? —time skip— It’s apathy. To my horror, as the semester comes to a close, I gradually realize that my decreasing panic is just apathy creeping in through the cracks in my brain. The fun UROP I got is no longer fun. The fun sport I started is also no longer fun. After a few weeks of not going to pistol practice, I tried to start again, and all I remembered when I walked in the room was just the stress I used to feel standing in front of the target. I didn’t end up going into the range. The progress on my personal projects is going at a snails pace, and I’ve barely gotten through half a Youtube tutorial on how to use Solidworks. I’m passing all my classes, but not enough to tank a missed PSET. Although I need around a 37.5 to pass 3.091 I heard that the final exam is really bad every year and no amount of studying is going to help unless you know all the concepts down to the smallest detail. I don’t know what I’m doing. Everything’s still going as normal (this is  ) . I haven’t missed many clubs and still ended up attending the regular Radio Society meeting over Zoom. I’m not sure I want to run for an officer position next year. I love the club, but I asked one of the members, and he said that the meetings are always like this. It feels like signing up to experience unnecessary stress and be yelled at by equally-if-not-more stressed nitpicky grad students. And in a similar process, I run away from my other responsibilities. “I can write that email later” “It’s too much work, I could be doing other things right now” et cetera, et cetera. So maybe I  On the slightly brighter side, I now realized why college is so much more stressful despite feeling like I’m doing less work. There’s no busy work. For every assignment I’m given, I’m using 100% of my three remaining braincells. Scheduling’s a nightmare, and I often can’t find a time to PSET together with other people, much less study for quizzes and tests. I don’t know how to study. I start working 4 days before a test and get a crap score. A upperclassman speed crams for 4 hours before the same test and gets twice my grade. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, but I’m doing   wrong. In some of my classes, I know enough to know I’m confused, but not enough to know   I’m confused about. Everything’s on fire. Now what? After today, there will be exactly two weeks left until the end of the semester, and I really need to start getting my shit together. As I come face to face with the impending and inevitable doom that is finals, hopefully the clock smacks me hard enough to make me do something. —time skip— #IHTFP

Ahoy there! It’s been a
 
minute. ⁠ 01 more precisely: 6 years, 4 months, and 21 days 
3 years ⁠ 02 cha boi was hired as a sophomore blogger, not as a freshman! in case i get a new avatar, i’m preserving this image of a CHILD by embedding it here On June 5th, 2016, I left behind most of my remaining earthly possessions and hopped in my friend’s car to head back to the West Coast. We stayed in small-town hotels, accidentally drove through Canada, listened to a lot of
 
musicals, ⁠ 03 we had seen Dear Evan Hansen off-broadway together a couple months prior, so I have a very distinct memory of us trying to find and/or recreate snippets of songs that were earworms but not yet an official cast album As we drove away, I felt closure around what I was mentally calling “the Boston Chapter” of my life. This city was where I learned how to advocate for myself and form a community of care. It’s where I cried a lot and made plenty of mistakes that are just a part of growing up. And it’s somewhere that I thought I would visit every once in a while—you know, to catch up with the people I hold dear, after some time and distance away. Here are some things that were true about me then and remain true now: 
Costco ⁠ 04 the Kirkland Signature brand is named for Kirkland, WA, where I grew up ⁠ 05 a comic written by Marjorie Liu, whose <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/on-comics-and-role-models/">class I took,</a> and to whom I am infinitely grateful  I did and then hated the sensation 
oversharing ⁠ 06 with some boundaries! there have always been and will continue to be boundaries! But on July 27th, 2021, I packed up a U-Haul trailer with all of my remaining earthly possessions and hopped in my car, with my partner, to head back to the East Coast so she could begin
 
grad school. ⁠ 07 in library and information science, which is not offered at MIT Here are some things that are true about me now and weren’t when I last lived in Boston: 
I am engaged ⁠ 08 one-way ticket to wife city, baybee

I think I’ve escaped that in-betweenness of young adulthood and swapped it for a different kind of yearning that I
 
don’t have a name for yet. ⁠ 10 I don't think it's a mid-life crisis but maybe it is because I <em>am</em> getting older!?? Framing this chapter as “Boston, again” or “Boston, but different” initially made sense, as I settled into an apartment in a part of the city that I had never been to before, and found new haunts instead of just revisiting old ones. But now I think it’s more like “Building A Home”—something where the place isn’t the anchor of my narrative, as it has been for so much of my life thus far, because I can finally be that anchor for myself. I’m grateful to have been welcomed back to the northeast, to the MIT community, and to new professional adventures with such enthusiasm and kindness. I don’t have a super concrete sense of what I’m going to accomplish at MIT this time around, since there’s no 4-year path and I
 
probably won’t get a degree ⁠ 11 this is me telling myself, once again, that I <em>do not need</em> a master's degree in CMS, as tempting as it sounds But I know I’ll try to do some good things with good people, which the Admissions office is overflowing with, and there will be plenty of surprises along the way.

the department in charge of student groups,  sole The Student Organizations, Leadership and Engagement Office provides an environment for students to test new ideas, develop leadership skills and create community at MIT. and i,,, what? leadership skills? i’ve worn many hats with the student groups i’ve worked with, and i wouldn’t call the things i learned leadership skills. i learned things like: runs on email when2meet whenisgood whenufree doodle bikeshedding these are all things i associate with  , not the nebulous idea of  . you might say: oh, but leaders   others to do things. but managers do so too! a good manager recognizes that if they want things to keep getting done, they need to know the people in their team, and know how to motivate them to do things. this includes inspiring them, helping them grow, unlocking their potential, whatever buzzword. you might say: managers manage tasks, leaders lead people. this is too reductive! if you’re dealing with tasks, you have to involve people, and get to know them and understand them and not burn them out. if you’re leading people, you have to know what tasks they’re doing, and how they’ll fit into the bigger picture, because that motivates people. whatever title: manager, project lead, president, director, chair, head, idk, does it matter? think about a team of three people, sharing manage-y responsibilities between them. i think what matters more is that a team shares the goal of making sure things get done, and once that goal is there the manage-y things will happen.

I’m typing this at around 1 PM on a Friday. My head hurts, just a little. It’s pervaded by the soft buzzing that follows too many days of too little sleep. I haven’t eaten since yesterday evening, and I’ve sort of arrived at the level of hunger where your sides begin to tingle as if they’re being held taut under tension. Emotionally, I feel as if I’m caught at the bottom of a sigh, when you can feel some structure in your chest actively hurting, dripping with that bittersweet feeling of disappointment. Now, I should go rectify all of these things… or at least the first two. I’m not entirely sure how to go about tackling the last one. The motivation to write, though, is a precious commodity, and I’d like not to squander it, now that it’s hit.  Why am I disappointed? As is often the case, I’m disappointed in myself. It’s a familiar feeling. That sensation when you recognize that you’re stuck. Today is one of  those  days, when I have far too much work and far too little desire to do it. I put on the largest shirt I could find because I didn’t want to be aware of my corporeal form. I can’t hear very well, for some reason, and I feel like the physical embodiment of burnout. I feel stupid, unmotivated, inarticulate, ugly, and exhausted. I have worked dozens of hours this week, and all I’d really like is a nap. On days like these, I often fall into the trap of comparing myself to high school Shorna. It’s a very strange relationship I have with her; I’m honestly mildly jealous. I feel like this past instantiation of myself was just… better. High school Shorna knew what she wanted. She didn’t struggle with emotional compartmentalization. She had the capacity to work 13 hours a day, day in, day out. She was passionate about school. She had unending enthusiasm for learning. There were things that she loved. I feel damaged, now. That same jadedness that I was convinced I could evade has settled deeply into the cracks of my psyche. Everything just sort of… aches. Where does it hurt? Primarily, I think I’ve lost my sense of conviction. I don’t consider myself particularly brilliant, but I’ve always thought of myself as exceedingly driven. High school Shorna was ambitious, motivated, and steadfast. Since 7th grade, I had always known exactly what I wanted. I was going to go to MIT, even if it killed me. I was going to live in 3E in Next house, study computational biology and work at the Broad. And, I mean… there was a lot more to it than that. I was going to live in Boston after school, get an MD-PhD at Harvard, be married by 25, have a golden retriever, and live in a blue townhouse, with sunflowers in the windows.  Which is  ridiculous.  At this point, I’m not even sure if these are the things I  want  anymore, much less things I can have. As it turns out, it is very hard to do many of these things, and I worry that I might’ve lost myself somewhere along the way. I’m less convinced of almost everything now – who am I? What do I care about? What do I want out of my future? What is going to make me happy? Frustratingly, a shocking proportion of my end-of-year identity crisis has been prompted by my classes. I’m in 4 classes this semester, and it’s been miserable. I decided to take
 
6.004 ⁠ 01 Computational Structures 
6.009 ⁠ 02 Intro to Programming 
6.008 ⁠ 03 Inference like  coding, and no matter how much I want to be motivated in my classes, I find it hard to care sometimes.  I’m envious of high school Shorna’s clarity. My college essays were, by and large, love letters to biology. I waxed eloquent, detailing all of the reasons that my heart lay with the study of life, and then I decided to become a computer science major. I’m in this perpetual three-way tug-of-war between math, computer science, and biology, now. Interest isn’t difficult to have, but passion? I know what that feels like, and it’s not something I can manufacture. Not for inference, not for computer architecture, and not for anything else.  To be quite honest, part of me was fighting a desire to study biology for a while. Some of this stems from living in Next House. I  love  Next. 3E is a place where I’ve found people I adore and a close-knit community. In between the foam-leaking plushies and the mouse-infested cabinets, I made a home for myself. But Next is so  hard,  and I often feel so out-of-place, here. When I settled down my freshman fall, I was struck by how utterly alien the landscape was. People slung around words like ‘utility’ and ‘nonzero’ and ‘nonintersecting’ with nonchalance; everyone spoke a different language than I did. Math camps and computing olympiads had drawn people together in ways that seemed totally out of reach.
 I walked onto campus without any friends from home ⁠ 04 PLEASE read Ella's excellent blog about this I had never written a proof before my freshman spring, and it’s easy to feel outright inept compared to the kids who take
 
18.701 ⁠ 05 Algebra 1 This is another point at which the comparison with past Shorna sets in. In high school, people were  scared  of me. I’ll sometimes relay this fact to my close friends at MIT, and it’s a foolproof way to garner a few giggles. My persona here is so different. On some level, I’ve been able to free myself from the mirage of ‘smart brown kid’ which used to be my defining personality trait. I’m an assertive, extroverted, outspoken, vivacious person. I think many of my high school friends might’ve called me reserved and calm. But there was no doubt that I used to command respect. I find it harder to be quite so self-assured, nowadays. I often end up being the butt of various jokes about my age (I skipped a grade and hang out with a lot of upperclassmen), height (I’m 5’ 3”… which isn’t actually particularly short), and hometown (Bentonville, Arkansas really has that Hallmark Movie ring). These quips are usually good-natured and well-meant, but it can be tiring after a long day, and I sometimes wonder if my friends only keep me around because I’m an entertaining communal punching bag.  Biology felt like it contributed to those insecurities. Math was a path to glory and respect. Biology was easier, less confusing, more natural, and softer. Doing biology felt like a cop-out, a statement as to the fact that I wasn’t “quite sharp enough” to be good at competitive math. I took
 
18.100B ⁠ 06 Real Analysis 
6.006 ⁠ 07 Intro to Algorithms In fact, some of the intellectual experiences that I enjoyed  most  while at MIT have been things that happened in passing. I loved helping my friend with his
 
7.033 ⁠ 08 Evolutionary Biology This isn’t an admission of defeat (no matter how much it feels like it is); I’m going to keep trying to do math and CS, but I’ve realized that, if I’m pursuing genuine enjoyment of my studies, they can’t be my primary route forward. I concluded that
 
6-3 ⁠ 09 Computer Science 
7.05 ⁠ 10 Biochemistry 
6-7. ⁠ 11 Computer Science and Molecular Biology expecting  my spring classes to be a teeth-pulling, head-banging experience in which I’m constantly fighting my desire to walk away, which is what I anticipated coming into sophomore fall. I can feel the pressure being relieved. And, no matter how conflicted I feel now, I have faith that I will, eventually, figure it out. My conviction and passion will return, as long as I keep trying.

Have you ever wanted to feel happier and thought,  ? No?
 
Because you should. ⁠ 01 please do not actually attempt at home In any case, I spent all semester thinking about laser-powered dopamine production, and now you too! can think about laser-powered happiness! after watching my 3-minute research talk! https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/UAR_talk_final.mp4 This is also probably the most terrifying 3 minutes of my life to date and I have not been able to bring myself to watch it  now I will do it in-person this week! Last spring, I started talking to a postdoc (Binbin) at MIT’s ice rink, partially because I had given up on trying to dodge his small children for long enough to practice jumps on a public session and decided to just flop around the ice with them instead, and partially because he also worked vaguely in bioengineering and his research sounded cool. “Let me know if you ever want a job,” he told me, “I’ve been looking for a SuperUROP student anyways.” To which I went  and then we exchanged contact information and I went home and read many papers and filled out the SuperUROP application less than three days before it was due. In August, the EECS office then notified everyone who was accepted, at which point I started work in the Traverso/Langer Lab. Because Binbin is a lovely mentor who possibly also has too much confidence in me, he essentially let me design my own project based off his  work on hydrogels, This also meant that I semi-regularly appeared in the door of my old UROP supervisor’s office to ask questions like  at which point he told me that  biologists casually just buy genes off the internet paperwork you have to fill out when you want to buy someone else’s genes off the internet and add my gene-buying plans to the transfection protocol I was writing to convince my PI that I had some idea of what I was doing. In November, I pitched my entire “buy-genes-off-the-internet, make-transgenic-mice, and laser-them-happier” plan to my PI, who very understandably responded with something along the lines of “yeah, no, this is wildly expensive and definitely a long-term project in a research direction that the lab is not taking right now, which is probably a reasonable thing to say to an undergrad who wants to embark on a very expensive project. At this point, I had two options: I felt very attached to my project (I made him! from scratch! he’s my child!) and so I sent out a bunch of emails that more or less said hello. rehoming a houseplant but instead of a houseplant it’s a superurop student who wants your support. specifically, your mice. please? except possibly with a few more words explaining my circumstances and with my slide deck attached. Three different professors in
 
BCS ⁠ 02 Brain and Cognitive Sciences  want a   SuperUROP student. At this point, she roped in a couple of grad students working in a relevant field onto the email chain, and
 
now I’m working on my current project! ⁠ 03 after doing yet another lab-specific safety training, which puts me at 6 safety trainings this year It’s not entirely the same as my original proposal, but it is considerably more doable and has the potential to re-expand into what I wanted to do in the first place, so I’m very happy about this. I made this poster for Thursday’s showcase: and in the process realized that I don’t like the “safe” option of plain white slides for presentations. It bothers me that professionalism-core exists as an concept. In lecture and in our example slides, plain slides were the default, though they noted that some people are a little bit riskier and make an intentional design statement with their slides. I don’t like the idea that graphic design is unimportant as long as the science is sound, and I wish that spending time learning how to make your slides something other than sans-serif black text on a plain white background was more normalized. For one, color is not a crime; for another, it feels like an unnecessary dictation of what academia should look like and of who belongs in it. Once, in high school, I had a mentor pull me aside to gently tell me I looked too pretty for people to take me seriously. My school had chosen ten or so seniors to act as student mentors in our STEM extracurriculars, and I could not figure out why they kept pushing me into making promotional material instead of mentoring the math team when I had gotten reasonably far into the world of math contests but had zero business experience and hated getting in front of a camera. “I know you’re good at math, and I think this is ridiculous,” he told me, “but look at the girls — the people — who get recognized as ‘good at math’. You don’t fit that stereotype, girl or not. You show up nicely dressed all of the time and with a stray cat in your arms half of the time.” I stopped wearing skirts to class and feeding cats during break after that. I got the message that I was marketable as a model of femininity, but not as an example of competency, because   and   are disjoint events. The default towards blank slides feel like a soft version of the same idea — of the same aversion to “cutesiness” associated with teenaged girls  -ing on Tumblr, of an aversion to unproductive “artsiness” associated with manic pixie dream women in their early twenties. I’m convinced that we, societally, don’t mock young women for liking those aesthetics (or for buying pumpkin spice lattes) because they are inherently wrong to enjoy; rather, they’re things we mock because they are associated with young women. From an aesthetic standpoint, I don’t want to make my slides pastel pink and full of hand-drawn chibi mice, but at the same time, I almost want to do so out of pure spite. Dolores Umbridge should be allowed to be a scientist without being judged for her aesthetic, you know? For the most part, though, I’m glad that I’ve met a really diverse group of people in UAR presenting a wide range of research topics with an equally wide range of presentation styles, even if blank-white-sans-serif continues to be a safe default option that includes most of the example slides we’re given. My recitation leader and TA have always given relevant feedback on my presentations as a whole, and I like that 6.UAR still supports “riskier” design choices though we don’t really learn much about
 
where to start with visual design.  ⁠ 04 or about the accessibility of our presentation materials -- I've been using https://www.whocanuse.com/ to check my color schemes, but I discovered that in my last CI-M Back in high school, I started thinking of myself as overly loud and annoyingly assertive, because I   overly loud and abnormally assertive for the environment I was in — and then I came to MIT and spent a solid month of my first UROP feeling like I couldn’t take a lunch break because then I would be perceived as lazy and not worthy of being there. That wasn’t actually true — and my then-supervisor was horrified when I mentioned it — but I was convinced it was, and I’m still pleasantly surprised every time my mentors genuinely want the best for me and tell me to put myself first. #6.uar #research is weird sometimes

Woot woot! Simmons is now 20 years old! To celebrate this joyous event, here are 20 things that I’m grateful for in my dorm. 1. I live there Can’t say I’m not grateful for that. Moving on… 2. The bathrooms My entire dorm research process summed up in two sentences: I then started my first year at MIT thinking that

Chalk art Although we can’t paint on the walls, we can use chalk to create ephemeral artworks throughout the hallways. Here are some gems from the 6th floor: Previous Next I even drew a giant pigeon mural in my room! 5. The windows They say that Simmons residents have more windows than friends, but my windows – all nine of them this year – are my friends. Opening their curtains every morning fills me with a sense of accomplishment that words cannot describe. 6. Modular furniture Each piece of Simmons furniture is designed to fit perfectly with the others, allowing us to create countless different room layouts. My friends have spent hours playing around with arrangements to maximize free space. Previous Next 7. The terraces The epic views and cold winter air are just what I need when I take a break from my
 
6.046 ⁠ 02 Design and analysis of algorithms This is an old image I just found online but you get the idea 8. The 4AB lounge Having a lounge space to hang out with friends is integral to my Simmons social life. I like how I could live on a different floor – or even a different dorm – and still go to the lounge and fit in. 9.
 
🅰️levator ⁠ 03 We have three elevators because Simmons has three 'towers' that are disjoint from the 8th to 10th floors, as well as a few other floors This is a controversial opinion among Simmons residents, but we all know that 🅰️levator is far superior to 🅱️elevator and Celevator. Celevator is so lame that it doesn’t even get an emoji. I was a 🅱️elevator 🅱️itch last year until it broke down for a whole week, and I had to climb up 10 flights of stairs every day. Meanwhile, 🅰️levator never breaks down and is always there for you when you need it. (The one downside to 🅰️levator is that we’re not allowed to get out of it on the first floor.) 10. The basement (and MPR) Even though 🅰️levator doesn’t go directly to the first floor, it does lead to the basement and multi-purpose room (MPR), which then lead to the first floor via stairs. It’s like having a personal highway from my room to the front door! Bonus speed from doing this route with rollerblades. The MPR is the only air-conditioned room in Simmons – a great place to be at the start of the fall semester. It also has seats that form a smiley face when viewed from below: 11. Its… unique architecture A perk of living in such a funky-looking dorm is that I can always find my way back to it by looking at the skyline. 12. The parkour wall A consequence of Simmons’ architecture is a special curvy wall on the 7th floor that curves at just the right angle and allows me to defy gravity. https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/VID-20211014-WA0010.mp4 13. The Simmons DB It’s old and written in PHP and crashes more often than I’d like to admit, but it still gets the job done. All efforts to replace it thus far have been thwarted – a testament to its power. Now with email notifications! (Thanks, Jordan ‘23.) 14. Simdin Hot take – I like eating dining hall food. Shoutout to Kem for always making the best omelettes and Thupten for running the stir-fry station like a pro. 15. My
 
GRAs ⁠ 04 Graduate resident advisor This isn’t unique to Simmons, but that doesn’t stop me from being grateful for them anyway. Shoutout to Hope and Elizabeth for all the study breaks and free food! Popcorn study break this week, featuring 6th-floor GRA Thomas. 16. Rubber ducks They’re not pigeons, but they’re still cute. And they’re everywhere. Everywhere. 17. House meetings It’s a great way to interact with the house government and vote on ad-hoc events to allocate house funds toward. The meme raffle at the end is also quite fun, although I am yet to win anything from it. 18. That one scene in Black Panther 2 where Shuri walked through a blank hallway and everyone watching in
 
26-100 ⁠ 05 The big lecture hall where LSC screens movies Truly a monument of modern cinema. (My friends strong-armed me into including something about the film in this post.) 19.
 
Gymmons ⁠ 06 Simmons + gym = gymmons It’s always nice to have facilities easily accessible in my living space, especially when it’s snowing or raining outside. 20. The 4AB lounge again The 4AB lounge is not just a physical space – it’s also a “social lounge” on the Simmons DB. As a result, we get $30 per member per semester to spend on whatever we want – all funded by Simmons house funds, of course. #Simmons Hall

Before college, I was by no means a hardcore Beatles fan. When I was a kid, my dad would play me a few of the classics— —but I didn’t consider myself well-versed in the Beatles discography whatsoever. When I got to MIT, my music taste evolved to include psychedelic rock, and I started encountering more Beatles cuts, but I still wasn’t interested in them enough to take an entire class on them. In May, I watched  MIT: Regressions 
HASS-A ⁠ 01 the art requirement of the eight humanities, arts, social sciences classes students must take The class is so enjoyable. There are two sessions a week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. Every Thursday, the professor talks about an album, gives historical context for it, and explains the musical influences behind the songs. On Tuesday, students present on a randomly selected song from the album in groups of two or three. The presentations are super chill; we mostly just analyze the instrumentation and main musical moments and talk about the story behind the song. All in all, the homework for this class each week consists of listening to an album, writing a brief (<200 word) response on it, reading a few chapters from the book   by Hunter Davies, and preparing for a presentation on a song. It’s super relaxed and fun! Although there’s technically a prerequisite for this class—21M.301 – Harmony and Counterpoint—I enrolled without taking it. My classmates have a much better grounding in music theory than me, which was initially difficult since I’d have very little to say about keys and chord progressions. Over time, though, I gained a lot of nuance and became able to participate just as much as my more musically-trained peers. The class started with the Beatles’ very first album,  , which is most famous for “Twist and Shout” and “Love Me Do.” I only knew the most popular songs on it, so it was interesting to listen to the album with fresh ears while learning about the music that influenced it: skiffle, blues, country, Latin, folk, and more. I also loved learning about the group’s musical inspirations, like Chuck Berry and Lonnie Donegan, and picking out traces of their music in the Beatles’ earlier albums. With this, I was able to gain a new understanding and appreciation for the music I’d been hearing since I was a kid. My favorite section of the class started a few weeks in, with the introduction of the album  . I knew this album for “Norwegian Wood” (thanks to a strange obsession with Haruki Murakami in high school) and saw it as the album where the Beatles’ sound grew closer to the music that I currently listen to and appreciate most. I was thrilled to learn what had shaped this new sound and how the group’s creation process was evolving. Things only got better in the next week with the discussion of  , the album that transformed rock and roll (and also my favorite). Hallucinogen-inspired and conceptually brilliant, this album pioneered a myriad of experimental studio effects. For example, in the song “Tomorrow Never Knows,” a psychedelic classic, John Lennon’s eerie voice was created by placing a  revolving speaker inside an organ—something that had never been done before, let alone considered. Hearing about all the technological intricacies of the album’s creation was beyond fascinating.   Then came  , known for “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.” While I knew this album was critically acclaimed, I didn’t know anything about its creation or status as a concept album, which turned out to be because the titular band is the Beatles’ alter-ego band, with Sgt. Pepper being Paul McCartney. Things only got weirder with our weekly presentations; I fought tooth and nail for the song “A Day in the Life,” which has been my favorite Beatles song since freshman year, and my kind classmates switched around their groups so I’d be able to get it! My team’s analysis ended up being seven pages…we went kind of hard since there’s so much to say about the song. There’s the reason it was banned in several countries—the decidedly non-sexual lyric “I’d love to turn you on,” which refers to Timothy Leary’s famous counterculture-era phrase about using psychedelics to evoke higher consciousness. There’s also the cacophonous orchestral swoop that connects John Lennon’s and Paul McCartney’s sections of the song, which was created by a group of 40 musicians  randomly ascending from the lowest note on their respective instruments to the highest note closest to E major. Crazy! Inspired by everything I’d encountered on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, I chose my final project topic to be about the Beatles’ relationship with psychedelia. In my paper, I broke down what constitutes the “psychedelic sound” and discussed the group’s impact on counterculture. Over Thanksgiving break, I was engrossed in reading the seven (!!) books I checked out from the MIT Libraries, and learned a lot about the Beatles’ contributions to psychedelic rock and place in the fabric of the 60s counterculture movement. I broke down every one of their psychedelic tracks (there are 20+) and ended up writing six more pages than what was required. That’s what happens when you’re   passionate about your final project, I guess. Looking back, I wish I’d been able to take more HASS classes like this one. I’ve never been so motivated to learn so much about a topic, or tackled my final project in as little time as I did with this. I finished my Chinese minor this semester and definitely don’t regret pursuing it, but since my HASS requirements were being filled by language classes, I missed out on opportunities to take more whimsical classes like this. It was so sick to be able to take a class where I learn a ton of lore about a topic I love. I also learned a lot about music theory and now feel that I’m able to listen to music with more trained ears. It helped a lot to have an open format for the class and a professor who’s willing to engage any contributions to the discussion, be they musical or cultural. I had such a great time and would highly recommend this HASS-A!

I didn’t know what to write this week, so I made GPT-3 do it for me. If you haven’t heard of  GPT-3 For example, this is the prompt I gave GPT-3. This is a great idea for a blog post. Unfortunately, I’m in the mood to post about very useless information that is applicable to nobody in the real world. The topic for the rest of this post and the points listed underneath are all written by GPT-3. I just drew the pictures.  You will have a much better graduation photo if you pose with a mane and tail!  All the other college kids will be envious of your majestic beauty and cool style.  You can attend all the classes without having to worry about what to wear.  Grazing and rolling in the grass is an effective stress-relief technique.  You will never have to be late for anything again — you can just trot quickly to your destination!  School cafeterias now offer a variety of hay options to accommodate your dietary needs.  You can finally become an expert on hoof care, from proper cleaning and trimming to nice horseshoe application.

Gandalf’s mark on Bilbo’s door Some friends and I were sitting on the floor of MG’s room. I was browsing email in search of free food when I came across Splash, a program put on by
 
ESP ⁠ 01 Educational Studies Program on and on .  MG decided to teach Intro to Climate Modelling, and another friend, Selena, started designing a show-and-tell style fashion class. Drawn in by peer pressure, I began to ideate. I considered teaching “how to make ______” (fork jewelry? Aluminum flowers? Wire trees?) but quickly discarded it after realizing I did not want to source tools and materials. I do, however, know a bit about writing, and came up with the novel idea of “How to Structure a Novel.” I protested something along the lines of “teaching is hard! The last time I taught someone anything was showing my sister a derivative calculation via snapchat.” Luke Skywalker leaving Tattooine, Frodo Baggins leaving Hobbiton, Harry Potter entering Diagon Alley. I would have descended into the world of Splash if I had shown up for the teacher training, but I, ah, skivved the tl;dr from a friend instead. Galahad in Castle Anthrax Also known as rising action. ‘Temptations’ is a bit outdated, but think Galahad in Temple Anthrax.  I’d recently brushed up on powerpoint skills during Energy Hack, and I cobbled together a powerpoint the night before our classes, which were set for 9am on Sunday. I realized while doing so that I wasn’t entirely sure what kids were reading these days. YA has never been my primary genre. However, the YA series that were big in
 
my day ⁠ 02 <i>Divergent</i>, <i>Hunger Games</i>, <i>Mortal Instruments</i>  were probably well known enough to teach, if I remembered them. I mentally ran through their main plot points, just in case, but decided to mostly stick with the classics. MG and I arose at the crack of 7:45 and trudged the long cold route to the Bush room, where we got hot coffee and bagel sandwiches and went to find our classroom. We would sit in on each other’s lectures, mostly for the formality of having two adults in the room, but I was also looking forward to learning more about climate modelling.  High school students must feel more fear than I do because they were generally not late. They also didn’t make use of MIT time as readily as we college students do. They filtered in — thirty, the max class size I’d allowed. also known as THE ABYSS: DEATH AND REBIRTH There was nothing for it, so I downed my coffee and started teaching. I must have sounded nervous as I introduced myself. I then asked all the kids to introduce themselves, which proved absolutely useless because I only remembered one name, and that because it was the same as one of my friends’. I ran through the Hero’s Journey, as theorized by Campbell and distilled by several later thinkers. The tl;dr is that every story follows one
 
core outline, ⁠ 03 this has become slightly self-fulfilling, as creators write to the outline in the hopes of making their story stronger, and I wouldn’t be surprised if media outlets prioritize stories that follow a set of guidelines Personally, I don’t use archetypal structures of this sort while writing plot outlines, but I think they can be useful for analyzing novels and finding weak points during revision. Star Wars: A New Hope is a perfect example to illustrate the Hero’s Journey, since Lucas based the plot on Campbell’s
 
model ⁠ 04 if you disagree on this, comment! My take is that the abyss = the climax, which comes at the end rather than the middle as shown in the circular model Then I told the class to break into groups and match other novels to the Hero’s Journey structure. As soon as I gave them free rein, the class took off. The room bubbled with far more energy than any 9am MIT class I’ve
 
witnessed. ⁠ 05 so many. MechE core classes are so cruel 
MG. ⁠ 06 Hi Amber! Half a dozen hands went up. “How do you make dialogue seem natural, not canned?” “Do you have advice on building magic systems?” “What if I want to integrate a theme with the plot?” “How do you keep motivation?” “How do you worldbuild without info-dumping?” After I answered those, there were more, and more. These kids had spent time writing. I answered as best I could. “Dialogue? Practice, mostly. ‘Said’ is a good tag. Read a lot, map how they pace out conversations.” “Yes — have you heard of Brandon Sanderson’s  hard and soft magic systems “Hm, try basing all the challenges around the central theme. If the main character is struggling with trusting people, have the rising action create scenarios where they have to trust someone to carry out a task.” “Motivation? Bro I wish I knew. I try to base it on wordcount, outside of school; 1k words a day is a success.” “Sorta weave in worldbuilding as your protagonist moves through the world. If there’s an empire, how do they feel about it? How does it affect their daily life? If there’s a rebellion, how does the protagonist see the pain points of this regime that spawned a rebellion?” Et cetera. I loved their enthusiasm. Some were taking copious notes. Others asked question after question. I was pleased with how much I could answer, if not from my own experience then from the
 
books, ⁠ 07 namely <em>On Writing</em> by Stephen King 
podcasts ⁠ 08 mostly <em>Writing Excuses</em> by Brandon Sanderson & co The most common question was unfortunately the one I was worst at answering. Over and over: how do you stay motivated? What do you do when writer’s block strikes? I went back to my wordcount methods, which worked for most of my life but were kind of difficult in Denmark this summer. A few other students suggested their methods — writing fanfiction of side characters in your own story, to get excited about the world again, or taking a break and jumping to something else. I quoted Brandon Sanderson’s dogma of steady progress, and V. E. Schwab’s method of always working on an early draft of one project and a final draft of another at the same time, thus keeping alive both the creativity of a new draft and the satisfaction of a well-pruned final. We ran out of questions just in MIT-time, at 9:55, and I sent the class on their way. I can no longer say I haven’t taught a class before!  Maybe I’ll approach my Harvard workshop revisions with fresh eyes. I wandered out of the Splash classrooms and to Hayden, where I started a dreary dynamics pset, caught once again in the rush of MIT. Teaching a class for the first time turned out to be more fun than I expected. I plan to develop a more complex lesson plan next time around, whether the lesson is another aspect of writing, a deep dive into some niche part of
 
history,  ⁠ 09 queer emperors? Celtic folklore in an hour?

Pre-registration has opened up, my dear children, and that means it is my favorite time of the year! I love registering for classes because there are   and I’m having difficulty choosing what to do. I am three (3) classes away from graduating. I need to take  ⁠ 01 Communication Intensive class in my major. , and  ⁠ 02 Restricted Elective in Science and Technology. Just an elective basically. I know for sure I am taking
 
6.UAT ⁠ 03 Oral Communication 
CMS.614 ⁠ 04 Critical Internet Studies I want to take approximately   this semester, with 21 (12 from 614 and 9 from UAT) of those already allocated, so that gives me about 33 units to play with. I have a list of classes I’ve compiled that I have some interest in taking and  , dear reader, are going to help me choose. Huzzah! This is an exercise in what it’s like to be a college student having to choose your classes. I’ll talk more about considerations to keep in mind as you choose. Introduction to organic chemistry. Development of basic principles to understand the structure and reactivity of organic molecules. Emphasis on substitution and elimination reactions and chemistry of the carbonyl group. Introduction to the chemistry of aromatic compounds. Okay before you judge me I just think chemistry is interesting but maybe it’s not worth crying over this class. I don’t know. I took organic chemistry in high school and I thought it was really cool (albeit really hard and I think it was my only B in high school which made me cry a lot). : Well…it’s organic chemistry. It’s hard as fuck. It’s not necessary that I take this class at all. This means I’d also have to take a Friday class. Also it meets every day which is a lot wtf. Focuses on developing technical skills to work with big data to expose societal issues and communicate the insights. Working with an external partner (e.g., city government, NGO, academic researcher, media outlet, community organization), students frame important issues that can be mediated or communicated by interactive visualizations. Students then work with real-world datasets, provided by the partner, to implement their own interactive web-based data visualizations (using Vega-Lite, JavaScript, CSS and D3) designed to have a positive civic impact in that domain. Provides exposure to both the messiness and imperfection of real-world data as well as key issues of ethics and inequality that may arise in working with it. Relevant to what I want to learn. It’s a new class which tends to be a lot more flexible/understanding. I’ve always wanted to try data viz. Interacts with society and is real and applicable. : Literally conflicts with every other fucking cool class ever because it meets so OFTEN and it’s really irritating… Implementation and evaluation of intelligent multi-modal user interfaces, taught from a combination of hands-on exercises and papers from the original literature. Topics include basic technologies for handling speech, vision, pen-based interaction, and other modalities, as well as various techniques for combining modalities. Substantial readings and a term project, where students build a program that illustrates one or more of the themes of the course.  Cool class that fits in my interests. Conflicts with other classes. Don’t know if I really am smart enough to take this class? Has a group final project and I hate group final projects. Intuition-based introduction to electronics, electronic components and test equipment such as oscilloscopes, meters (voltage, resistance inductance, capacitance, etc.), and signal generators. Emphasizes individual instruction and development of skills, such as soldering, assembly, and troubleshooting. Students design, build, and keep a small electronics project to put their new knowledge into practice. Intended for students with little or no previous background in electronics. Enrollment may be limited.  Only meets once a week, 6 units so it’s a low time commitment. It would be a good introduction to electronic component things, hopefully low(er) effort. I don’t really know how much I would gain from this class. I already took an electronic projects class, but also I’m not sure how much I retained. This also is not relevant to my studies and seems like an ‘easier’ option compared to my other Course 6 options I’m looking at. Introduces the experimental concepts and methods of molecular biology. Covers basic principles of experimental design and data analysis, with an emphasis on the acquisition of practical laboratory experience. Satisfies 6 units of Institute Laboratory credit. Satisfies biology laboratory credit for pre-health professions. Enrollment limited.  I think biology is cool. It’s only 6 units. It’s a lab class and I have previous bio lab experience but from high school so it’s been a while. Not really relevant to any interest of mine. Also means I have to have a class on Friday which sucks. To gain a deeper understanding of rap, students engage in the full process of creating rap music, including composing lyrics, recording, performing and creating an EP length album. Existing rap music is studied, selected lyrics are analyzed and possible reasons for the structure and success of different songs are presented in case studies. Students will analyze rap songs, reflect on their own weekly activities in writing and present their work in class by playing recordings, performing and responding to each other in workshop discussions. Brief notes: This is NOT a class about hip hop culture but specifically about Rap as an artistic practice and about a practical engagement with all aspects involved in the creation of rap music and its underlying constraints. This class is taught by  THE Lupe Fiasco It’s a requirement to rap in this class. I cannot rap. I am terrified. That’s so scary. This class considers how the internet and social media alter social life. Seminal theoretical approaches to understand the connection between media and social forces – from Mcluhan to Kittler to Keeling – will be covered, as well as empirical studies – from Noble to Couldry and Mejias to Zuboff. Through these readings we will hone conceptual tools for uncovering ideological constructs embedded in material hardware, interface design, and code. Key critical frameworks used in this class include queer theory, intersectionality, and critical race theory. We will also develop methodological tools for interrogating, disrupting, and harnessing social media to effect social change. These tools will be developed through assignments – from semester-long collaborative interventions to short interpretations of media artifacts (tweets, Tik Tok videos, etc.). Classes will incorporate student contributions into lectures, as well as short group exercises. I never got to take my sociology class before and this is a way to fulfill that and it’s super relevant to my major (media studies and computer science) : Conflicts with   so I’d show up late every day which is probably not good for my grade. It’s at 9am, but even more so, 9am at   which means I’d have to wake up extra early to do the 20 minute commute instead of the normal 5-10 minute commute. This course examines the role of race and gender in the U.S. superhero tradition through comic books, graphic novels, film, and television. How do these modern myths reflect on and challenge racism, policing, and nationalism? What acts of radical imagination become possible in the world of the impossible? How do these fantasies reimagine what it means to be (super)human?Focusing on Black, Latinx, and Indigenous characters and creators, we will read comic books and graphic novels from the Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Modern Ages published by DC, Marvel, Milestone, and Image Comics. Authors will include N.K. Jemisin, Dwayne McDuffie, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Vita Ayala, Gabby Rivera, and Nnedi Okorafor. We will also analyze films such as  Black Panther, Blade, Spawn, Eternals,   Shang-Chi;   Watchmen, Batwoman,  Ms. Marvel. This would be a good class to take in the spring since it would follow my comic book writing class this year. Conflicts with other cool classes. Introduction to theoretical elements of music for students who need preparation in the fundamentals of music theory prior to taking 21M.301. Requires ability to read notation in at least one clef. Covers many of the same topics as 21M.051 but at a faster pace. Coverage includes intervals, triads, major and minor keys, basic musical analysis over a variety of idioms in Western music. Also emphasizes developing the ear, voice, and keyboard skills. Not open to students who have completed 21M.051, 21M.151, 21M.301 or 21M.302. 21M.150 is offered first half of term; 21M.151 is offered second half of term. Limited to 20 per section by lottery. I’ve been looking to get back into music and so this is a really cool way to do so since I haven’t done music theory in a while. It’s also a half term class so it would go away after March 24th (mid semester) passes and I could take a different class. Conflicts with other cool classes. Investigates how technology is used in the analysis, modeling, synthesis and composition of music, and its contribution to the artistic production practice. With an eye towards historical context as well as modern usage, topics include the physics of sound, digital representations of music, the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), analog and digital synthesis techniques, MIDI and sequencing, electronic instrument design, notation software, generative music systems, and computational analysis of music. Weekly assignments focus on both theory and practice, requiring technical proficiency, creative output, and aesthetic consideration. Enrollment limited.  I’ve always wanted to learn music things and this is a cool way to do so. I heard this class is more breadth than depth so I’m not sure how much I would really learn. Analyzes mainstream, popular films produced in the post-WWII 20th century US as cultural texts that shed light on ongoing historical struggles over gender identity and appropriate sexual behaviors. Traces the history of LGBTQ/queer film through the 20th and into the 21st century. Examines the effect of the Hollywood Production Code and censorship of sexual themes and content, and the subsequent subversion of queer cultural production in embedded codes and metaphors. Also considers the significance of these films as artifacts and examples of various aspects of queer theory.  I’ve always wanted to take a WGS class. Queer cinema is interesting and cool. I want to learn more about film analysis. Conflicts with other classes. Examines the social, cultural, political, and economic history of the United States, from the Civil War to the present. Uses secondary analysis and primary documents, such as court cases, personal accounts, photographs, and films, to examine some of the key issues in the shaping of modern America, including industrialization and urbanization, immigration, the rise of a mass consumer society, the emergence of the US as a global power, and the development of civil rights activism and other major social movements. History is cool! And I think US history is cool! Do I really want to write long essays on this? Conflicts with other classes. This course focuses on a critical media sociology of immersive worlds, from the analogue to the digital. Rather than splitting the online and offline, we will explore the complex intersections and flows (of practices and themes) across spaces. Focusing on digital “virtual” environments and avatar-based worlds, as well as theme parks like Disney, we will investigate key issues in immersive worlds including, for example, communication & community, authorship & co-creativity, embodiment & identity, and ownership, governance & management. Woven throughout is an attention to the cultural and socio-technical nature of these environments and their ongoing construction within a broader media system. There are no pre-requisites, but the course will run seminar-style with limited enrollment. I love T.L.! She taught my Games and Culture class and I always find her an interesting lecturer and love the discussions that come from her classes. This class is also new so I anticipate it won’t be too intense. Also, sociology is cool and the subject matter is interesting! Conflicts with so many classes. This class is open to anyone who can write a letter, not an e-mail, a letter, just a plain simple letter, to someone who lives far away from you and who has no idea really of who you really are, except that you are, like them, another human being. I have not quite yet settled on the books we will read but we will see some films: The Four hundred Blows, Black Girl, The Battle of Algiers, The Mack, a documentary about the Motown singing group, The Temptations. I’ve never done a fiction writing class before formally and I think I have a LOT to learn here. I have to  in order to take it. It’s at Harvard so there’s a long-ish commute time. Conflicts with a lot of classes. Intermediate class for students with some experience in writing fiction. Students write short stories and complete other writing exercises. Readings include short story collections by contemporary writers such as Sandra Cisneros, Benjamin Percy, Leila Lalami, Laura Pritchett, Bret Anthony Johnston, and Edward P. Jones. Discussions focus on sources of story material, characterization, setting, architecture, point of view, narrative voice, and concrete detail. More writing experience! I’ve never done a fiction writing class. Time conflict. Also might be too hard for me? I’ve never done fiction writing and so this might be out of my league, who knows? As you can see there are general buckets of classes I want to take: – classes that deal with evaluating media and applying things i’ve learned in my other CMS classes to these new forms – classes that allow me to make or learn music is some fashion or manner – classes that will help me become a better writer – classes that are cool and/or interesting and/or relevant to my degree Before you vote Here is a   of what my schedule would look like with   Keep in mind I really am trying  next semester. So keep that in mind. I also would like to stay  . I’m already taking the  . These are 9 and 12 units respectively, subtracting 21 units from the 54 unit limit I have imposed. This gives you 33 units of room to work with, but to make things easier I’ll give you   to work with. With these constraints: Vote For My Classes Here Form will be open until idk like…January 1st?

november 29th, 2022 10am : you attend nano lecture but are unable to focus on the class because you feel BURNOUT. you think about how you somehow always manage to feel burnt out at this point in the semester, regardless of how many classes or commitments you have 11am:  you decide to try maseeh dining because people on mit confessions have been claiming it’s better than next dining now. you haven’t really visited maseeh dining since freshman year. you feel SURPRISE upon trying the food and realizing that it no longer makes you nauseous and has actually improved significantly 3pm:  you go to a cafe with K, a friend of a friend who asked to hang out. you feel REGRET upon looking at the menu, because you don’t like coffee and there are no other drinks, so you buy a cookie even though you’re not hungry. you feel NERVOUS because K talks very quickly and asks sharp questions, but the conversation is good anyway. towards the end of the chat, K says he’s become a lot more enthusiastic about post-college life over the past year, because he’s met a lot of interesting and thoughtful people such as yourself. you feel FLATTERED upon hearing this 5pm:  you go to an admissions blogger meeting, which primarily consists of a discussion about how to welcome and onboard the incoming class of 2027. you feel EMBARRASSMENT as you realize during the discussion that you actually care a lot more about this school than you did in any previous year, that after three years this place has finally gotten to you and broken down all your shields. you feel HAPPINESS when you look around the room and notice that you no longer feel unwelcome or judged at blogger meetings, and although it took a year you’ve now reached a point where you like (or at least have a positive impression of) everyone in the room 7pm:  you get free food from an ai club event. while in line, one of your friends asks you for advice on how to make time for personal projects during the semester. you tell them about how, last spring, you banned yourself from doing schoolwork between 9am-5pm on tuesdays and thursdays, and how that’s the most effective strategy you’ve tried so far. you feel WISE upon saying this 10pm:  ohms rehearsal begins. you feel STRESS because you are the music director, and a few months into your role you still don’t think you are doing a good job of leading rehearsals. the rehearsal mostly goes fine, although you feel ANNOYED because one of the arrangements is being changed mid-rehearsal, a week before your concert 12am:  rehearsal ends, and you walk back to your room. you read through a text conversation where one of your math professor friends talks about how they’ve been working to improve diversity in math education and access in underprivileged communities. you feel INSPIRED, but soon afterwards you feel SHAME as you question what you are doing with your life – why are you spending so much time reading about ai research and learning about niche startups and recruiting for tech roles when you could be working on problems like education or climate that feel far more valuable? 12:30am:  one of your friends tells you they’ve decided to take a software position at a trading firm after college. you feel DISAPPOINTED upon hearing this – you thought for a while that they were going to start their own startup, which would’ve been much more interesting. you feel LONELY because all your friends at mit are going to grad school or finance or big tech while you’re trying to find another path forward, and everyone tells you that you’re doing great but it’s so fucking hard to know what to do when nobody is doing it with you. you feel LONGING as you think about some of the people you met in your travels and wish you had their perspectives with you right now. you feel FRUSTRATION as you wonder what could have been, how much good could have come about but never will, if young people at this school weren’t just left to their own devices to be swept up by peer pressure and marketing and insecurity, if they actually had the support they needed to make bold and principled and life-affirming decisions. you feel LOST. you feel DEFEATED. you want to cry. 2am:  you think about everything that happened today. you don’t usually feel this many emotions this strongly in a single day. the whiplash from all the starts and stops and changes in direction is both thrilling and crushing. you feel EXHAUSTED. you go to sleep

Here’s my previous video game posts: Incremental games Celeste Slay the Spire Bundle for Palestinian Aid I’m the kind of person who likes playing games that I can play over and over. When I made the Slay the Spire post two years ago, I had 67 hours in the game. Now I have 300 hours. Sometimes I play new games too. I have a huge backlog of games in my Steam library that I’m working through. The trouble is that I play the same games over and over, so I get through games at a slower rate than adding them to my to-play list. Oops! Trimps made my incremental games post You trap these creatures called Trimps, and send them to battle. You colonize more and more of the unfamiliar planet you find yourself in, while trying to discover what caused your  laser-guided amnesia One thing I appreciate about Trimps, moreso than any other incremental game I’ve played, is how well-designed the core mechanics are. Balancing the different resources available isn’t entirely obvious, with several meaningful ways of progressing. Despite that, the game hasn’t felt overwhelming enough to require a guide. (Looking at you,  The Prestige Tree My main gripe is how   it is, especially at the beginning. It always feels like I want more automation, and when a piece of automation does get unlocked, I felt like I should’ve gotten it a few days earlier. This is the main reason I’ve dropped the game.  AutoTrimps This is a   game. You could play for months and not reach the end of it, and new content is still being added. If you get into it, expect to leave it running in the background for days upon end with little intervention. Large community as well. A charming Nintendo RPG for the GBA, Mother 3 has an interesting history. Although it’s never been localized, it has a popular  unofficial translation The most similar game I’ve played to Mother 3 was Undertale, which itself was inspired by the Earthbound trilogy. The charm of Mother 3 comes from its strong writing, which is at times weird and quirky, and other times emotional and heartrending. It deals with themes like grief, community, family, and, uh, capitalism. Don’t be fooled by its graphics: these cute pixels belie a heavy story. I’m a person who likes to  enjoy the story, skip the game This is no fault of Mother 3; this is just how Nintendo RPGs tend to play out. (I remember playing Dragon Quest IX as a kid and finding it hard.) I want to put on the record that I think different people enjoy different things from video games, and it’s up to each player to experience the game the way they want to. Whether it’s grinding, turning on the cheats, or watching a Let’s Play instead; if it doesn’t ruin the fun for others, I say go for it. The game took me around eighteen hours to finish. If I did the grinding, I expect it would’ve taken twenty-four hours. from the  hades steam page Hades is a roguelike. I’ve talked about roguelikes before, and they’re one of my favorite genres.  Slay the Spire The game has deep mechanics and complex controls. There’s move, attack, special, cast, dash, call, summon, and sometimes reload, all different methods of attacking enemies. In a sense, it’s the  opposite of Celeste The environment and enemies in Hades don’t introduce new mechanics (except in one late-game case); the complexity arises from all the possible ways to attack, and needing to juggle between them. It’s very possible to finish the game without using all of these mechanics, but to those who want to challenge themselves, the option’s there. This, I think, distinguishes Hades and Slay the Spire from games like Dicey Dungeons and Loop Hero: the sheer complexity available to the player. One thing about Hades, that I haven’t seen in the other roguelikes I’ve played, is its emphasis on story. Its story is centered on reconciliation and fate. Every mechanic is diegetic, with pages of lore and rich worldbuilding available to those who want it. I’m not a big family person myself, but like Mother 3, I can appreciate a good family story when I see one. So this is one of those rare games I play for both gameplay   story. from the  vampire survivors steam page Vampire Survivors is… another roguelike. In my defense, I mentioned   games that weren’t roguelikes! And it’s unlike Hades in many ways. The story almost feels like an  excuse plot It’s probably most notable for being both absurdly cheap and highly-rated. It’s the second  highest-rated game on Steam It also just got out of early access, and I’m excited to see what else is coming in the game.

This post includes an in-depth and personal discussion of the November Rule. I recommend  these posts  for more reading/information on the Rule itself, though I will also be detailing what the Rule is here. While the audience I am directly talking to is meant to be members of the MIT student body, this post is one that I believe may be useful for high schoolers, prefrosh, and people in general. And in case at any point it feels a bit vague, let me be perfectly clear: do not break the November Rule. But if you do, you aren’t alone.  Incomplete Understanding. More aptly titled: The game of rules and living by them. The Name of the Game Math people stereotypically like rules. They provide formal systems with which to navigate the world. This is unsurprising for a field (again, stereotypically) devoted to axiomatic thinking. Except, in reality, mathematicians don’t start research papers with the axioms they’re assuming. They simply know that the axioms exist, and, at the very least, what those axioms imply for the type of math they are trying to understand. This approach to understanding and navigating the world is one I believe most people try to utilize– not just the mathematicians. From childhood, people are taught (some of) the social and legal rules they should follow. Now, these rules aren’t as rigorous as those in math– they are hardly logically consistent or complete– but we get by as best as we can. This is what makes society and math both extremely different and extremely similar. The difference is apparent through the logical inconsistencies, while the similarities are seen through the  actual  real world applications. Because by the end of the day, all we are trying to do is make some non-trivial addition to our respective worlds, and this requires accepting a (perhaps incomplete) knowledge of the rules so that we can actually sit down and get some actual work done. 2. The Questions at Hand. More aptly titled: Formalism. Song:  Night Shift , by Lucy Dacus Personally, I appreciate the rules of math, even if some of them can be a bit pedantic. This is because I am a formalist. I believe that math is a human-built mechanism designed with a purpose that can be motivated and (hopefully) understood by the people who created it.
 
Other mathematicians, ⁠ 01 cough cough CJ; (CJ: “i'm a platonist on the weekdays and a formalist on the sundays”) out there – that math is a fundamental truth of the universe that humans are merely approximating (platonism). Though, for the purposes of this blogpost, this is neither here nor there. However, when it comes to the rules of society (or subsets thereof), I am often (at best) a bit of a follower. I accept that these rules exist for some reason and move on with my life. But on occasion, I feel rather frustrated by the rules that be. In particular, I wonder who created them, how they are enforced, and why they even exist. Often,
 
societal rules ⁠ 02 like “why shouldn’t I talk really loudly in the deep lounge at 2am” and “why shouldn’t undergraduates be allowed to hang out in this area” are harder to motivate for oneself when there is no  clear  rewarding outcome. It isn’t that these rules aren’t beneficial, it’s rather a question of who they benefit. Because more often than not, this person isn’t  you . At least, not at first. 3. the  ⁠ 03 for clarity, in this post, the word Rule is capitalized when referring to the November Rule in particular, which is most of the time. 
More aptly titled: Don’t Break It. Song:  Back to Black , by Amy Winehouse While the last two sections are generally true, in this post I want to talk about the November Rule specifically. The November Rule states* that first years  should not  get into a relationship, romantic or sexual, before November of their freshman fall. The reason there is an asterisk here is due to the fact that the rule is different depending on who you ask. Some people/places say that the Rule specifically applies to first year/upperclassmen relationships, but I feel like this is insufficient. For the reasons below, I believe that the rule  should  be that that first years should not get into a relationship, romantic or sexual,  regardless  of class year, before November of their freshman fall. That being said, it may be worth noting that there isn’t a universally agreed upon ‘November Rule’. Note that (in this section) I’m not talking about anything inherently original. Some of the reasons for not breaking the Rule have been discussed time and time again in the blogs and in   (see links in the preface). a) Who you know (or moreso, who you don’t). Try listing out the people you knew (or know) as a frosh. How many of them live in the same hall as you? How many are in your classes? Your clubs? From your high school or from your high school activities? If you were to cross off all of the people on your list who fit this criterion, chances are you’re left with an empty sheet of paper. This isn’t a bad thing; it’s to be expected. Most social circles are initially formed like this. You form PSET groups with your classmates and get dinner with people in your hall/in your club, and with how busy MIT is it can be really hard to meet people any other way.  So often, as a first year, you know  no one new  when you get here. Why is this a bad thing? Because if the relationship goes sideways, which no one  wants  to happen, those involved can become/feel deeply isolated. Your social groups are usually more limited your first year. W ho you know is often who is a part of your support system. Thus, the person you get in a relationship with is more likely to become a part of your social circle if they aren’t already a part of that circle. And when this circle is all you know (compared to later years when your friend group is likely more spread out), it’s common for either you or your partner to be ousted from the social group and it can become  hard to turn to the circle for help. Relationships ending can already make you feel alone, and a lack of a support system can only add to that. b) An additional twelve units. There’s a common, and relatively realistic, notion that a relationship is an additional “twelve units” on top of your course load no matter what year you’re in. For MIT, this number is meant to coincide with the number of hours you should expect to spend per week on some class. Of course, some classes are less than that, and others are dastardly more. But whichever the case may be, there is a reason that first years are only allowed to take 54 units (this is a new-ish change, before it used to be 48). A  lot of thought  is put into this credit limit. It is meant to keep first years from inadvertently over-exerting themselves with their first year “I was the best at my high school and I want to be the best here!” energy, as well as give students the chance to explore both the campus and their identity. You might ask why this only applies to first years, and the answer is that quite frankly it doesn’t. There are a number of upperclassmen who take a million classes and do a billion clubs, and I’ve been exploring my identity through these blogs my entire time at MIT. But the more time you spend at MIT, the more you learn how to balance this exploration with your priorities whatever those may be. So what happens when you pile on another twelve units with a relationship as a frosh? However good at balancing you think you might be from high school, hell hath no fury like a full course load at MIT. c) Most general, but thus most likely applicable. Things can go wrong. The best relationships can end, and the best semesters can take a turn for the worst. No one wants this to happen to you. And it isn’t like we are out here thinking it’s more  likely  to happen to you because you’re in your first year. But most everyone has seen how devastating an experience like this can be for one’s freshman fall. So devastating, that many (including myself) truly believe that it is better to be safe than sorry. College is the time to take risks and go out on a limb. But we have seen too many branches break when there is so much to be done here, safer on the ground. 4. Me: My first year. 
More aptly titled: Breaking the Rule. Song:  Motion Sickness , by Phoebe Bridgers My first year started like most first years do. It began with two packed suitcases and a backpack to move from California to a different state to start school. Except, this year was in the middle of the pandemic, and I wasn’t moving to Massachusetts. I was moving to an apartment in New York City with two other first years for the fall. To be honest, I felt like the November Rule held little water. Like, I could see how it had hurt others, but it would be different for me somehow. But then, I broke the November Rule. As quickly as the relationship started
 
it ended. ⁠ 04 Out of courtesy for the other person involved, and for any number of other reasons, this is as much specific detail as I will give into the actual relationship itself, though there may be a second part to this post providing some more context into my side of the relationship. And it has played a role in my MIT experience, for better or for worse, ever since. On paper, that semester went  great . I maintained my stellar GPA of
 
all Ps (passes), ⁠ 05 though if there were any NRs (no records) then that wouldn’t be on paper would it 
biggest city in the world ⁠ 06 well more accurately the United States I had no support system. When the semester started, I was expecting a tight-knit living group of frosh just trying to survive the pandemic. Instead, all I had was weekly PSET Zoom calls with people who had no idea
 
what I was going through ⁠ 07 because I hadn’t told them let alone anyone But on paper I was fine. I kept telling my advisor this. I kept telling my mom this. I kept telling myself this.  Just get through this, and you’ll be fine. And I got through it. As it turns out, it’s not impossible to exist at MIT if all you’re doing is trying to do is  get through  it. Survive, focus on your studies, and nothing more. 5. Me: Three semesters later. 
More aptly titled: In Pursuit. Song:  Run Boy Run – Instrumental , by Woodkid. My sophomore spring, I took 21L.000: Writing about Literature which focused on monsters and monsters in society. In this class, I got to read  Frankenstein  for the second time since high school, and there was one line in particular that struck me differently this time around. Before Victor Frankenstein created the Creature, he told the following about his time in school to Walton: “Two years passed in this manner [deeply engaged in my studies], during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make.” (For context, this is just a bit before he had created the Creature.) When I read this, I saw a part of myself in Victor. Which was quite frankly, unnerving, for obvious reasons. I engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of math. I think I did pretty well in this regard. I took cool classes and I learned some neat things. But I felt like I had no one. Three semesters later, and I was back where I started after breaking the Rule: alone. Sometimes, I wonder where I would be if I hadn’t broken the Rule. Maybe I would have a better support system, and maybe I wouldn’t be so terrified to create one. Maybe I would’ve gone to Ring Premiere and formals and parties with friends, rather than alone if at all. Maybe I’d have more to my name than the pursuit of some discoveries. At the end of the book (spoiler alert), Victor dies. The Creature comes to pick up the body of his Creator, and ends his life in a fiery blaze. Only then does Walton choose to do something more than engage in his own academic pursuit. At the end of my sophomore year, I planned to do the same (as Walton, to be clear). 6. Me: Now. 
More aptly titled: Horcruxes. Song:  Somewhere Only We Know , cover by Darren Criss, written by Keane One reason people advocate for the November Rule is that “first years need to learn how to be independent at MIT”, but I find this to be insufficient. Hell, I have never been as independent as when I had broken the Rule. When people argue along these lines, I believe what they mean is that first years should learn how to strike the balance
 
between dependence and independence. ⁠ 08 or as Ana Sanchez ‘22 puts it: learn how to exert agency. The issue with breaking the November Rule, in my experience, is rather  hyper-independence . After the relationship that led to the breaking of the Rule, I didn’t know how to talk to anyone about what I was going through. So, I didn’t. I just kept it to myself, and as I entered my sophomore year, I started finding it  difficult to lean on others for support.  Asking for help is something that requires so much vulnerability that is often difficult for me to muster. Some of my friends are really good at reaching out when they need help. They’ve created a community of people they can rely on. Part of me wonders if this community is one that is supposed to be fostered during your first year. After all, first years needing help navigating adulthood in college is  expected . It’s  expected  that the upperclassmen on your hall or in your major provide some amount of support to first years. It’s  expected  that by your sophomore year you feel like some fraction of the hellscape that is MIT feels normal. I now know, or at least am learning, that this community is one that can be formed whenever one goddamn pleases– and there are always people who are willing to help. There are always people who  want  to help. Maybe this is what I would’ve learned if I had a normal first year. But I didn’t have a  normal first year In this way New York was like a  horcrux  (Harry Potter reference). If that semester had gone well, who knows where I would be now. But it didn’t. And now it feels like a fraction of my soul has been shattered. I feel like I am a bit less powerful than I could’ve once been. I feel like by breaking the Rule I broke some part of my ability to reach out for help. Like somehow, some way, all the time, it’s my fault. And I know it isn’t. I know that simply blaming myself is reductionist and unrealistic. 
But who else is there to blame? I don’t blame MIT; generations of students have survived the Institute so how can It be at fault? I don’t blame upperclassmen; I hardly even knew any my first year  to  blame (not that I would blame them even if I did). And I especially don’t blame the person who broke the Rule with me; they were a first year too. Why should it be expected that they should’ve known better than I did? But where does that leave me? Feeling utterly and hopelessly alone. 7. Rules, again. 
More aptly titled: An Answer. Song:  The Answer , by Joe Iconis and covered by George Salazar When a rule doesn’t make sense, I question it. I’ve always been someone who asks questions. Who made the November Rule? If I had to guess, someone (likely a collection of someones) who broke this previously nonexistent Rule and paid the price. A person who wished that someone,  anyone , would’ve told them not to. Would they have listened to that someone? Who’s to say. I know I didn’t. But the mere presence of a Rule can provide some amount of comfort to those to have to face the consequences of breaking it. Some amount of comfort in the fact that other people, many people unfortunately, have been where you are. Who enforces the November Rule? In reality, no one. It isn’t against the law for two adults to be engaging in a relationship in their first year of college before November. Now that doesn’t mean that society shouldn’t uphold this Rule in some form or another. If you see upperclassmen “preying” on the new first years, tell them to back the hell off. Tell them the Rule and tell them why it’s important. And if you know a first year who broke the Rule, don’t hold it against them. Ask them if everything’s okay. Is the semester going well? Has balancing a relationship with MIT been hard? Tell them that you’re there for them, and be there for them if they need help. Who benefits from the November Rule? To be frank, I think everyone does in their own, perhaps muddled and unclear, way. If the Rule prevents you from breaking it, great. If it doesn’t, then at least you know you’re not alone.  Others have been where you are. 
I’ve been where you are. This doesn’t mean that the pure existence of the Rule makes the pain go away. It just means that you’re not alone. It means I’m not alone. 8. Tricky. More aptly named: The Caution in Telling a Cautionary Tale. Song:  Being Alive , from Company Writing about the November Rule is tricky. In fact, while I was searching for resources from people who had previously written about the Rule, I came to the conclusion that not many people  have . It isn’t that the Rule is unimportant– it’s basically preached to every first year. But the  nuances  are tricky to deal with for a number of reasons. For one thing, you don’t want people to come to the wrong conclusions. Take for instance this post. Here, I wrote about how, in my sophomore year after breaking the Rule, I was hyper-independent. After having such a bad first year, I found it really hard to lean on others for support– emotionally and academically. This made my sophomore year deeply isolating and frustrating. My  intention  is for this to come off as undesirable. The last thing I want is for someone to read about my experience and come to the conclusion that they should be overly-cautious and avoid deep emotional (platonic) relationships your freshman year. In reality, forming connections during your time at MIT is important. While we are only here for a short amount of time, connections with others can make the MIT experience so much deeper and more fulfilling. This is an  overly In contrast, one could hypothetically reach an  und erly -cautious conclusion. One could come to the conclusion that my experience was a result of the pandemic rather than a result of breaking the November Rule. And while this may be plausible, and while it is interesting to examine the role that the pandemic played during my first year, the  underly -cautious conclusion would be something along the lines of: “Well, Paige only had a bad first year due to the pandemic, breaking the Rule can’t be all that bad  now .” No. Bad. Stop that, hypothetical person reaching an unintended and potentially harmful conclusion. My  intention  is to tell a cautionary tale. My story may not perfectly apply to every person and every scenario, but I hope it provides an example of a painful experience that is rarely talked about. Furthermore, it takes (at least) two to make a relationship. This isn’t just  my  story. I think this writing dilemma is one that has no correct answer most of the time. Sure, if I was in a better place with the person I was in the relationship with, I could ask them, but they don’t want to talk about what happened anymore– and I don’t blame them for that. It’s their prerogative. It just means I can’t exactly  ask  them for permission. But I need to process what happened that year, and I do that best through writing. Is there a way to write about my experiences while being respectful of their privacy and their own side of the story? I sure hope to try.   
But am I allowed to tell it? ⁠ 09 Spoiler: there may be a second part to this post, undecided but very likely. It’s just tricky. I don’t know where precisely to  begin . #math analogies #november rule #relationships

A few weekends back, I went to EnergyHack, ran a half-marathon, and survived! For EnergyHack, I was on a team with my friend Josephine R. ‘24, and her lab mate, Rick W. ‘25, an exchange student from the Netherlands. EnergyHack began Friday night with a few speeches and an unveiling of the challenges. There were about 100 teams, and 10 different challenges set forth by various companies, all heretofore unknown. Then there would be catered dinner. I’d had a midterm and a major essay on Thursday and Friday, so I hadn’t devoted much time to either hack prep or sleep. Still, enticed by the promise of free food, I roused myself and went to the opening event on Friday. Josephine is a chemical engineer, Rick knows computer science, and I am MechE. We were excited and nervous to hear the challenges and get to building. Would we have the chops to make something that worked in 36 hours? Were we expected to sleep during those 36 hours? We listened to the keynotes — one by a startup making smart windows, another by a steel production company. Then came the challenges: The first challenge was to design — or, given our time frame, research — a green alternative material for an established company that was presumably trying to make more climate-friendly choices. The second challenge was to craft an advertising schema for a company which was in the process of re-branding its pre-existing process to sound more green.  The third was to research ways to reduce emissions for a particular company’s refining process. All in all, each challenge was more suited to advertising or market research than building new products. ‘Hm,’ we said, and went to get EnergyHack free dinner.  Josephine and I are generally vultures and consume anything, but this particular food was not our cup of tea, or rather plate of greasy, lukewarm lasagna.  In hindsight, MIT Energy and Climate Club is a business-focused energy club, so we could have seen this coming. In the moment, though, we were floundering to find where our skillset would fit — we knew about thermal processes and machining, but weren’t deeply knowledgeable about most of these fields, and we had 1.5 business and negotiation classes between the three of us.  We went through the list of challenges and narrowed down to which ones seemed to require the most technical knowledge, and the fewest advertising skills. We chose one about finding new data center cooling tech. the bio lab That night, we holed up in Josephine and Rick’s lab, munching on
 
free granola bars ⁠ 01 there is a theme here Washed with so much new information, it was difficult at first to find a way to go, but we were feeling hopeful. I crafted an email to send to our mentor, who had designed the challenge to begin with, laying out our intended direction and asking for any criticism. After finalizing the email, however, I realized we hadn’t actually been given our mentor’s contact info, so we turned the email back to bullet points to show him at our meeting the next day. Previous Next The next day, bright and early at
 
11am, ⁠ 02 Josephine showed up at 9:30 but the rest of us, uh, did not We revised our plan, which was focused on liquid cooling, which was new but had a healthy foothold in the industry. We did a bit more research, then met with our mentor. Our mentor was from a VC company. We laid out our plan for determining which cooling systems to recommend — any questions? “You guys are from MIT,” he
 
said, ⁠ 03 translated from professional lingo. Being from MIT, we have an understanding of how AI works, but none of us were focused on the development of AI, with or without regard to data centers. Still, we said, “You bet,” and scurried back to our table, where we began researching AI. As it turns out, AI has been recently applied to optimize air cooling systems. It’s a good fit, since data centers are full of sensors anyway. A few major companies, including Google, have used AI optimization to reduce energy use by 40% This all looked promising, but there was only one startup we could find that was applying AI to smaller companies, as Google’s work seemed to be internal. We scraped together all the information we could find, recommending the single new startup, and AI as a whole. “This feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Rick said, later that night. “We think he wants us to recommend AI, so we’re recommending AI.”  We paused and took a breath. Did we actually believe in AI? Maybe — it seemed like the best way to make air cooling more efficient. We hadn’t found an AI model for liquid cooling, which is less common, but that didn’t mean the two weren’t compatible.  We did think that liquid cooling was better for new data centers, for the moment, since AI-enhanced air cooling systems were more or less equal to liquid cooling in terms of energy usage. This decided, we set to making a presentation. we holed up in the media lab for the night, which doesn’t have public access free food but does have secret granola bars if you know where to look It was interesting to actually have opinions on this topic, which I’d literally begun researching the night before. I’d planned for Energy Hack to take up all of Saturday, so I devoted myself to the project without worrying about other work I could be doing. I was exhausted. I’d been working on something since the previous Sunday, jumping from pset to midterm to final essay without any days of rest.  Remember the Sabbath,  I told myself;  keep it holy. Reserve the weekend for bacchanalia.  I was thinking about how, at MIT, I rarely have the time to let new obsessions seize me. I’ll watch forging videos over quick meals, but don’t get to start every project that comes to mind. My notes for new stories are just that, notes. I have not been consumed by a book in too long. I miss that. During summer, I spent a week going to krav maga every day, and I felt myself improve by the end. Now I’d feel much more confident writing fight choreography where both characters keep their footing. I also spent a weekend writing a story about a vampire. In the covid spring of ‘21, I read the  Six of Crows  series and could think of nothing else; how long since a book has so gripped me? I am hoping this IAP will give me space to fall into my own hobbies and wonderings. After this, anyway, I know a lot about cooling data centers. media lab, 8pm Saturday afternoon, Rick found an excellent tri-color template. We divvied up the slides, added pictures and captions. Rick edited our slides down to make them effective and to the point. All told, the presentation looked great. We finished around 9pm, and went off to scrounge up food. I went to a party for not terribly long, then went home and fell asleep by 11. It felt unnatural.  I then tossed and turned for a few hours before my alarm rang at an ungodly 6am. I stumbled out of bed, wolfed down some pad thai leftover from a different free food event, and got dressed: leggings, ratty
 
Harvey Mudd ⁠ 04 my college first fly-in! I never applied because I thought tech schools were a lot of work. Go figure. The half-marathon was an idea from this summer, when two of my friends suggested we do it. However, both friends wound up sustaining injuries, so I was the only runner left standing. I hadn’t trained. I took an Uber to the race track through a grey Boston slowly awakening. The park where the course started was full of tents and volunteers in runners in bright colors. Everywhere, new shoes. People were sprinting on the track, or stretching. I scurried past, head down, while a drizzle began to come down. The course went out-and-back through Boston streets, blocked off for three hours for this occasion.  We lined up at the starting line, although it was more of a mass of people, too big to see the front or back. A few rounds of professional runners started before the rest of us, and then, without even a
 
gunshot, ⁠ 05 idk if they do this everywhere but that was the starting sound for high school races in Arizona. Everyone around me was running kinda fast, and I tried to keep up with them. I am no longer competitive but suddenly I cared a lot about keeping up with the group. The only thing is, in a marathon this big and open to a general audience, the makeup of any group of runners is constantly shifting as some move ahead and others fall behind. I wound up choosing one person to stick near. Whenever I passed them or if they ran so far ahead I couldn’t keep track, I found a new person.  This was so helpful in keeping up my pace! I almost always run alone, and I’d forgotten how lovely it is to run in a crowd. Boston has hills! Terrible. A crime. My instinct is still to pass people on the way up hills, which is kinda silly but so so tempting.  Half-marathons are also kind of like being tattooed on the calf, because every thirty minutes a new part of muscle you’d never given thought to before starts hurting like all hell.  There were markers every mile, often with water, gatorade, or gatorate chews. The course program clearly listed which miles would have water and chews, etc, but I read the program in about 5 minutes and didn’t retain much, so each marker had randomized gratification. This is good for  training dogs After a long long time and many miles, I reached what I thought was the finish line and sprinted. It turns out this was not actually the finish line, it was like 400 meters away from the actual finish line, so I kept running and sprinted harder through the actual finish. I completed the marathon in 1 hour 49 minutes!! Race done, I wandered, spent and starry-eyed, through the rainy park. Some volunteers gave me a bag of snacks, which would have been free except I’d paid a race fee, so they were really the most expensive pretzels and hawaiian rolls I’ve ever had. Then I went back to campus, thawed in the shower, and — the most difficult part of my weekend — hobbled on a sore hamstring to campus for the final EnergyHack presentation. We met on Zoom with our mentor, where we gave our recommendations for AI and liquid cooling: AI for established air-cooled data centers, and liquid cooling systems for new ones. I was struggling to sound professional, but I was quite pleased with what we’d accomplished in the last 36 hours — in labs at MIT and on the race course. Then we stole 6 sandwiches each from the EnergyHack luncheon — tuna, turkey and cheese, and avocado — and I slept. Look out for EnergyHack applications next summer for the 2023 round! It’s a great way to delve deep into a topic and find ways to improve it.

A few months ago, I stumbled across  this blog The bloggers are a diverse and multifaceted bunch, but there are thousands of other people at the institute who experience MIT just as deeply as us, and I want to represent them, even if only in small ways. (Note: Unfortunately, I am not immune to the allure of selection bias, so the MIT that is represented here is still some extension of myself and those who are closest to me, which naturally includes some bloggers. Also, I have to anonymize these somehow, but some combinations of majors, years, and belongings are so niche that they are impossible to not recognize. Also, some people literally put their driver licenses on display (Cami Mejia), so I apologize for censorship boxes.) I’ve also been interested in how we tell stories in ways that are nonverbal, which largely has to deal with the things we wear and the things we use. In high school, I used to joke about how I could tell someone’s personality just by looking at their shoes. At MIT, I joke about how I can tell someone’s personality just by looking at their

lately i’ve been thinking about my relationship with art – specifically, art that takes a while to experience, such as books and movies and symphonies. my attention span has gotten worse over the years, to the point that nowadays i regularly find myself skimming through chapters or skipping past uneventful scenes or zoning out for large portions of concerts during college i developed a method for watching shows very efficiently – watch the first two episodes to get a sense of what each character is like, then read the plot summary for every subsequent episode, take note of the scenes that seem interesting or important, and only watch those scenes. this process was very helpful in the sense that it allowed me to finish shows i never would’ve started otherwise – for instance, i do not have the patience to watch  the office  in its entirety but was able to get through the highlights in around 15 hours – but i wonder how much of a show’s message or impact remains when everything unessential is stripped away this mentality doesn’t just influence how i consume art; it also shapes how i create art. sometimes i’ll write blog posts where i have a few key points i want to communicate, so i’ll extensively edit the paragraphs containing those points and polish them; the rest of the paragraphs just become a way to link the main ideas together, and i do not give them as much care as they deserve. something similar can happen when writing music – sometimes when i arrange i’ll have specific climaxes from songs that i care deeply about voicing properly, and then i’ll begrudgingly write the rest of the arrangement to provide the necessary exposition some of these issues can be masked through better technique. but i think improvements in technique alone do not address the fundamental problem, which is that any mentality which views art as trying to achieve specific goals will not be able to appreciate aspects of the artwork which are not tied to those goals. for instance: someone who views a show as trying to progress a main storyline will be bored by scenes from other storylines, someone who understands classical music as the development of a few themes won’t be able to interpret passages not derived from those themes, and so on. and it makes sense that this tunnel vision would translate into creating art as well – if you only have a single specific message you care about communicating, you either end up with a small amount of focused content or a large amount of underdeveloped content. you become lost and unenthused whenever you work on something not directly connected to your message, and as a result you cannot keep up with someone who knows what they want to communicate at every step of creation all this reminds me of a miyazaki quote my friend  showed me : “The most important thing when creating art is that you know what you want to say with it. There are innumerable examples of people making films with a very high level of technique, but only a very fuzzy idea of what they really want to say. When people who know what they want to say make films with a low level of technique, we greatly appreciate the films because there is really something to them. When young, nearly all of us want to be taken seriously, as soon as possible. Perhaps because of this we tend to overemphasize technique.” a few weeks ago i had a call with a startup founder. he mentioned being an early engineer at R, now a popular tech company, and how working there was very rewarding because every day on his subway ride to work he would see people using his work. i asked him if his time at R would still have been rewarding if the company hadn’t gone viral, to which he immediately replied  “no.” i was really surprised by the abruptness of that response. i guess i was expecting him to say that even if R hadn’t been successful, he still would’ve learned a lot and enjoyed his work. i am bothered by the notion that only successful work is rewarding, because it implies that a lot of good work is unrewarding for reasons beyond one’s control. for instance, it means that if five companies worked on developing the same product and the one with the better marketing team won, then only people at one company would be able to consider their work rewarding, even if all five companies had solid execution i’m reminded again of a  conversation  i had with an anti-aging researcher earlier this year. i asked them how they were able to fully commit to working on anti-aging when it’s such an opaque and high-variance field, and they said  i thought about what would happen if i worked in anti-aging and made no progress for ten years and i realized that, even in that scenario, i still wouldn’t hate myself for working on anti-aging. after that i was fine with the risks the other day i was talking to a friend about research and how much we should care about the longevity of our work. i mentioned that i didn’t think longevity should be that important because even short-lived and negative results can be extremely influential. for example, the field of ai research is filled with architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance for a few years before being superseded by the next idea, but those systems were not in vain because each one gave us more intuition about the strengths and drawbacks of various approaches. i want to believe that when someone finally creates agi (artificial general intelligence), it will be because the researchers before them cleared out lots of initial steps and dead ends. reporters and historians may not remember the significance of those predecessors, but people who truly understand the field will be able to see the connections from one idea to the next. i do not know if this will actually turn out to be true, but i hope it does (this isn’t an excuse for intentionally doing useless work though. my point here is that if you have an interesting idea and can’t tell if it’s fruitful or not, you might as well explore it and see what happens. but if you already have lots of evidence that the idea isn’t good and no reason to believe otherwise then it’s still not very smart to pursue that idea) we cannot understand a complex piece of art all at once, so we pick a specific message to pay attention to and analyze the art through that message. we cannot understand the full impact of our work, so we pick a specific outcome and judge our work based on how it influences that outcome. these statements might not actually apply to everyone, but i think they’re an accurate description of what goes on in my head and many other peoples’ heads, of why i find it so easy to reduce art to a single message and work to a single outcome. i am trapped in the present, and the world is too complex to reason about all at once, so i collapse it into a single thread filled with simple causal relationships i wonder what would happen if we were not so limited in our view, if we could see the world as it really is and understand all the ways in which it connects with itself. presumably we would have a more holistic appreciation for everything, and we wouldn’t have to reason so linearly. i’m reminded of the moment from  siddhartha  where the main character finally achieves enlightenment: “‘Did you,’ so Siddhartha asked Vasudeva at one time, ‘did you too learn that secret from the river: that there is no time?’ Vasudeva’s face was filled with a bright smile. ‘Yes, Siddhartha,’ he spoke. ‘It is this what you mean, isn’t it: that the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?’ ‘This it is,’ said Siddhartha. ‘And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real… Siddhartha’s previous births were no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.’ Siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted him. Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time, as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one’s thoughts?” siddhartha essentially claims that, by understanding his entire life as a single concept devoid of time or causality, he is able to overcome his suffering. i’m not sure how literal that was supposed to be, but i do think there is some truth to it – that by learning to view art as an entity without a single intended message i can become a better artist, and that by learning to view history as a body without a single desired outcome i can work without worrying so much about longevity or impact

I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about gratitude. That’s not to say I don’t spend time  gratitude; what I mean is that I don’t expend much energy on pondering the concept of gratitude. In that sense, maybe it’s an underrated emotion. We devote so much towards considering all the dimensions of rage, or resentment, or joy, or grief, but gratitude gets overlooked. There have been many moments where I felt immeasurable amounts of gratitude but didn’t know how to express it adequately. I say “thank you” to the bus driver, so how can “thank you” also be enough for somebody who has caught me while I was falling? But there are limitations to the English language, and more importantly, there are limitations to what is considered socially acceptable. To me, profusely thanking somebody can feel like shoving a gift in their face that they didn’t ask for. Sometimes I need to use horror to compel myself towards gratitude, like,  . That’s the philosophy of the killer from the  movies, right? He forces his victims to endure so much suffering to “prove” they are grateful for the gift of life. At least, this is my understanding of his motive after binge-reading Wikipedia plot summaries at three a.m., since I am much too soft-hearted to watch horror for more than two minutes. Even when we aren’t the terrified playthings of a sadistic killer, we are expected to perform gratitude. Recently, Selena Gomez was eviscerated for purportedly not showing enough gratitude towards her kidney donor; at any awards ceremony where the winner is expected to give a speech, their speech had better include expressing thanks to everyone who helped them get to that stage. A perceived lack of gratitude is indicative of a lack of modesty, or so the logic goes. We think of gratitude as a moral virtue, and like other moral virtues, we expect it to be signaled. But is gratitude a moral virtue? Is  emotion a moral virtue? I certainly don’t want to ascribe morality to my emotions. Anyway, it’s Thanksgiving, and here is some of what I am thankful for: my mother, my father, and my brother; my friends, both far and near; my grandparents; November sunshine; the privilege of learning; home-cooked meals; my classmates and professors; public transportation; everybody who has taken a chance on me; and you, for reading this far. with some friends who made dumplings

This semester, I was lucky enough to take the beginner glassblowing course in the MIT Glass Lab, where I spent eight weeks learning about the ancient art form. One heavily-emphasized aspect of the class was “safety” (as if I’d ever need that when working with molten liquids). Here are five things that you can’t (or at least shouldn’t) eat in the Glass Lab, tempting as it may be. 1. Hot Glass Doesn’t Taste Like Honey Imagine this – it’s 8 pm, and you’ve been blowing glass for four hours straight. You forgot to bring food in a green take-out box from Maseeh lunch, and compensating by drinking copious amounts of water isn’t working anymore. Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a glimmering caramel orb. Its golden glow beckons you forth as it slowly drips off the blowpipe like warm honey. Mmm, hot glass Do you dare to reach forth and scoop a spoonful for yourself? If you’re a Glass Lab instructor, then probably not. Apparently, hot glass glows not because it’s the forbidden food of the gods but because it’s heated to thousands of degrees in the furnace. Talk about defective! I tried protesting that the glass must be jam-packed with the energy I need to get through the day because of all that heat, but they weren’t having it. They then proceeded to lecture me about “lab safety” and “that’s not how human physiology works”. Naturally, I zoned out almost immediately. While they droned on about “third-degree burns”, I gazed around the room and crafted a counterargument. “If it’s not honey, why does it stick to things? Checkmate, safety nerds!” I proudly exclaimed. Hot glass sticking to itself (just like honey) Much to my dismay, the instructors conveniently had an explanation for this too. It turns out molten glass isn’t sticky, but instead so hot that everything melts onto it… or so they’d like me to believe. 2. Glass Frit Doesn’t Pop In Your Mouth The subsequent disappointment came just a few days later when we started working with coloured glass. In beginner glassblowing, we used glass frit – tiny shards of glass – to apply the colour. All sorts of different flavours of glass frit Looks familiar? Yum Just like how you sometimes roll a lollipop in pop rocks, you also roll a gob of hot glass in the frit to apply it. They even come in fun, fruity flavours like “vanilla” and “orange”! But alas, glass frit is nothing more than eye candy, and I begrudgingly refrained from eating it. 3. Prince Rupert’s Drops Aren’t Exotic Hard Candies When I first heard of Prince Rupert’s drops, I thought (as most people naturally would) they’d be some exotic hard candy first concocted for a capricious Victorian-era European prince. I wondered what their flavour could be – perhaps blackcurrant with a hint of ginger? In any case, when I heard that there would be a demonstration involving them at the Glass Lab, I ensured that I’d be the first to get my hands on a few of these mysterious confections. Lo and behold, my dietary dreams were once again dashed when I learned that Prince Rupert’s drops were nothing more than beads of molten glass dropped into cold water. A Prince Rupert’s drop imaged with a polariscope. Looks pretty exotic (and delicious) to me While one of the instructors excitedly explained how internal stresses render the bulbous head bulletproof, I sulked in the corner and fantasized about what could have been. But then I had an idea – what if they were telling me all this so they could keep the Prince Rupert’s drops for themselves? I was just about to pop one in my mouth when someone noticed and swatted it out of my hand and onto the floor, shattering it instantly. “So much for bulletproof”, I thought, convinced that it was a mechanism to release all the flavour at once. Once again, the instructors conveniently had an explanation at hand – this time, they said that even a slight nick to the tail would cause the entire thing to explode. An explosion of flavour All right then, MIT Glass Lab, keep your secrets. 4. The Pineapple Mold Isn’t a Fruit At this point, I’d gotten it into my head that the Glass Lab does not produce candy. I was starting to feel confident in my abilities to distinguish between edible and inedible when they threw yet another curveball at me, this time in the form of a fancy new piece of equipment – a so-called pineapple mould. A pineapple mould Seriously? This thing doesn’t even look like a pineapple. Get it together, MIT. ??? At least I got to make a cool cup using it. The indentations from the pineapple mould trap bubbles in the glass 5. You Can’t Make Pie Using Glass Pumpkins MIT is famous for its so-called “great glass pumpkin patch”, where they sell hundreds of hand-blown glass pumpkins. A beautiful glass pumpkin from the 2020 pumpkin patch I couldn’t snag one for myself this year, so I jumped at the opportunity to make my own pumpkin as a final project. Surprisingly, everything went well in the process! My own glass pumpkin (with some chemical reactions between the colours)! But right as I was about to put the pumpkin into the annealing oven, one of the instructors joked about it looking very appetizing but being “unfit for human consumption”. Wow, so you’re telling me I can’t even make a basic pumpkin pie out of this? Thanksgiving. Ruined. Anyway, enjoy some pictures of other stuff I’ve made in the Glass Lab this semester: Previous Next #Glassblowing #MIT Glass Lab

I’ve mentioned in the past that I’m taking CMS.335 Short Attention Span Documentary. Abby ’20 has  blogged about this class in the past I’ll start off with the same things as Abby said: I’ve always wanted to make cool shit at MIT. Seeing as I didn’t end up as a pure engineering major, my methods of making things sit in the digital world, mainly in the form of blogposts. But this semester I wanted to challenge myself creatively, hence why I took both a comic book writing class and this class. I’ve always had an interest in making videos, but found that everything I made was always somewhat unsatisfactory or a little off. I thought that the best way, then, to combat this is to force myself to make videos. The assignments this semester were the same as they were in the past. We were tasked first to create a portrait of a person or a place. Abby showscases this video in her blog, where she shows off MacGregor desk. I personally did my video on my friend Jovita L. ’23, but she didn’t want the video blasted on the blogs. The second assignment was then to create a 3-5 minute video on an issue, either showing both sides of an issue or heavily advocating for one side. I chose to do my video on MIT’s closed campus policy and why campus should be open. That’s kind of a spicy opinion, so we’re going to move forward from that blog and instead focus on my third assignment. The third assignment was to create a 5-7 minute documentary that combines the first and second assignment: create a portrait of a person or a place and walk through some issue related to it. I decided to do my third documentary on myself, my media journey, and my reliance on the Internet as a means of not feeling lonely. I wanted this documentary to represent growth, not only from where I was to where I am, but also make use of all the things I learned this past semester with respect to documentary making. Making a documentary is such hard fucking work, but I’ve learned so much about the process in these past couple weeks. For the first two assignments, I gathered
 
B-roll ⁠ 01 Secondary footage that serves as supplement to the main shot. As a result of this choice, my documentary often had B-roll footage showing that didn’t make sense or was irrelevant to whatever the narrator was saying. The benefit, though, of having a documentary about yourself is that you are the narrator and   get to decide all of the narration. Because of this, I was able to write out my script for my documentary first and then I broke it down into separate scenes. For each paragraph break, I added a short description of what I envisioned the footage to be for every bit of narration. I found this incredibly effective since it gave me a shotlist by the end of it: a mix of archival footage I needed to gather, and other footage I needed to film. One of the biggest things my professor has emphasized in class is having a   — a structure that the audience can follow to understand where the documentary has been and where it is going. This can be as simple as (1) introducing a topic, (2) providing a pro of that topic and (3) providing a con. In past documentaries, I never really gave clear   to my structure, and instead went ahead with what “felt right” or simply went off of vibes. This time around, though, I made sure to pay careful attention to what I was trying to convey. I structured everything in chronological order and made sure to highlight the purpose of each section: loneliness experienced as an only child, turning to the Internet for community, communities dying out and needing something to fill that space, finding Tumblr and using One Direction as a coping method, getting to college and no longer needing something to fill that space now that I was finally secure. There are definitely improvements I can make on the narrative, but I feel as though this is the first time I’ve actually had a clear vision and path for my narrative. Normally, everything is shot with an iPhone but I disliked that so I actually purchased a vlogging camera for this class. I purchased a Sony ZV-1 (I thought I lost my Canon PowerShot G7 but, in fact, it was just in my room. I found this out a day ago. I am devastated I spent $800 on a new camera when mine has been here all along. But it’s okay, I got new equipment) not just for the class, but for
 
any vlogging I may do after the class. ⁠ 02 I've given a lot of thought as to what's going to happen to my blog after I graduate. I've decided I'm probably going to start a Medium page for blogposts, as well as revive my dead YouTube channel just in case anyone does want to keep up with what I do post graduation. The class gave us some equipment as well, such as a microphone, a tripod, and a filming light. For my first two documentaries, I ended up not using the tripod as much as I would have liked and not exploring it enough. The tripod is actually incredibly useful for smooth pans, stable shots, and level shots. My first two documentaries have some shaky shots in them, or things are slightly cut off at the top and makes for a distracting viewing experience. This time around, I made sure to actually, well, use the tripod. The only disappointment I had with the documentary this time around is the fact that since   the subject of the documentary, I can’t control the camera. As a result, there were some shots where I thought it would be a great addition to zoom in, or to pan to me, or even walk backwards as I walked forwards. One of these particularly takes place when I say something along the lines of “But time stops for no one…” In my head, when I planned the script, I wanted to do
 
Dolly Zoom ⁠ 03 the camera physically moves backward while the operator is zooming the camera in, causing the subject in frame to stay the same size while the foreground and background are distorted 
I didn’t have anyone to film me, ⁠ 04 See: Did not trust anyone to film this shot the way I envisioned it. A lot of this documentary uses a lot of archival footage and images to get the image across. I spent a good chunk of time trying to find an adequate representations of 2005-2007 Internet, such as clips of Club Penguin, Pixie Hollow, and Webkinz. A good chunk of the documentary is also about my first Internet community experiences on a Minecraft server, Stephencraft, a fan-made and -run server dedicated to YouTuber Stephen Georg. My past documentaries relied very little on archival footage and images, so often times I would grab whatever looked like it fit and rolled with it. This time around, though, I wanted to make sure that I actually used relevant good footage. Because my laptops from that era (2014-2017) are long since dead, I actually got back in touch with a lot of the folks I used to talk to back then to get some extra footage and photos. It was an incredible nostalgia trip, and I cried a little bit after catching up with so many of my friends from the past. It’s crazy to think that I would not be the person I am today had it not been for this era of my life, and I was so happy I was able to capture some of that in my documentary and pay homage to the people who helped me back then. I mentioned earlier how I spent more time focusing on  . In past documentaries, I never really understood how to transition from idea to idea, opting typically for some rough jump cut. For this documentary, I paid special attention on transitions. I did this by creating
 
sequences ⁠ 05 A set of clips that contains at least one vidoe track and one audio track You can see I have things titled “CHILDHOOD” or “ENTER ONE DIRECTION” or “END OF AN ERA” to visually see on my Premiere timeline where one section starts and another begins. A lot of my transitions are brought about by fade ins and fade outs. Through this, I was also able to determine where to transition and how to do tone shifts for each. Which brings me to my next point… For my first documentary, I played a lo-fi Tetris mix in the background since Jovita focused on her journey with Tetris, whereas my second documentary had no music in the background at all. Music is incredibly powerful, as it is an easy way to set the tone of a documentary, or even sections of a documentary. I tried to be meticulous when it came to choosing music, but choosing music is incredibly  . I found myself a lot of the time with a specific tune I had in mind, but had no idea how to write this down into words. For the introduction, I envisioned synth-like music that came in waves, but had no idea what the tone of that was or how to express that. Other times, like during the college scene, I wanted something more nostalgic. Originally I envisioned something like a piano, with twinkly notes, but found that all the piano pieces I found online were too dramatic and intense or not noticeable enough. It was incredibly frustrating and even now I don’t know how people find music properly for this kind of stuff. I still am looking for a nostalgic enough song to go at the end of the documentary for the closing section. Another strange thing that happened was that once I put a song in, it was impossible   to hear that section without it. In the introduction, I use an instrumental version of Robbers by the 1975. From that point on, I could no longer hear in my head what I   envisioned which was super duper difficult since I knew Robbers wasn’t exactly scratching the itch I initially had, but now that initial itch was just. Lost in my head. TLDR: Music HARD. Once I had all these things together, I looked and saw that my documentary was 8 minutes and 44 seconds long, which..was far too long for the requirement. So thus I began cutting and cutting, removing bits and pieces here and there and there are still so many jarring transitions I don’t like. I have a couple plans of things to edit, such as adjusting some of the volumes (there’s a really quiet bit right after the I DONT NEED YOU ANYMORE pops up on screen) and changing some of the transitions (there’s a really weird cut during the TIME STOPS FOR NO ONE bit) and maybe even refilming (I would love to attempt that god damned dolly shot) some bits. But…overall, after all of this, it was time for Step 5. And bracing yourself for the critiques because this documentary is your baby you’ve been editing for three hours every night for the past two weeks and you absolutely love and adore her but with every rewatch your notice more and more flaws and it breaks your heart every single time because why can’t you get it right? But also you’re so proud of yourself for doing all of that but next time you hope to do it  . #CMS.335

i’ve learned that people here rely on each other. in a greuling academic environment, you most often turn to the people around you for support. people here are so painfully kind. within two months of staying here, i already feel indebted to nearly everyone on hall. when all is said and done, i feel better. but i don’t know how to do it in return. i see someone stressed, upset, and feel the urge to comfort them. and they are clearly not ok. i don’t want to ask them “are you sure you’re ok?” because that feels demanding and i don’t want to intrude on the space they need. so i stay silent. and then i realize i’m not helping by keeping quiet, so i desperately think of something to say instead. but what do i say? what do i say to my friend who’s usually happy but right now looks like they’re about to cry? i don’t want to force them to be happy again, because it’s better to let them heal on their own time. i want to tell them “it’s okay not to be okay,” i want them to dump it on me like i once did to them, but what if they don’t want to? it takes a certain amount of trust in someone to confide to them your sadness, and i’m unsure whether they trust me yet. after all, we’ve only barely known each other for two and a half months. they keep sitting there, or walking, or typing away on their laptop, and so i ask: and then they either tell me or lean their head towards me so i can ruffle their hair a little bit. what do i do next? i always get stuck at this part because i’m not sure whether i’ve annoyed them or made them feel better. half the time i just keep staying silent, and hoping my presence would tell them that i’m open to listening. how presumptuous of me to think that i mean enough to them to comfort them just by being there. i mean, i’m not saying anything, i’m not doing anything, and hell, i might be in their way if they needed to be alone in that moment. i wish they would tell me what they think, but you can’t force people to talk. so i wait for something to change. i wait for   to say something, or feel better, or worse (i really hope they don’t), but nothing happens. i back away for a minute but like a fruit fly buzzing around rotting fruit, i come back and hope something happens. most of the time it doesn’t. and so it repeats. what repeats? and i come and go and come and go around them and buzz internally like a fly, wondering whether to do something. so i don’t end up doing anything. eventually i leave or they leave or i stay long enough to mirror what they do, sitting side by side, psetting next to them, or walking next to them trying to match my footsteps with theirs plodding the ground with the same rhythm, in some ridiculous futile way to try and understand what they’re feeling.

I failed an
 
18.600 ⁠ 01 probability and random variables cue the five stages of grief: in which I wake up, horrified, with about twenty minutes left and a blank exam in front of me, and then start speeding through it because surely something is better than nothing and maybe time will slow down enough for me to finish this exam or maybe I still retain   from my contest math days and can totally do a notoriously difficult exam in a fraction of the time I walk out of the exam room and aimlessly wander around campus for a while. I’m mad at myself — I’m at risk of failing a math class, and there’s still a very small part of me that lives in contest-math-world and feels insecure about herself and needs to prove her worth to everyone around her by excelling at math. I’m mad at MIT: I’m taking 102 units in an attempt to start my MEng next semester, and I do not want to be taking 102 units, and I somehow don’t have any better options than what I’m currently doing. I vaguely want to shake my fist at the sky and ask what I did wrong to deserve being this tired and this hosed and this abandoned by institutional support systems, and I want to curl up in a ball and demand “why don’t I get to be a perfectly average student with perfectly average problems?!!” to  , anyone, as if this student existed anyways Maybe dropping 80% of my classes will make S^3 take me seriously — maybe I have finally failed hard enough to prove that I needed help as a frosh and they screwed up then and I am not just
 
one more grade-grubbing premed   trying to exploit the system.  ⁠ 02 to be clear I find this stereotype pretty harmful and dislike the fact that we, institutionally, tell anyone asking for help that they do not need help (hint: they will not.) I submit a drop form for the class to my advisor, mostly because I don’t want to have to think about that exam again. I want to drop a couple extra classes out of spite, mostly because dropping 18.600 ruins my carefully planned schedule anyways and I am deeply and existentially tired from my silly little attempt at 102 units and I will still be deeply and existentially tired at 90 units. I want to withdraw from MIT entirely and become a hermit in the woods — surely I can figure out how to make enough money to Not Starve — because I do not want to do any of this anymore So I’ve failed an exam. Possibly in a ridiculous kind of way, but what happened happened, and so now what? 
I did not do well on this exam because I didn’t remember how to take words like “marginal probability” and turn them to math terms, even if I knew how to do the math from there. I would know this better if I had spent more time with the material over the last few weeks, at least enough to be able to go from word problems to mathematical notation I did not do well on this exam because I had four midterms and slept an average of 2 hours/night this week, and my average last week is not much better. My brain is  probably full of cellular debris right now I’ve been doing pretty well on the psets, where I can look up what terms like “marginal probability” refer to, so I think I am probably good on the actual math at hand and would not hugely benefit from spending a lot of time going through lectures and retaking all my notes I text my grad student that I am going to finish writing a protocol relevant to my SuperUROP project tomorrow and take a 36-hour nap I look at my last exam and pset grades, and calculate whether I might be able to scrape a passing grade in the class assuming a 0 on this exam, and I might. I make a small list of vocabulary terms next to their math equivalent and tape it to the wall above my desk. Even if I drop the class, they’re probably still worth learning 
I can’t definitively say that my poor performance is
 
solely caused by sleep deprivation ⁠ 03 I do remember enough to say that correlation isn't causation! I’m still kind of upset that I am suddenly doing considerably worse than I expected in a subject that I pride myself on being good at, but hey, P/NR exists and I might as well use one sometime. My drop form is approved, but not submitted to registrar — I’m going to give it another day and reconsider whether I have enough bandwidth to study for this final. After all, the worst thing that could happen is an NR, which means basically   happens, and that’s really not that bad I go find some things that make me happy. My research makes me happy; cats make me happy; chocolate is holding up what’s left of my sanity; and so now I am back to writing my silly lil protocol while hanging out with  PUF 
chocolate ⁠ 04 I definitely did not stash some in my backpack at the last blogger meeting Things will be okay. Maybe my 18.600 grade won’t be, but he’s a very small thing, and therefore can be treated as negligible. Things (approximately) will be okay.

i’ve been so busy and sad and angry about everything lately, that it’s been harder to notice the nice and pretty things in life: sailing on the charles, noticing how the smallest shifts in seating rock the boat, the tension of not-quite-capsizing, square dancing, the joy i get when working together with other dancers to compute moves while walking to the beat, the other bloggers, and the zany meetings we have, and when we’re together i feel the strength of each personality taking up space in the conference room, being in the esp office in the late afternoon, opening the doors to see the lights turned off and people napping, sitting on a couch next to a friend i know’s been busy recently, napping peacefully, and taking a picture and sending it to him to tease him, reminiscing about the time i  spent a whole day bouncing on and off trains with a friend working with others in the sipb office on programming projects, seeing students younger than me excited about things i wish i was excited about, eating pizza and drinking soda in our tiny hackathon, being in splash, the first in-person splash in three years, and watching those younger students with their parents a few feet behind them encouraging their child to talk to us to check in, watching older students smiling widely when they get to put pronoun stickers on their nametags, sitting in help desk and trying to let my smile show through my mask as i give people directions, walking to the 26-100 stage, our largest lecture hall, the av tech handing me the microphone and talking about cardioids, and holding that microphone while talking to dozens of high schoolers about ridiculous survival scenarios, playing spirit island with friends on a friday afternoon in our weekly tradition, where we keep talking about that web app we’ll never build, then teaching spirit island to some splash students two days later, and watching them plan and plan over the best thing to do only minutes later, how fast they learn the game, eating out with a friend group that hasn’t been together in a while, and still isn’t completely together, but you gotta take the victories when they come, at that japanese barbecue place in harvard we’ve been to lots, where we’re now old enough to order alcohol than when we last went together, four years ago, and going to a practice room in building 4, where some play piano and others sing, as we ticked the hours past sitting around and singing songs from yesteryear, the same way we did four years ago, except now we are drunk, and when we sang industry baby someone made a joke about how we’re all industry babies now, applying to jobs and signing offers and in a few cases going to grad school, we are all old, now, and i understand what fun meant when they wrote  we are young i once feared i’ll become a silent oath i told myself, all those years ago, that i’d never stop being grateful for my life, a promise broken, a vow i’ll strive to never break again.

here I’ve never really wanted to be beautiful. There were moments I wished to be desirable, and I suppose that is adjacent to beauty, but beauty does not give others the feeling of an elastic band stretched and released within their abdomens. That was powerful, to compel stirrings like that in other people. I never saw what was powerful about the kind of beauty that arose from symmetry, from clear skin or a pleasing smile. These days, I see the term “beautiful” used quite often, sometimes to describe physical appearance, but more often to describe something intangible—a relationship, an experience, a math proof. It’s overused, I think, to the point of meaninglessness. I don’t want my friendships to be  , I don’t even know what that means. I want my friendships to thrive on mutual compassion, trust, honesty; my best friend from high school has never hesitated to call me out on my bullshit, and I value our relationship so much for that, but to paint it all as simply “beautiful” would be to erase all of the nuances of what we’ve built over the past seven years. To be honest, I harbor some skepticism towards those who seem too preoccupied with aesthetic, because aesthetic can get in the way of truth. That was one reason why I switched my major from humanities (yes, MIT has an entire department called “humanities”) to math; I would read papers that seemed to offer brilliant observations about the world, and then later I would think, I took two Folklore and Mythology classes at Harvard and have this distinct memory of sitting in seminar, watching a classmate pontificate about  manifest destiny A lot of truth is ugly, a lot of truth doesn’t adhere to a brand image or a poetic phrase or whatever else might be considered beautiful. And that isn’t to say truth is inherently good or what one should automatically strive for, but that’s for a post on another day. But what I mean here is that prioritizing beauty doesn’t simply lead to banality, it can lead to false assertions. That’s the entire point of a political slogan, right? Here’s a slick phrase that sounds nice. Who cares if it’s true? But I meander. I’ve been lucky enough to witness a lot of beauty in the world; I spent a year in New Zealand and never failed to be astonished by lush foliage and volcanic mountaintops and green-blue seas. But whenever I tried to write about everything I saw, I could never come up with anything meaningful to say. (Sure, I could lean into an environmentalist angle,  , but that was backpropagation: searching for the justification after I already knew the claim, and anyway, I believe that nature and all of its miracles will persist long after humankind have vanished into oblivion.) It was pretty, and it didn’t   to be more than pretty, but it was not interesting to write about something being pretty. Don’t get me wrong, none of this means that I am more intellectual or thoughtful or whatever than those who hike up hills just for a breathtaking view: a blue mist shrouding the horizon, a yawning green valley below. None of this is to say that I don’t adore beauty the same way anybody else does. Not every moment in life needs to be intellectualized, and I have a tendency to overthink everything. The summer I was in Paris, I visited the Musée d’Orsay over and over even though I thought Impressionism was like pop music, empty calories. But even now, I still love the way Monet and Cézanne render the world dreamy and windswept, transforming the mundane into something magical. i love monet’s water lilies series

Alan: Hi! You have words— Fatima: and we want your words— Alan: for our poetry. Fatima: For the past semester, Alan and I have been reading poems that I write for my poetry workshop class and Alan writes for their writing thesis.  Alan: Every Sunday, Fatima brings a poem which is invariably in some new form, as the class requires. Every Sunday, I bring a sestina. Fatima: If you didn’t know, a  sestina Alan: Sestinas are an…interesting form. The constraints are fairly lax but the form is long and repetitive, forcing you to return to a topic over and over again. It is a form whose flexibility
 
I adore, ⁠ 01 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">including writing <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/id-like-to-write-a-happy-post/">one on the blogs</a> last semester! Fatima: Last week, I also had sestina as the prompt for my poetry class. On Thursday, Alan and I stayed up till 3 and competitively wrote a sestina each. By competitively, I mean, we were trying to see who would finish first(I did). While writing it, we decided it would be fun to exchange the words in our poems and write another sestina with the end words that the other person’s first sestina used.    Alan: So, on Sunday, we competitively wrote sestinas with each other’s end words—a race which I won. We have started gradually converting the rest of 4W to the cult of poetry (and sestinas in particular), and, now, we are starting on the blogs. Fatima: Once again, we want your words— Alan: and we want them  now  in the next two weeks! Fatima: We will write one, or two, or three, or— Alan: We will write a few sestinas each with the end words which you give us, and then we will return to the blogs, and I will figure out if it is okay for portions of my thesis to be under a  Creative Commons – Non-Commercial – Share-Alike license. Fatima: Have fun with the words, we will have fun with the poems!  Alan: Just remember, in a neighboring room, someone is always cutting an absurd amount of cilantro!

a study is being conducted this photo is false because classrooms are never this full at 9 am, or indeed any other hour of day cool because scrawled half-finished notes magically appear in your notebook but you have no memory of writing them. they are not very legible but it’s cool that they’re there *should* earn the ire of your professor and thereafter you feel guilty whenever he’s nice to you maybe you are learning through osmosis? quiet and empty typically takes place at godly hours, like 1pm, when you are aware of which behaviors do and do not follow societal norms.  desktops get more and more comfortable as the semester goes on sometimes the TA for the next recitation comes in and does a double take, like, “Hey, are you okay?”

I competed in a lot of robotics competitions throughout high school, so I knew what to expect by the time I became a senior. Each round had the same format: the autonomous stage and the driving stage. The driving stage is what it sounds like: you drive the robot around the arena with your controller and score as many points as you can. The autonomous stage comes before the driver stage, where the robot runs on its own and gathers as many points as it can before time is up. Coding autonomous mode for our robot was a pain in the ass. It was all about calibrating, re-calibrating, re-calibrating. Progress was never an upward linear progression. One day, the robot may score a lot of points. The next day, the robot may score zero points, simply because a motor screw was loose or a small bump in the mat changed the whole trajectory of the bot. And then we have to tweak the code, tweak the bot, line the bot back up, and try again. Even though a majority of the attempts were spent watching the robot ram into the wall and destroy bits of itself in the process, we’d stay up until 2 a.m. in hopes that we’d get to see a sliver of change before we call it a night. Figuratively speaking, that sums up the past few months. Despite countless attempts to re-calibrate myself so that I’ll finally be on the right track to succeed in my classes, I keep banging into a figurative wall over and over, until something figuratively comes loose and I have to spend extra time figuratively fixing myself back up. And then I get up every morning to start the cycle over again.  And again.  All while hoping that going through the damage will all be worth it. That’s been something eating away at me lately whenever I think about my major. “Is getting through this courseroad all going to be worth it? Or am I just putting myself through an unnecessary struggle?” Why I didn’t major in something I had prior knowledge in, compared to my pitiful background in anything AI-related, still eludes me. On the other hand, I don’t have a problem with majoring in  
6-4. ⁠ 01 Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making But what do I really want to do with my life after undergrad? I don’t know. Industry? Academia? I don’t even know if I want to go to grad school. That’s fine if I don’t know what I want to do in the future. I can just do my best now and see where that takes me. But it gets harder to hold onto that hope when my “best” turns out to be mediocre at most.  
S^3 ⁠ 02 Student Support Services It’s been hard to stay motivated, especially without a goal to aim towards after undergrad. No matter how much effort I put into my classes, I can’t seem to get a result that I’m happy with. I don’t have a lot to show for my interest in AI other than a string of personal failures. Most adults I’ve asked have told me that it’s the journey that matters and not the grade. It’s a beautiful thought, but I feel really stupid when I keep preaching the same thing to myself when my exam grades can’t hit the class median no matter how much effort I put in to make a change. How long can I hope that this time,  , I won’t run into the wall again? How many more changes do I have to make to prevent the same disappointing outcome, all while I’m running out of time and energy to even get back up? How many more hits can I take until I collapse? How do I know that I could’ve been better off majoring in something that I had more experience in, instead of sustaining all of this damage? Would I have been more well-adapted doing anything other than 6-4? Something I learned from high school robotics is that you can’t predict how a robot is going to look like by the end of the season. Every competing robot has to play the same game. Maybe you’re stacking cones one year, or picking up cubes the next. Those are invariant qualities of the game that you can’t avoid, in the same way that I can’t avoid getting through strenuous coursework to graduate. But you might start and end the season with a completely different robot that plays the game more efficiently than the bot you envisioned in the beginning. It’s a winding journey, and it sometimes takes watching your first robot completely fall apart in front of a live audience, or ram itself into the wall over and over for three hours straight, with no improvement in sight. Inevitably, you just have to suck it up and take the robot apart yourself so you can make it into something better. The very robot you put so much time, energy, and unrelenting hope into. Those were the some of the most vulnerable moments I’ve experienced on the team. I didn’t have anything to prove my skills when the robot’s nothing but scattered pieces. I had no clue whether the next design will be any better than the one we had before. It could all just be a big waste of time. It hurt to fundamentally change something we worked so hard on. But if we didn’t take those steps back, we wouldn’t have gone as far as we ended up going. It hurts to change myself at a fundamental level because of the crushing vulnerability that comes with it. It hurts to break myself down—and my past methods—because I have to change myself in order to move on after a failure. I have to change the means of success that I relied on for so long. One quote that’s lingered in my mind a lot lately is from  “Most people only have a few significant alternate life paths so close to them. But you, here, you’re capable of anything, because you’re so bad at everything.” Failure is not the antithesis of progress, or even success. But damn, is it painful. It sucks failing an exam. It sucks getting internship rejections. It sucks to make a promise that I’ll be kinder to myself this semester, only to beat myself up every morning for not doing better. I don’t have a grand lesson to wrap this up. But if there’s something I’m trying to improve in, it’s that moving forward requires a lot of faith in yourself. That’s hard for me. I like to say that I’m a realist just to stroke my ego, but I’m more pessimistic than the average person. I have a bad habit of focusing on all of the outcomes that could go wrong. I just need to remind myself that calculating the pros and cons of every possible outcome isn’t going to help me optimize my life for the better—it’s just going to make my anxiety worse. Plus, multiple successes in a row doesn’t necessarily guarantee a greater outcome. Some of the better outcomes have failures thrown into the path. In hindsight, that’s how it’s been for me in the past. I have to accept that there are some questions about the trajectory of my life that only time can answer. It’s not my job as a puny mortal being on this earth to answer them. In the meantime, I just have to tell myself that I’ll be okay and I   find a way to get over these failures, no matter how many of them get thrown at me. It’s not wishful thinking. It’s the best I can do for myself.

Many a night and moon ago, I was climbing, and my phone slipped from my pocket. Both my hands were occupied holding the rest of me aloft, so I could only watch as my phone tumbled down, down, and crashed on the cement below. I scrambled down to salvage it, only to find the screen severely cracked. I pressed power and a half-centimeter-wide line lit up; the rest stayed black. I went to get the screen repaired. This took going to two shops, as my phone
 
was ⁠ 01 spoiler alert I then put my phone away, the half-centimeter line of screen in the middle being insufficient to guide me, and set to eke out directions on my own. I was near Central, where I’d lived last summer, so I knew a nearby cafe that would have wifi. I walked there, checked online with a few other repair shops and found one that did have a 3a screen. I glanced at the walking directions, but I was so used to being able to double-check that I didn’t memorize the street names. Midway there, I realized I’d forgotten a turn, and dipped inside the nearest store to ask the owner for directions. It was a chic liquor store and the owner wasn’t inside, so I chatted with another customer while waiting for him to get back.  All this was somewhat funny, since my phone back in high school, a hand-me-down from my big sister, had about the roaming power of a Commodore-64. I would regularly memorize directions. When I was travelling the west coast, I drew a lot of maps on paper, cross-streets and exits labelled. I hadn’t exercised that part of my brain outside of MIT’s campus for a while. I wondered again if I’d lost a certain wildness, if I had grown too settled in modern day luxuries. Or maybe memorizing directions isn’t a necessary skill any more. I got my phone back the next day. The screen was perfect. No one had texted me anything of dire importance. The speakers sounded like someone was crunching tinfoil over them, but I mostly used headphones anyway. “Why didn’t you just get another phone?” my friend asked. “It would probably cost about as much as repairs. Not the newest model, but the next-newest.” “No,” I said, and said something about resisting the machine, and how I liked my finger-sensing button. My phone was smaller than newer models; it fit into my pocket, and I could type one-handed.  Then, about three weeks later, I was climbing something else. I learn from my mistakes: this time, I asked my friend to take my phone. I didn’t think to do this until I was already eight feet off the ground, however, and between me leaning down and him reaching up, we fumbled the handoff. My phone tumbled down, down, and crashed on the stones below.  My phone must have been fragile from its last fall — one of many, since the time I dropped it at a bus stop in the middle of northern Italy one night — because the screen went black immediately, even though the cracks seemed minor. I was in Connecticut, so I had a glorious time navigating bus directions from my MIT loaner laptop. On the bus, I wrote poetry and napped, stared out the window with no soundtrack.  Life sans phone was easier the second time around. Fortunately for me, all of MIT’s undergrad community is active on Messenger, so I didn’t miss out on social life while hunting for another repair shop that stocked 3a screens. “By the way, sorry if I’m ignoring your texts,” I told my little sister on Instagram. “My phone is deceased.” She wrote back, “Oh dw I hadn’t texted you.” I got the phone fixed again, in Allston, next to a corner store with imported Mexican goods. At this point I wasn’t sure if it was worth the price, especially since it came back sluggish, but I was still committed to resisting the machine.  And then. I was asking a friend at EC for pset help. It was late, I was exhausted, but there was one problem left and the pset was due at midnight. I was sitting on the carpet, my notebook, laptop, and phone on the floor around me. Then somebody’s foot came down, down, and crunched onto my phone. I did not feel anything at all, just laughed. Maybe it’s a curse, I thought, in a sleepless haze. MIT let me climb somewhere cool, but ate my phone in exchange. The cost of adventures in Connecticut? A spiderweb of cracks. The cost of pset help? You got it. Maybe I should get more sleep; then I might not fumble hand-offs, might think to take my phone off the floor. Maybe I should invest in pants with zippered pockets. Or make daily sacrifices to the frowning gods of this place, to satiate their thirst on something more replaceable. I no longer remember why, but I was so hosed that week I didn’t have time to visit a repair shop for many days. I began carrying my loaner iPad around to check Messenger quickly and listen to music en route to classes. All told, I spent about a week without a phone. I found that walking places disconnected actually felt nice. I had music, but my iPad was in my bag, so I wasn’t skipping songs or scrolling as I went. I didn’t miss the connection at all. During lecture and pset sessions, I consistently found myself itching to pick up my phone, even though I had access to email and messenger on other devices. I didn’t break my Instagram addiction, but rather realized how deep it lies, because I began googling instagram.com on my iPad. Somehow doing this felt sillier when the screen was so large. Alas.  The main inconvenience of being phone-free showed up in practical ways — I go to Harvard for class four days a week, and my iPad didn’t have data, which meant that looking up bus routes or using BlueBikes off campus was a struggle. I went on runs in deep, bone-crushing silence, during which I told time by the angle of the sun. Finally I hauled myself to a new repair shop. They didn’t have 3a screens, but said they would order some. “We’ll call you when it arrives. What number should we call?” “Um,” I said, and held up my broken phone. Admittedly some people have families in the city, and others memorize their friends’ numbers. I, however, simply did some price calculations, then let the machine swallow me and ordered a new phone.  It’s kinda shiny. It doesn’t have a physical fingerprint-sensing button, and the digital one is crap, which is irritating. Mostly I hate how delicate it feels. I like having things that are breakable, cheap, and therefore easily replaced, so that having them lost or broken wouldn’t ruin
 
me. ⁠ 02 there are counter-arguments to this, of course, like the value of having something good that lasts. Farewell to my old phone. He served me well. He is sitting with a big crack in the bottom of my drawer, waiting for inadvertent hands to grope around for charging cords one night and close upon him. But that’ll be a story for another blog. On the bright side, my low-quality android camera is now upgraded to a mid-quality android camera, which brings me one step closer to not relying on my friends for group photos.

Song:  Down to Earth  from Wall-E. “I found myself pleasantly surprised with how well she was able to hold my attention with math content.”- Anonymous Reviewer aka Jeremy in my last post. Some (including my own mom) may find it shocking that I am as (relatively) social as I am given that nearly every conversation with me involves either math, existentialism, or education. But in truth, I can talk to anyone. Well, mostly. Some people want to purely engage in small talk– and that’s okay! If I introduce myself and all you want to say is “This weather is wild” and “It’s that time of the semester am-I-right?”, then I will happily listen and give the common responses: “Yes this weather is quite ‘wild’” and “Ha, yep, that time of the semester when [insert vague statement about being hosed].” I wouldn’t really count this as a conversation, but it certainly is small talk. If the small talk evolves into the classic yet conversationally loaded “What’s your major?,”  then  the fun begins. I give the usual 30 second spiel about how I’m majoring in math and really interested in education, to which there are a few common responses: 1)  Not following up with this subject at all . If this occurs, then my brain shifts back into small talk mode. We don’t have to have a deep conversation about math, but conversations are a game. There’s a set of rules most people follow in which one person says one thing, the other person follows up and says something else, and the conversation carries on. If the rules of the game aren’t being followed, then I don’t really know what to do. So I move back into small talk. Though most people’s conversations are only small talk, so this tends to be okay. 2)  Asking about anything regarding what I do in math . If this occurs, then I am officially engaged in the conversation. We don’t need to talk about it for that long– I just need to know that the conversational game is being played. If you’re interested about all the various things I can talk about with math, I will happily share all the various things I enjoy thinking about. And if you’re not, then I’ll hit the ball back into your court, asking about your major/interests. 3) Finally, as most “normal” people would expect:  Saying that you hate math .  This  is the most interesting response to me, because I  get it . I usually respond to this sentiment by saying something along the lines of “Honestly, it makes a lot of sense how many people end up hating math as an adult. When did you start to hate math, if you want to talk about it?” And the conversation goes on from there. It’s so interesting to hear people talk about why they rightfully hate something. Maybe they had a terrible middle school teacher who forced them to do a math competition for extra credit, or maybe they just never truly understood fractions. No matter the reason, usually it becomes clear that the reason they hate math was based on something truly out of their control. And I tell them that. I say: “It sucks that your teacher treated you like that” or “So many children unfortunately get left behind once we start talking about fractions.” Saying you hate math requires so much vulnerability, even if it is the social norm. And my job in a conversation is to actively listen and make the other person feel heard, especially if they’re confiding in me/being vulnerable. The last thing that person wants is to hear me boast or make fun of them. This doesn’t mean I can’t talk about why I like math, it just means that I  should  be more cautious . I make sure to emphasize how lucky I was to have teachers who encouraged me, and I share some bad experiences I’ve had in math. I make sure to understand where the other person is coming from, and try my best to leave the other person feeling better about math than they did before the conversation. In this way, I can talk to anyone even if it may be difficult. I’ve found a way to use perseveration to my advantage. Maybe you (dear reader) can use it too. Song:  Hooked on a Feeling , by Blue Suede. Perseveration is when someone gets stuck on a topic or an idea. For me, perseveration comes in a few different forms, from discussing math in various conversations to having an entire blogpost roaming around my head for weeks until I sit down to put it
 
on paper. ⁠ 01 paper? Google docs? I’ll just stick with paper Before MIT, I mostly kept these thoughts to myself. I’d get lost in my thoughts on teaching and math, and tune out the world around me. But I haven’t wanted to do this as much at MIT. Partially because I started
 
blogging, ⁠ 02 ah yes, the captive audience of the world wide web As liberating as this can feel, it comes with a caveat (in my opinion, for all readers but especially MIT students who may happen to read this):  be more cautious . I love how the MIT culture encourages us to talk about our nerdy interests and hobbies, but I wouldn’t be painting the full picture if I didn’t acknowledge that sometimes these conversations can  hurt . MIT students are brilliant, but we aren’t immune to feeling bad about ourselves. In fact, many students  deal with imposter syndrome on a regular basis . And yet, all the time, caution goes out the window as students brag about starting the next problemset early or talk about how easy an ASE (Advanced Standing Exam) is. It’s okay to talk about your interests– you can bring up your interests in any conversation! But there is a fine line between talking about
 
your interests ⁠ 03 especially if your interests are academic Why does this happen? I don’t really know. I mostly attribute these sorts of interactions at MIT to toxic-competition-based high school experiences, but I’m certain there are factors from the institute itself. Whatever the reason may be, I hope with time that more and more students start perseverating with caution. #math analogies #perseveration

Jeremy Song:  burnt espresso : Nearly three years ago, I was writing my college application essays over cups and cups of coffee. After some brutal months of SAT subject tests and trying to figure out how to apply for financial aid, I turned in my applications. Then, I stopped thinking about them. I had turned in what I needed to. My essays were some semblance of who I was, and while I might wish I hadn’t used so many commas in retrospect, I was proud of what I had turned in. Four years of high school effort summarized in various 500 word responses. And thus,
 
I ⁠ 01 perhaps somewhat naively though I think it was for the best 
A short while later, ⁠ 02 arguably much shorter than if I had been actively stressing about the wait just  a moment. I didn’t know what direction my world was going to start moving in next. A few months later, in a
 
fairly active discord channel of 2024’s, ⁠ 03 though no longer quite as lively : Prospective students often ask me to share the most memorable essays I’ve read as an admissions officer. I often reply that the most memorable essays were often unintentionally memorable. I explain that you shouldn’t try to be  memorable  in your college essays; you should try to be  knowable . In other words, while I’m reading your application, you should seem like a real, three-dimensional person—a person I can imagine on our campus. It shouldn’t matter if any particular essay you wrote persists in my memory or not. But while I’m reading your application, I should be able to get to know you, as much as one can know another person mediated through essays, transcripts, and letters of recommendation. In light of COVID-19, the admissions office started experimenting with using Discord to create a space for prefrosh (admitted first-year students) to interact not only with each other, but with MIT upperclassmen, and Institute staff members. We were navigating the exhausting world of “virtual events” and found that the chaotic enthusiasm that Discord allows aligned appropriately with the student community at MIT. I didn’t expect to spend so much time on the 2024 Discord, to be honest—but after many, many late nights/early mornings, it was clear that the platform had consumed me. It became relatively common for prefrosh to ask AOs in the server what we remembered about their applications. (After all, their college application is one of the few things we had in common: they submitted it, and we evaluated it.) Every once in a while—assuming I could actually discern the identity of the user on Discord—I’d share a memory or two from an inquiring applicant. “Didn’t you build that quadcopter for your maker portfolio?” “Are you still running your viral slime Instagram account?” When Paige finally asked, “What do you remember about my application?” I could only really recall two things. “You like math, and you like coffee,” I relayed. “And you’re from somewhere in California.” I was relieved I got it right, and hadn’t
 
mixed Paige up with another student. ⁠ 04 P: though frankly I wouldn’t have blamed Jeremy if he had Paige : I then suggested that we should grab coffee sometime when I got to Cambridge. I had never been to Cambridge before. In fact, when I got accepted into MIT, I remember reading the acceptance letter and thinking to myself “Wait, I thought this school was in Boston, not England.” In any case, Jeremy agreed and said something along the lines of “There are lots of coffee places around to try!”, rattling off a list of two or three. Through this fairly short conversation, my (vague) concept of MIT began to colorize. MIT was no longer just a
 
name or a place, ⁠ 05 that may or may not be in England Coffee was a big part of my high school experience in Fresno, something that Jeremy was able to experience a part of recently. Jeremy : It’s a cruel ritual of adulthood to run into an old friend with whom you’ve lost touch, and exchange a ceremonial “It’s been too long! We should grab dinner sometime soon.” You never actually meet up. Refreshingly, this past summer Paige (who was spending the summer in Cambridge to do some
 
math stuff ⁠ 06 P: an accurate description We met at a local café within walking distance of campus and my home in Cambridge, and caught up over coffee (an iced mocha for Paige, a black cold brew for me). We jumped right into discussing three of the classic themes of the Paige Universe (or Pagi-nation, as she prefers to call it): math education, math research, and writing. As neither a math educator or math researcher, I found myself pleasantly surprised with how well she was able to hold my attention with math content. More than that, I was excited to hear about how well she was doing at MIT, especially given that the first few years of her undergraduate experience were defined by a pandemic. I later shared with Paige that I was planning an upcoming outreach trip on behalf of MIT that would be passing through her hometown of Fresno, California. (I remembered the name of the town, this time.) I explained some of the strategy about my visit: the value of visiting different high schools and colleges, partnering with local college access organizations and community-based youth organizations. “It’s been a few years since MIT has been to Fresno, so it’s time we return in search of the next Paige,” I quipped, only partially joking. Paige :  Over the last ~28 months, I have returned to Fresno exactly twice. Once two summers ago for the entirety of summer doing a remote reading program, and last year for a measly 30 days between spring finals and summer research. Or as Jeremy calls it, math stuff. I love getting a glimpse back into a world I’ve left behind. I mean, I may return one day and settle down, but that’s besides the point. For now, I’m 3000 miles away in Cambridge. And the fact of the matter is, I will likely continue to stay on this side of the world if I attend graduate school. Stopping by Fresno over summer breaks gives me a snapshot of what I’ve missed. Like my favorite coffee shop hiring new baristas, or my high school preparing for the next class of students to arrive (with their corresponding class year becoming way too high for my taste). The world of Fresno was changing, and I wasn’t changing  with it . I was changing  in Cambridge . Even just this summer: I was doing research, and cooking for myself, and learning to be a somewhat functional adult who does math. I was even breaking the cruel ritual of adulthood and actually grabbing coffee with Jeremy. When we met at a local café, Jeremy became three-dimensional to me. Before, he was a 2D blogger avatar with a big smile telling me what all admissions officers (AOs) tell you. Be honest. Be knowable. Be you. To be honest, I thought AOs were being facetious when they said things like this. But after talking about the “Pagi-nation” (lol it’s a stupid name but it is really all encompassing), I understood what he meant. He wanted to know about me, and my experience at MIT.  When Jeremy said he was going to stop by Fresno, I felt like some  narrative arc  had been completed: Fresno. Grow. Coffee. MIT. Grow. Coffee. Repeat. And they say coffee stunts your growth. Jeremy : A few months after grabbing coffee with Paige in Cambridge, I headed to the West Coast for a few weeks of travel on behalf of MIT. After a few days of terrible traffic and terrific food in Los Angeles, I began my pilgrimage through California’s central valley. Traversing several hundred miles of farmland up Highway 99, I finally arrived in Fresno. My first day in Fresno began appropriately with a visit to Paige’s high school, where I gave a brief presentation about MIT to 75 sophomores, juniors, and seniors. It was helpful to have Paige as a recent alumnus to reference, since it offered evidence that students really do get admitted to places like MIT. Chipping away at the mythology of a place like MIT and making it seem real, approachable, and human is one of my biggest goals when I’m traveling on behalf of MIT. After a long day of talking to prospective students at  Paige Memorial High School  (aka Paige’s alma mater), and a few others in the area, I decided to complete the most important mission of the trip: visiting Paige’s favorite hometown coffee shop in Fresno. I made my way down to the Tower District—a hip neighborhood named after the historic art deco Tower Theatre—and grabbed a parking spot next to the famed coffee shop I had heard Paige mention (and write about) on multiple occasions. The café was busy that Friday afternoon, and the staff were friendly and unrushed in a way that seemed characteristic of the Central Valley. I ordered my cold brew and found a cozy spot in an alcove in the back, nestled among a network of sprawling plants, as Beach House played softly in the background. I admit it felt a bit bizarre to have spent the morning at Paige’s school, and later find myself sitting in her favorite café. Admissions officers occupy a strange position: we stand at the threshold of young people’s futures. We are tasked with understanding and interpreting the worlds they come from, the communities they are a part of, and the aspirations that have formed within them. We take what we learn and we do our best to build a team of students who, together, will build a new community on our campus. Some people call us gatekeepers, though I prefer to think of us as bridge-builders. And sitting in that coffee shop that Friday afternoon in Fresno, that bridge felt stronger than ever. #Coffee #waiting

There is   much to say about  residential life at MIT have subcommunities on each floor or hall with rich histories and traditions that motivate a significant population of students to stay in their dorm for all four years of undergrad. At this school, students can have vastly different experiences from their peers who live just fifty feet away. That’s because within dorms, there are many idiosyncrasies that make the undergraduate residential experience so varied. Some dorms are “cook for yourself,” while others mandate that students have a meal plan. Some allow students to paint murals freely, while others limit art or forbid painting altogether. Some permit residents to customize their rooms by building lofts, changing their flooring, and making their own furniture. East Campus and Random Hall also allow cats to wander the halls of floors designated as cat-friendly. With dorms that are so distinct in character, it’s no wonder that students in different spaces have such unique experiences.  Intuitively, the social dynamics within a living space shape how students interact with campus differently; w ill they build strong connections with upperclassmen through their living group, or will they seek this elsewhere, be it through classes or clubs? Will they spend their time after class working with their suite/floor/hall, or will they return to their rooms only at the end of the day, after psetting on campus? Will they party with their living group, at a frat, or not at all? Will they cook or go to dining halls? Will they hang out in lounges, hallways, or rooms?  It’s harder to understand how the physical space of a dorm impacts one’s social life. This is something that’s been on my mind quite a bit ever since I moved back into my dorm, Burton Conner (BC), which was under renovations for the past two years. Although much the renovation was sub-optimal, I’m really happy to have my freshman year home back, and it’s more satisfying than my previous undergrad housing situations (even after ignoring the pandemic’s influence). However, the character of the building has changed, and it’s interesting to think about how student community will change with it. In this post, I want to take a closer look at dorm structure, how it impacts residents, and why it matters so much. Take everything with a grain of salt—these are just my opinions, and even though I’m a senior, I’ve lived in East Campus for a year and BC for even less than that. Everything I’ve heard about other dorms is anecdotal, and people can have vastly different experiences even if they live in the same place! Housing at MIT is continually evolving. When MIT opened in 1865, housing was not provided on campus; students lived at home, in rooming houses, or in
 
frats. ⁠ 01 sig chi is the oldest and was founded in 1882 
Bexley Hall. ⁠ 02 demolished in 2015, RIP It was post WWII that the Institute committed to becoming a  residential campus As the housing system began to develop, MIT would control which students were assigned to which dorm, but student governments started to form their own mechanisms for deciding room assignments within their building. By the late 1960s, every dorm had a room assignment plan—some based on seniority, others based on how long an individual had lived in the residence hall. This priority system made it difficult for large groups of students to move together from dorm to dorm, which motivated students to stay in their assigned hall for their entire time at MIT. It also was one of the factors that enabled the formation of distinct cultures within dorms. https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Baker.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BC-Dirty.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/East-Campus.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MacGregor.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Maseeh.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/McCormick.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/New-House.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/New-Vassar.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Random-Hall.mp4 https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Simmons.mp4 There are a lot of elements to a residential experience that we don’t think about, but were carefully curated by architects to provide a comfortable living environment. A document called  Architectural Principles for MIT Undergraduate Residences — are groups of 30 or so students organized around a Graduate Residence Tutor (GRT) and provided a common space?  — how do students travel from the entrance of the dorm to their rooms? Are they able to interact with others and their environment, walking past community-building spaces and through hallways bustling with activity: students engaged in cooking, music and dance rehearsals, meetings, workouts, and games? Does their path encourage peer-to-peer interaction?  — can students use kitchens as social spaces, cooking and eating meals together? are students able to congregate comfortably in dining halls? is furniture fixed, or can students comfortably reconfigure their space to enable social interaction?  — are floors organized horizontally? do residents have access to all floors via stairways and elevators? does the act of getting from one place to another utilize all aspects of the building structure and environment, increasing usage of central common spaces and fostering a greater sense of community? These aspects aren’t at the top of my head when I walk into my dorm, walk past the laundry room/TV lounge/gym, get to my floor, and walk all the way down the corridor to reach my suite. It’s apparent that the path I take helps me interact with more people; I pass four suites on the way to mine, so I’m able to pop into kitchens and say hi. I walk through my suite kitchen to get to my room, so I almost always bump into a few suite mates whenever I enter and exit. In the renovation, the Burton and Conner sides were connected on each floor. This makes visiting floors on the opposite side of the dorm much easier, and also makes it marginally easier to access certain common spaces. It’s just a few seconds less of walking, but the activation energy is lower, and I’ve been hanging out with people on the Conner side much more than I did in my freshman year. It’s funny to think about how much people bitched about the Burton/Conner connection. Students and alum were livid that the floors were losing their separation, but it actually promotes easier flow through the dorm, which is by no means a negative aspect. What physical structures best cultivate social life? Not high-rises or hallway-style dorms, apparently. According to the architectural principles document, high-rise configurations (like MacGregor) result in a perception of social density. They negatively influence patterns of interaction and sense of community, and increase feelings of isolation. Similarly, residents reported dissatisfaction with long corridors, which feel more crowded and lead to the development of fewer relationships. When I lived in East Campus, which is hallway-style, I felt that it was harder to have casual social interactions. There’s more of a barrier to randomly walking into someone’s open room to say hi than with walking into a suite, so unless you’re good friends with everyone on your hall, it’s harder to initiate new conversations. On the flip side, the two hall lounges are great at facilitating interaction since they’re so open. You have to pass at least one lounge to get to the kitchen, and there’s a decent chance you walk near a lounge every time you have to the leave the building. Being able to see who’s hanging out and when is great. With the dorm Simmons, there’s a common saying: “Simmons residents have more windows than friends.” This is because the dorm is massive, with long hallways that take around two minutes to walk through in their entirety. There are roughly 50 people per floor, but since there are so many singles and bathrooms, the corridor extends the ~400 feet length of the dorm. The structure makes it almost impossible to be friends with every person on your floor, so social culture is instead constructed around lounges. Unlike dorms where incoming residents undergo a floor/hall selection process to choose where they vibe with the most, Simmons residents have “lounge rush,” where they find a friend group and develop their own culture based on their mutual interests. Because of this, the culture is more malleable and based on the vibe of the smaller social units. This appeals to some, but isn’t ideal for those looking to join a larger friend group or a more established community with built-in upperclassman mentorship structures . simmons hall If high-rises and hallway-style dorms are lacking, then what’s the optimal structure? The document asserts it to be “a mix of long and short corridors in a “U-shape” or “double-tower” configuration, with an ideal size of about 350 students, configured in smaller clusters of approximately 30. They would be supported by a faculty head of house, approximately 12 GRTs, one area director (AD), and a house manager in addition to mechanics and custodians.” This is pretty close to Burton Conner, except that Burton-side floors have 44-58 beds and Conner floors have 28-31. I view my social experience as pretty optimal. On the Burton side of BC, there are eight suites, each with its own lounge, as well as a bigger floor lounge. The center suite is more spacious and right next to the floor lounge, so larger social events are split between the two, with people moving from one to the other easily. For giant parties, dorm-wide events, and dance practices, there’s the Porter Room. There also is music practice space, a TV lounge, study rooms, a library, a makerspace, a dance studio, and a gym. the burton-side floorplan (thanks b2!) Within a floor of a dorm, how does the concentration of singles, doubles, triples, and quads affect a student’s experience? Research from the architectural principles document indicates that doubles foster increased relationship building, and that double rooms off a corridor are ideal housing design for first-years. Triples, on the other hand,  “have a tendency to develop into a two versus one scenario” (I disagree). Due to this, MIT’s
 
move to add more beds ⁠ 03 from arch principles--MIT has a goal of adding 700 new beds to the undergraduate housing system; however,<br />
building one large residence hall for all 700 students is neither desirable nor in keeping with the importance of fostering personal ties and building community. From my perspective, if you have too many singles on a floor, then a larger number of underclassmen are more isolated and are less encouraged to build relationships with others. This makes it harder for them to integrate into the community. Conversely, if you don’t have enough singles, then seniors and juniors will feel less inclined to live there, which erodes upperclassmen-underclassmen relationships. Having roommates is an important part of the freshman experience, but it’s critical that things don’t get too isolated. As a freshman, one of my friends lived in a Maseeh quad across from another quad, and the eight of them became a friend group by proximity. Things got a bit dicey since there was no sense of privacy, and the group didn’t feel inclined to befriend other social circles on the floor, which all felt closed off. One such circle would use the lounge, so my friend would instead hang out in one of the two quads, which further separated him from others on the floor. While there’s nothing wrong with this, it’s much more atomized than what I’m used to, and lacks a certain level of upperclassmen mentorship and a greater sense of attachment to and ownership of your space. I can’t imagine my main social group being seven other freshmen who live in two adjacent quads…it sounds hellish. It’s interesting to think about how dynamics shift alongside room compositions. BC has three large suites and five small ones, with the larger ones being more attractive since they’re more spacious and social. Seniors, who are first in the room picking order, usually go for singles in the large suites. However, there are a lot more doubles in the new BC, so there aren’t enough singles in the large suites to fit all the seniors, and we were dispersed throughout the floor as a result. In the pre-renovations BC, the three larger suites were mainly composed of singles. The center suite had six singles and one double, and the other large suites had mostly singles with one double or triple. Now, the center suite has four doubles and three singles, so there’s eight freshmen/sophomores and just three seniors, as opposed to the six upperclassmen and two underclassmen it had in my freshman year. This is both good and bad; when I was a freshman, one of the large suites was notorious for being cliquey since it was home to only seniors and juniors who would isolate themselves. Now that there’s no one suite with mostly seniors, we interact with underclassmen more, which is nice for fostering community and upperclassmen-underclassmen bonds. If you’re the only person in a room and you have psychological and structural ownership of it, then you don’t have to worry about asking anyone else before hosting people. You can cultivate whatever vibe you want without thinking about whether others approve of it. There’s more barriers to doing this when you have roommates. This is why I prefer suite-style living much more than hallway-style. In BC, I have a room, a suite, and a floor lounge. My room is purely my space, and I also have a great deal of creative control and jurisdiction over my suite. The floor lounge is everyone’s to use, but is big enough that I could have a lot of people over in it if I wanted. Like my Maseeh friend, when I lived in EC, I didn’t feel like the main hall lounges were mine to use and would only hang out with people in my room. This made me less social with other people on my hall as a result. Note that I already had an established social group when I lived in EC, and my experience likely would have been different had I been a core member of my floor. How open or closed lounges are also has an effect on what kind of socializing can occur in them. In BC, the floor lounges have doors, so it’s easy to throw loud floor events without being worried about bothering everyone in the vicinity. On the flip side, I’ve heard stories about kids in New Vassar throwing parties in bathrooms since the lounges were too open and exposed to everyone on the floor. I’m not sure how much of that arose from post-pandemic desperation and how much came from a genuine need for a private hosting space. The administration cares less about what you do to shitty, decaying dorms than what you do to freshly-renovated ones…even if the renovations are shoddy and the walls are laden with asbestos and covered with primer, not paint! BC was just renovated, and EC and Random are next on the terrifying, albeit necessary, renovations chopping block. You might think students would celebrate, for example, the addition of an elevator to a five-story building with no air conditioning, but most residents view it as foreboding. In the renovated BC, many amenities were added or
 
updated, ⁠ 04 i'm not going to bother to explain how bad some of the renovations were...the paint is peeling already and the walls break from leaning on them.... Having the ability to interact with my space was an intrinsic part of my living experience. When I painted murals, I felt like I was deepening my connection to my floor and its past generations of students. I cherished being able to express myself artistically in a semi-permanent way within an environment that I love. I also valued living in a space with so many murals since I felt like the community I joined was more tangible, and that I was living in a home and not something more transient. In the new BC, we’re allowed to mount things on specified walls, but we aren’t allowed to paint directly on the walls at all. There are sparse canvas rails where we can hang canvases (once they arrive, god knows when), but the muraling practices of the past are long gone. Having the freedom to experiment and make your space your own has a tremendous impact on your housing experience.  We see this at MIT—generally, t he dorms that permit murals and customization have a greater emphasis on communal living. It makes sense that individuals feel more inclined to participate in communities where they have the power to experiment, shape traditions, and engage creatively with their living spaces.  In dorms where this is not the case (which is most of them), there is a greater barrier to feeling this sense of belonging. This isn’t an issue for the majority of students for a variety of reasons; they may view their living space as more functional than social since they have established social structures elsewhere, or they may experience community without any physical manifestation of it. However, students who view their dorms as an impermanent residence want to invest less time and energy in their living groups. They seek friendships elsewhere, and eventually move away, making it difficult to retain traditions and culture within the dorm. When you already have the capacity to make your space your own, you don’t need to seek a place that meets your needs better. It’s hard to understand the extent of the relationship between self-expression and a sense of community, and there certainly are a myriad of factors at play. As a case study, we look at the last BC renovation: BC’s 1970 renovation In the 1970’s, in an attempt to increase social interaction within residential houses, MIT shifted from corridor-style dorms like East Campus to suite-style ones like MacGregor. This contributed to the need for the large-scale renovation of Old Burton House, which was hallway-style at the time.  The Old BC was in dire need of renewal. According to a  1977 Tech article ,  it was nearly unlivable: …”the plaster flaked, the pipes jutted inconveniently, the carpeting (where it existed) aged ungracefully and when wet smelled dankly of old beer…No one disputed the fact that Burton was ugly, decrepit, institutional and often depressing in its own right.” Thanks to 20 years of water fights and beer blasts, the carpet stank, and the facilities were so awful it was incredible that any student would willingly choose to live there, let alone have any pride in it. From an architect’s point of view, the dorm was not only uncomfortable to live in, but the long hallways limited social interaction and undermined students’ ability to form community. What they didn’t understand is that what the dorm lacked in comfort, it made up in adaptability: students could paint their rooms freely, break walls with hockey pucks, and throw frisbees at the lights.  No one cared what they did since the dorm was so run-down, any further damage was inconsequential. Traditions formed around these events, and eventually, each of the nine floors had its own distinctive characteristics that made Old Burton so appealing to new students. Even though Baker and East Campus had far better facilities at the time, Old Burton remained popular. The addition of better carpeting and lighting—which to us seem like basic necessities—helped convert the rank and moldy hallways to a nicer space where students could gather to talk rather than play hockey or conduct water fights.  This made the dorm more “civilized and quiet,” which was welcomed by some and rejected by others: Not all people want a dormitory they can show off to their parents. Not everyone considers peace and quiet to be of paramount importance. Most importantly, many would dispute the fact that eliminating hall hockey and water fights is ‘increasing the quantity and quality of socializing.’ I have no idea what it was like to live in the dilapidated Old BC, but it’s true that some of my most fun nights as a college student have involved a crazy, spontaneous activity that everyone on my floor participates in. When your space is already damaged and you don’t have to worry about your surroundings, you have more opportunities to do these things. Obviously, it’s not optimal to have such a shitty living environment that no one cares if you punch
 
a hole in the wall, ⁠ 05 especially if the walls have asbestos For example, the decrepit state of the dorm made water fights an important and much-valued tradition. Using fire extinguishers, slingshots, and trash cans full of water eggs, BC residents would wage war against other floors until saturation levels were reached and the smell of old beer would begin to rise out of the carpeting. When the renovation began,   residents had to find other places to live and opted to relocate to houses in Allston rather than being split up across other dorms on campus. The newfound “Burton in Exile”  stuck together throughout the renovation and returned to the dorm in close-knit and rowdy glory, providing the basis for the new BC government and floor cultures. They were among the only students who moved in for the atmosphere of the dorm rather than its rooms, which had become the nicest on campus. Since so many students joined floors that they didn’t feel connected to, what had previously characterized communities began to fade.  In the following years, the floors became quieter with only Burton 1, 3rd, 5, and Conner 3 and 5 representing the Old Burton culture, whereas
 
other floors had homogenized. ⁠ 06 this is interesting to me... things change all the time, but right now the most rowdy floors are Burton 3rd, Conner 2, and Burton 1. When conditions are bad as in the Old Burton, students see a need to pull together to make the place work at all: with luxurious accommodations, they are content to go about their own business…there is no great enthusiasm. A survey released after the renovation illustrated this. 54% of residents viewed the suite as their basic social unit, while only 18% considered it to be their floor. In BC today, there is no “suite culture”—while you might be closer friends with your suite, the smallest social unit is the floor you live on. The fact that only a fifth of residents considered their floor to be their main social group indicates that there were more interactions within suites rather than with an entire floor, unlike what was common in Old Burton. “The physical layout, constrained by the shell of the old building, [worked] against greater unification.” Given that my class of BC residents made it through the renovation and pandemic, I foresee more dorm-wide unification than what existed in the past. But I also see the culture becoming less chaotic and spontaneous since students have less freedom of self expression and more pressure to live within their bounds. BC was a shithole before the renovation, and while the state of the building didn’t create culture, it enabled it in many ways. I’m interested to see how things change now that the building is “new.” The only reason the Old Burton House was tolerated at all was synecdoche—the fact that the experience was an allegory of MIT…the tie that bound [students] was survival, and perhaps a subdued pride therein. For some, life in Burton appealed to a certain latent hippie instinct, for others, it might have been that the comfort was as low as they would ever get. Now, perhaps a new dimension of all that allegory has been added, that follows a pattern of institutional evolution: along with wealth and independence comes departmentalization and isolation. source: the tech Recent trends in student life seem to indicate an administrative preference for an atomized student model, as opposed to the rollercoaster-building, student culture-heavy one that you hear about on tours. Under this model, students go to classes, acquire friends in dining halls and clubs, and hang out with them in various spaces that may or may not include their dorms. They don’t have a group of 30-60 people they’re close to, and friends within their living space are made through common interests rather than a shared sense of community. We see the atomized structure in our ideas of a normal college dorm experience, and also in the real world, where you make new friends through hobbies. Structural interaction within a floor/hall unit, on the other hand, is less commonplace than what we observe elsewhere; this is perhaps why some administrative players are systematically blind to these types of connections within MIT’s social fabric. Although less acknowledged than in Greek life, dorm subcommunities can offer strong support structures. When you hang out with people through the context of a living group, you enable the formation of advice and career networks, and when you neglect this form of collective socialization, you undermine the formation of
 
weak ⁠ 07 aka more informal Housing preferences go beyond your comfort with top-optionality or smoking; they involve how, when, and with whom you want to socialize. Do you want to cultivate more one-on-one friendships or join a collective group? Do you want to retreat to your single at the end of the day to get away from socializing, or come back to 10 people psetting and talking in your suite? With the breadth of residential options MIT has, it’s easy to find a place that meets your needs, but it’s crucial that this range remains in spite of upcoming changes. BC lost a vibrant part of its identity with the whitewashing of our murals, and that’s a blow we’re still reeling from. As renovations of other dorms begin and students have less capacity for customization and experimentation, their relationships with their environments will change—to what extent, I have no idea.

in  cities and ambition , paul graham  writes : “Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder. The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer. What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message there is: you should be smarter. You really should get around to reading all those books you’ve been meaning to. When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.” one of his implications is that if you have an ambition then you should move to a city whose message aligns with that ambition. but what if i don’t? i’ve been thinking about what it would be like to attain any of the most common ambitions people have. do i want to become extremely  wealthy ? i wouldn’t mind, but it’s not a goal that motivates me day in and day out. extremely  smart ? again, i wouldn’t object, but i’ve seen enough smart people dedicate their lives to (in my opinion) inconsequential problems to not be excited by intelligence alone. extremely  influential ? that actually resonates a lot more, but i’ve also realized i care more about doing specific kinds of good for the world than doing the most good possible; that’s why i’m not an effective altruist of course there are many other ambitions – for instance, to be the best possible engineer or artist or mentor or parent. these are all appealing in different ways (except parenting, which i currently have no interest in). but right now i mostly just want to learn a lot and work on meaningful technical projects and make expressive art and be around people i like. what does that say about me? i’m reminded of a  poem  i enjoyed recently: “They aim to build the metaverse, these bright-skinned white-teethed boys. They talk breathlessly of frictionlessness, and I think about your skin against mine, swallow. They carefully enunciate the t in community, and I wonder if they would take my hand if I asked, and march until morning comes, dew-stained cheeks and spent lungs. They dream of a future free of flesh and history. I know that these weights give me form. Am I flawed, that I do not wish to be god, formless light fed through wire? All I pray for in the next world is that you are beside me when I wake…” around two years ago one of my friends asked me:  “are you ambitious?”  i don’t remember my exact response to the question, but i’m pretty sure it was a combination of  “not really”  and asking for clarification on what ambition means. i think that’s what my answer would be today as well here’s what i know: i care about producing good output, which means i spend a lot of time working and trying to develop my skills. i care about growth, which means i spend a lot of time learning new things and meeting new people. but the word  ambition  in its most common usage refers to the desire to achieve a specific goal; dedication to craft and improvement alone usually doesn’t count maybe it’s worth drawing a distinction between  being ambitious  and  having an ambition . in high school i read a  passage  from a harry potter fanfiction that has stuck with me ever since: There was a half-smile on Professor Quirrell’s face as he replied, ‘…for although you are ambitious, you have no ambition.’ ‘That’s not true!’ said Tracey indignantly. ‘And what’s it mean?’ Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had been leaning against the wall. ‘You were Sorted into Slytherin, Miss Davis… but there is no great ambition that you are driven to accomplish… At best you will grasp your way upward into Minister of Magic, or some other high position of unimportance, never breaking the bounds of your existence.’ childhood is laughing at the absurdity of characters like tracey. adulthood is realizing that maybe the idea those characters represent – of wanting to do things well but not having anything specific in mind – is uncomfortably accurate i think it’s wrong to not have an ambition to be more specific, i don’t think your ambition needs to be particularly challenging or impressive, but i think it does need to be specific enough to inform you in making important decisions. in the past two years i have experienced firsthand what it is like to live without an ambition – to constantly suggest new hypotheses and directions and goals only to retract them all a few months later. i don’t think that time was wasted or meaningless, and it allowed me to explore a lot of territory, but ultimately i don’t think it’d be a satisfying way to live the rest of my life hamming  explains  it better than i can: “It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about sqrt(n) steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty gem in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large… a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n). In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.” i’ve spent so long trying to understand my ambitions without ever verbalizing them, and i think that’s been quite harmful because it’s allowed me to avoid specificity. as a result, i think it would be helpful for me to do some brainstorming in public proposal  i want to work on personal projects rebuttal  i think i would feel bad if i spent all my time making personal tools that never saw the light of day proposal  i want to work on projects that reach a lot of people rebuttal  i am not very excited when i look at companies like stripe which are used universally. being the founder of a payments company, regardless of how successful that company is, does not seem that appealing proposal  i want to work on projects that reach a lot of people which i find interesting rebuttal  the usage of the word “interesting” is a cop-out here proposal  i want to work on projects that a lot of people interact directly with. stripe didn’t fit this criteria because most websites use stripe under the hood without explicitly telling the website user what’s going on rebuttal  people interact with walmart pretty directly, and i’m not much more excited by walmart than i am by stripe proposal  i want to work on projects that enable a lot of people to do things which are significantly different from what they would be able to do otherwise. walmart doesn’t count because local grocery stores have always been a reasonable alternative; similarly, online payments existed before stripe rebuttal  that actually sounds like it might be reasonable. but what do “projects” and “a lot of people” and “significantly different” mean? proposal  “projects” means technical projects. “a lot of people” means… actually i’m not sure. i don’t think i want to explicitly maximize number of people reached, since that seems like it could promote working on flashy clickbait projects. i think what i really mean is that i want to reach people outside my immediate surroundings. “significantly different” refers to zero to one moments (creating new experiences instead of incrementally improving existing ones) and the line there is ultimately subjective rebuttal  i don’t think “projects” should actually be limited to technical projects, eg. i’d be happy working on something like crashcourse proposal  yeah, that’s true. i think what i meant was that “projects” should involve skills i’m good at, which traditionally has meant technical projects, but this isn’t a hard requirement rebuttal  this still feels extremely vague. you’ve just described a set of constraints without saying anything about what kinds of problems to solve or what kinds of feelings to inspire in other people. can you be more specific? proposal  i want to inspire joy, wonder, and optimism. actually, i’m not sure about those since i just listed them off the top of my head, let me go consult a  list of feelings  to see if i’m missing anything… yeah okay it looks reasonable. i still don’t know what problems to focus on, but i think i’m happy with trying out several and spending at least a few years on each is this really what i want? it’s always hard to determine whether ideas from brainstorming sessions are good or not, because brainstorming sessions are a somewhat artificial environment. i don’t think i’ll actually be able to tell how accurate what i’ve written above is until i revisit it in a few days or weeks and see what still resonates that’s not really the point of this post though. i’ve been living in generalities for far too long. a specific and flawed answer gives me more to work with than a hazy and spotless one, and ultimately that’s what i need right now

This fall, I enrolled in EM.S21: Design and Make a Lamp. It’s a 3-unit, half-semester class under
 
IDM ⁠ 01 Integrated Design and Management I was thoroughly impressed by everyone’s lamps at the end. This blog covers my design process and experience in the class, then highlights each lamp in the final showcase. Each day featured a new design process, a guest lecturer, and lab time to test out the process for ourselves. The head lecturer, Andy MacInnis, had a lot of woodworking background, and he delivered lectures on joinery, finishing, and casting. For other topics, he brought in various experts: one of the TAs had worked in a 3-D printing company and gave a lecture on the uses and failures of 3-D printing. Another TA had deep knowledge of laser cutters and showed us a lot about 2-D structures in design. Cody from the Hobby Shop came in to walk us through CNC machining, and another guest lecturer showed us CAD modeling. I came in to this class expecting to have a good time but not pick up many new skills, since I already had experience with most of the processes. The class seems to be designed for business and design students, and I was one of few engineers. However, I found that I gained a lot of insight about laser cutting, 3-D printing, and casting. I’d also never CNC machined before. I particularly enjoyed TA Alex Crease’s lecture about design materials and scalability. The course staff were also extremely approachable and patient. Andy let me take the class even though one of my Harvard classes overlapped with a weekly lab, and trusted me to make up lost time outside of class. This project drove home two vital design principles: “Keep it simple, stupid” ~Prof Amos Winter 
“El huevon trabaja doble” ⁠ 02 translation: A lazy person works twice I started with a bold and complicated lamp design. I’m from the Sonoran Desert, have inked desert plants into my skin, and wanted to do something that mirrored desert fauna. prickly pear I like rustic designs that focus on craftsmanship. I’ve done the most work with metal, so while I had some initial thoughts about doing the base of the lamp in wood, I knew I wanted the body to be metal. My first design, Design A, had so many desires: sample hardened resin — fairly translucent, kinda pretty spoiler alert: this was over-ambitious. It looks simple enough, and probably could be done if I had more time; but there were lots of constraints that cropped up. Resin flowers and a metal base: how will you connect them? How will you insert the many lights? Can you design an electrical framework to power the lights, or do you need a bunch of separate plugs? How will you access the wiring within the metal frame? The list of questions went on. I quickly ran into an issue: having too few  design constraints  made it difficult to solidify any part of the project.  I didn’t want to start on the
 
CAD ⁠ 03 computer-aided design I didn’t want to model the flower because I didn’t know what type of light I would use too many unknowns = impossible to start Possible solutions: Choose a few constraints arbitrarily (ie, download light fixture CAD designs) and use those to CAD out the entire design. CAD and laser cut the base structure, forcing yourself to commit, and move from there. personally I think this was the less choice option, however it is the one that I chose. Next time, I will CAD the entire model before making cuts. we ideated first with cardboard — cheaper than steel, faster to cut I knew I needed to test some materials, so in the midst of my design crisis, I whipped up a sample
 
nopal ⁠ 04 Spanish for prickly pear pad 
IDC ⁠ 05 one of my favorite makerspaces! Consider this blog a tour of labs at MIT Then I took the nopal to the Hobby Shop. I had an idea of cutting a nopal-shaped dip into a thick plate of steel, which I would use as a mold to hammer my piece into shape. However, there were no sufficiently hefty steel plates to be found, so instead they directed me to the blacksmithing equipment. I hammered it cold, and learned that doing this was possible, albeit slow. Satisfied that hammering sheet metal wouldn’t be a total disaster, I outlined and cut the base. I had intended to weld the single pieces on to the back of the big pieceTl;dr lights were not meant to happen — I did some experiments with clay, silicon molds, and resin, and realized I would need to invest more time into molding and casting before I could design flowers that satisfied me. But the metal base was going well. I’d cut it in steel, which is stiffer, but easier to weld. I then went to open forge, chucked it in the fire, and hit it with the hammer a lot of times. Cue montage. Previous Next I learned a *lot* about forging sheet metal during this process — namely that it can be quite annoying to work with. Unlike working with thicker pieces, sheet metal deforms quite easily, so you have to be careful not to mess it up and undo your own work. Forge instructors James and Mike kindly let me hang out for several extra hours to get the project done! However, fitting the individual nopales into the big structure wasn’t going swell. The sides deformed more dramatically than the base or top during forging, so nothing fit perfectly. I think this could have been fixed with a mold to hammer into — although I did love the organic, unique shape each nopal took on, so maybe there isn’t need for a fix. I opted to only use the front piece, going for a more simple, polished look. front piece, clamped to the table I decided to go with fairy lights and hot glue them into the holes of the nopales. The hot glue works as a diffuser, and there was just one on/off switch, which was good for simplicity. Next came the base. I had simplified a lot, from removing the resin flowers and spines, to taking away the back; now the lamp was just metal. I had the option of adding a wood base, but at this point I was on a roll with
 
metal. ⁠ 06 also at this point the lamp was due in 16 hours, and I wanted to stick with processes I knew 
on. ⁠ 07 there is welding equipment at Metropolis, but I haven't been welding-certified in that lab yet Previous Next Welding sheet metal onto thicker metal is tricky, because thin metal melts much faster, and it’s easy to burn holes in your glorious new project. I practiced on my prototype pieces, figuring out feeds and speeds. Then I clamped down the actual piece, pulled on my big bulky gloves, set the welder tip an inch from the fairy lights I’d just hot-glued on, then realized my mistake and sighed. Hot glue fumes at 3000 °F might be bad, and starting a fire would be so embarrassing. Fortunately hot glue is forgiving, so I just ripped off the fairy lights and set to welding. Previous Next Welding done, I hot-glued my lights on again, then killed the overhead lights and turned my lamp on. All in all, I enjoyed the process of this lamp quite a bit. I deepened my metallurgy knowledge in forging and welding, since I’d rarely worked with sheet metal. I also re-discovered the joys of hot glue; it’s been a feature of my costumes since. I love how the light reflects off the wall behind the lamp and illuminates its shape. I wish  I had devoted more time to iteration — I feel that more components such as flowers could have been added if I spent more time developing a way to incorporate them with the main structure. I also think I could have incorporated more new skills I’d learned during lectures in this class, rather than sticking with a material I know well. Also, I keep skipping the step of fully CAD modeling my designs. I usually CAD a few core pieces and understand the rest mentally, which usually works but will bite me when my designs get more complex. In this case, I didn’t know how to model the metal distortion that comes with
 
forging, ⁠ 08 or frankly if doing so is possible; the process is fairly organic, and perfectly repeatable only to the very skilled There are about 20 people in the class, and we’d spent the past half-semester designing and working alongside each other. It was joyful to see everyone’s final project and hear about their inspiration and process. CJ used sea glass in resin with a wooden frame and lights around the edges to create a lamp for daughter. He discussed trying to incorporate as many new techniques as he could into the lamp, including joinery, laser-cutting, and resin. Pictured above is a machine in the Hobby Shop for smoothing out wood. Andrea 3-D printed a pokemon lamp in soft blue and white colors; it looked almost squishy, and very cute. Ella designed her lamp to look like the Mostar Bridge from her home country of Bosnia. Gabriel laser-cut the body of this lamp and strung lights inside. Ilani laser-cut a galaxy shape of acrylic and hung 3-D printed stars from it. The lamp hangs from the ceiling. Like CJ, Jason also designed with a particular audience in mind: his 5-year-old son. He talked about the process of interviewing his client to figure out what he wanted, and then the process of trying to make the lamp indestructible enough to survive a 5-year-old. The light saber is 3-D printed and has a light inside. Previous Next Krishna focused on light projection and did a lot of iteration and experimentation about how light would scatter through different cuts of wood. Her peacock feather design is inspired by Krishna the deity, who wears peacock feathers. Lydia focused on simplicity and made a lamp that folds into a box for travel, or unfolds and counter-balances. She used only wood and fabric, and focused on artfully designing the spacing for the fabric and wood pieces; her work has a lovely simplicity. Robin’s lamp is a bouquet with flowers that are connected to a charging port, so you can remove each individual flower depending on how much light you want. You can also pick up the whole bouquet and carry it around like a torch! I saw Robin iterate each piece of the lamp several times; her process was cool to watch. She tried out different cast and 3-D printed designs for flowers, and the bouquet base apparently took several different takes. She bent the wood after boiling it to get a continuous curve. Nearly all of Sarah’s lamp was copper; I loved the look. She talked about the difficulty of working with copper, which work-hardens over time. Sruthi 3-D printed a cactus, then made a resin cast with a hollow inside for the light. She discussed the process of laser-cutting the box sides and ensuring everything fit, as well as her design for hinges. Wells focused on shadows and light, and like Sruthi, did a lot of experimentation with differently sized holes in wood/metal and how point sources of light would play with those holes. He waterjetted a base for a light that threw lines of light and shadow all around itself. Yvette is a photographer, and drew inspiration from photos she took while hiking the Swiss Alps. She made a lamp that played with shadows cast on mountain ranges by 3-D printing a mountain range and designing a light that rotates across the mountains like the movement of the sun. The mountain range is also interchangeable with other mountain ranges. I loved hearing how she used topographical maps to CAD the mountain range in Fusion 360, so her printed mountains are accurate representations of the actual mountain range she hiked. I was so inspired by the range of approaches, from focusing on audience, to trying to use all of the skills we recently learned, to playing with light and shadow. If this class sounds interesting to you, there is a 12-unit version with greater focus on electronics being offered next spring! #Design #making #meche

I hadn’t been sick in  . I mean sure, I’ve had the occasional headache, and yes, there have been days where I just couldn’t bring myself to go to class due to fatigue. But the runny noses, cough drops, and Vicks Vaporub type of sick? Not once in the past ~seven years. Then a few weeks ago, I was out sick with the flu. I frankly don’t know how I had lasted this long at MIT without getting some form of disease. I’m sure part of it was due to the first two semesters being virtual. And sophomore year nearly everyone was careful to stay healthy as best as they could. But regardless of how I avoided the plague for so long, the fact of the matter is that I got it. So what do you do when you’re sick in college? Honestly, I didn’t really know. But here’s what I did. My first plan of attack was to  . I woke up Thursday (10/20) feeling  , opened my Google calendar, saw I had nothing I desperately needed to do that day, and went back to bed. I hoped that I would wake up refreshed and ready to start (and finish) the 7.012 PSET. Instead, I woke up a few hours later practically unable to speak from a sore throat. So, it was onto the next attack:  . This part of being sick sucks, in some ways more than the actual act of being sick. I proceeded to text the various people I had plans with that Thursday and Friday, either rescheduling or simply asking for forgiveness. Everyone was more than understanding, which is a fact I attribute to the MIT’s culture. On the one hand, we all have work we need to do, and the last thing you’d want is to get sick hanging out with a sick friend and be unable to do that work. But on the other (perhaps less selfish) hand, we have all been there. Most students know how frustrating it is to be sick or hosed or generally incapable of doing the things we would much rather being doing, so most students are understanding. After cancelling most plans I was looking forward to, I moved onto the plans that I wasn’t, i.e. the 7.012 PSET. Now off the bat I can’t just excuse this PSET, I don’t have the power to do that. But what I could do was email the instructors of the course and ask for an extension. I did what I could of the problemset, I sent off that email, and went to bed. And fell asleep for sixteen hours. Apparently (I say as I check my email and look at timestamps), the 7.012 staff responded to my email minutes after I sent it and told me to go to S^3, but here I was nearly a full day later after S^3 had closed for the weekend. So I set a reminder to drop by S^3 the following Monday, and   for the weekend with four 28oz fruit punch Gatorades, cherry cough drops, and Chips Ahoy from Verdes. That weekend was the most mind-numbingly boring weekend I have ever had at MIT. It wasn’t like in elementary school where you get the sniffles, skip class, and get a Happy Meal. It was just me in my dorm room, trying my best to stop being sick. I couldn’t even work effectively on problemsets. My brain and body were dead. On Monday, I did what I should’ve done in the first place and  . S^3, aka Student Support Services, is precisely the first place you should go if you start feeling unwell or need help with your classes. The earlier you reach out, the better they can help. For 7.012, this meant excusing my PSET from the previous week (which went terribly, but I expected as much given I did it exhaustedly), and getting a make-up exam for the midterm that Wednesday. For my other, smaller, classes, nothing too much more happened. I reached out to the professors and they were more than accommodating with PSETs and missing class. But still, it helped knowing that an entire student-focused organization was in my corner if I needed help. I also   to rule out COVID, strep, etc., but that’s neither here nor there. The rest of the week, I essentially just stayed in my room until I started feeling better. What else could I really do. I don’t particularly know if there’s too much more to say in this post about that week. In fact, I was debating writing this post in the first place. By the time I got around to actually having the energy to write a post, I was over being sick. I mean, there are so many other cool parts of campus besides me staying in my room all week, many of which I’ve been wanting to write about for the last month. But being “out of business” has played a big role in my semester so far. I still feel behind in a number of classes, and I haven’t been writing as much as I wanted to be. But I’m getting there, and I look forward to sharing

I’ve talked a lot about Tagalog, and Tagalog songs, on the blogs, so it’s a bit of a big deal for me. Colorful on friends / minsan soulsearching / naubos na Rain by any other name 
Filipino ⁠ 01 The difference between Tagalog and Filipino is like the difference between Mandarin and Chinese. The standardized version of Tagalog is Filipino, which in theory includes vocabulary from other Philippine languages, but in practice is more like a synonym for Tagalog. The words mentioned in the post are all Tagalog words, but they're shared between many other Philippine languages, so I think it's more suited to use <em>Filipino</em> here. dear kuya On identity , an acronym for Original Pilipino Music. It’s a catchall term for Philippine pop music, although it’s rather dated. Dissecting emotion on body image It’s cool to care Despite this, I think I   haven’t done enough justice to Tagalog. Especially since I
 
concentrate ⁠ 02 One of the graduation requirements in MIT is the <a href="https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/hass-requirement/hass-concentrations">HASS Concentration</a>, a group of related subjects, like economics, linguistics, history, music, writing.  is the study of a language’s speech sounds—its  —and the patterns in which they appear in a language’s words. This semester, I’m taking 24.901 Introduction to Phonology, so it’s on my mind. In this post, we’ll look at some facts about Tagalog phonology, through the lens of wordplay in Tagalog songs. I mentioned the word  , a language’s speech sounds. But what, exactly, is a phoneme? There’s substance to this question. For example, when do you say two consonants are different? Consider the   sound in the beginning of “pill” and the middle of “spill”. If you’re a native English speaker, and hold your fingertips near your lips and say the two words, you’ll feel an extra release of air for “pill” but not for “spill”. We say these two sounds differ in  . Does the different aspiration make these different phonemes? If the answer was “yes”, consider the fact that, in English, there’s no two words that differ   in aspiration. In fact, a   sound is aspirated only if it’s in the beginning of a stressed syllable. If there isn’t a word that can tell them apart, are they different? What if the answer was “no”? Then consider Thai. The words ปัด “to stir fry” and ผัด “to wipe” are  almost the same  sound with air and the other doesn’t. If there is a word that can tell them apart, are they the same? A pair of words that differs only by a single sound in the same position is called a  . In Thai, we have a minimal pair for aspiration, so we can call those different phonemes. In English, we don’t, so we shouldn’t count them as different phonemes. By using minimal pairs, we can count the number of consonants and vowels in a language. An excellent resource called  WALS the vowels There’s some  correlations For example,
 Munimuni’s “Tahanan” ⁠ 03 All song links go to YouTube, at the beginning of the excerpted part. Here, we get the minimal pair   and  . This is a bit hard to translate. A literal translation, that preserves   of the tone, would be: It ends here 
Your tears 
Please, stop 
Stop crying The actual tone is more sweet, like a parent hushing their crying child. The verb   is also a
 ⁠ 04 The phrase <em>near-minimal pair</em> isn't well-defined.  “home”, the title of the song. Near-minimal pairs are more common, and can also sound nice together. As another example, consider another song from Munimuni,  “Bukas Makalawa” Literally: Soon 
I want to get away soon 
From the memorized scene 
I want to get away soon Notice that the near-minimal pairs here aren’t   rhymes, which are a pair of words whose phonemes are the same after the stressed vowel. In both   and   the stressed syllable is the second one. It’s technically an  imperfect rhyme The word   means “twice”, but it’s often used to mean “the day after tomorrow”. The phrase   is idiomatic, often meaning “soon”. And   means “to get away”, formed from the prefix   “the ability to” and   “nothing”. Again,   is an idiomatic word. As an example not from
 
Munimuni, ⁠ 05 Munimuni is a band that uses a lot of idiomatic Tagalog, which is part of why I love them! But I want to use a variety of sources. Moira Dela Torre’s “Titibo-tibo” This is an interesting one to translate.   is slang for “lesbian”, but in this context,   means something like “to act boyishly”. In a Philippine context, sexuality and gender expression are more closely bound than in the US. The word   “gay” carries a connotation of acting effeminate, and   is derived from  , which carries a connotation of acting masculine. The noun   means “heartbeat”. It figuratively carries the same connotation as in English; the heart is the center of emotions, so   also refers to one’s feelings. Even if I act boyishly 
My heart still beats for you The words   and   are formed in the same way: repeating the first syllable of the word, then repeating the word. This turns a noun to a verb related to the noun. In linguistics, repeating a word is called  While
 
some English words ⁠ 06 Think <em>no-no</em>, <em>zig-zag</em>, or <em>fifty-fifty</em>.  in English. That means we can’t generalize the reduplication to new words. If I invented a new verb, like to  , it’s unlikely that you can reduplicate it to mean something. Compared to Tagalog, where reduplication   productive: if   was a verb,   would be its present tense. I bring up reduplication because it’s a pretty common phenomenon across languages; see the  WALS map  English is! We now move onto  , something that makes a syllable more emphasized. Changing the stress in a word can be a form of wordplay, as in TV Tropes’s  AcCENT upon the Wrong SylLABle In English, the words   and   differ only in where the stress is. I’m not aware of many cases in English where this distinction is used for wordplay, though. In Tagalog, I can think of at least two, both from songs. The first one is from  Cheats’s “Tawid” Here,   and   contrast only in stress. The first,  , has stress on the first syllable, and comes from   “hope”, and   “that (thing)”. The second,  , means something like “practice” or “experience”. Its stress is on the second syllable. It’s formed from   “experienced”, and  , a suffix turning an adjective to a noun. Hope you realize that 
Delivery is all about practice Unlike English, Tagalog has mostly  . That means that “most” words have stress in a predictable place. In Tagalog, most words have stress on the penultimate syllable, the syllable that’s the second from the end, although there are many exceptions. Of
 
languages that have stress, ⁠ 07 Not all languages have stress. Most examples of languages without stress come from tonal languages. half have fixed stress Although Tagalog has fixed  , many words have  , which can distinguish words that are otherwise identical. Primary stress refers to the main stress of the root, while secondary stress is any other nonprimary stress. In English,   has primary stress at the fourth syllable, and secondary stress on the second syllable. Stress patterns across languages share some surprising similarities. A common pattern is preventing  , which is when
 
two consecutive syllables ⁠ 08 A saying in linguistics is that "phonology cannot count past two." The claim is <a href="https://radical.cnrs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Paster2019_FINAL.pdf">disputed</a>, but it sure feels like it’s true. , which is when two consecutive syllables are both unstressed. It’s generally true that languages prevent clash and lapse. The word  , for example, has neither clash nor lapse. The full story  is a bit more complicated In Tagalog, however,  it’s not clear 
secondary stress is predictable. ⁠ 09 There are certainly patterns in Tagalog secondary stress. Like English, Tagalog has <a href="https://wals.info/chapter/17">trochaic rhythm</a>, for example.  “container” and   “will place (in something)”. These both have primary stress on the last syllable, but the latter has secondary stress on the first syllable. This brings us to our next example,  Coeli’s “Magkaibigan o Magka-ibigan” The first word,   “to be friends”, has primary stress on the fourth syllable. The second word,   “to be lovers”, has primary stress on the last syllable, and secondary stress on the second syllable. Friends or lovers? 
Which of the two, really? Both   and   have lapse, but the first one has two cases of lapse, while the second only has one. Counting violations is a tenet of  optimality theory Another thing that makes languages sound different, apart from having different consonants and vowels, is how those come together to form syllables. If you listen to  Hindi sapat ang sampung libong kilometro I’m not talking about the ratio of the total number of consonants and vowels there are in the language, something WALS calls the
 consonant–vowel ratio ⁠ 10 As mentioned earlier, English has around 24 consonants and 12 vowels, for a ratio of around 2, while Tagalog has around 16 consonants and 5 vowels, for a ratio of around 3. Even if we don’t have the statistics for this, we know something related: the   of each language. Speech, after all, is composed of syllables. If we can study the consonants and vowels in a syllable, it’s like studying the consonants and vowels of speech in general. By   being a CVC syllable, for consonant-vowel-consonant. In Tagalog, syllables are
 
either CV or CVC. ⁠ 11 Caveats. Sometimes you have CCVC, like <em>buwan</em> "month", which is sometimes pronounced without the <em>u</em> sound, but the root form is still CVCVC. Loanwords also have more complex syllable structures, like the direct borrowing <em>charge</em>, which is CCVCC. . This difference in syllable structure makes some forms of wordplay easier in English than Tagalog, or vice-versa. English poets sometimes use  , which is repetition of similar consonant sounds. The first two lines of  William Blake’s “The Tyger”  sounds. Consonance is less common in Tagalog, where  , the repetition of vowel sounds, is more common. English has some examples, like in “the squeaky wheel gets the grease”, but they’re less common and often subtler. It kinda makes sense, then, that as Tagalog has more vowels, it’d be more common to have wordplay surrounding vowels. Let’s look at two examples, both from Autotelic. The first is from  “Laro” Here we have some strong assonance, with two words sharing a decent number of sounds. The most common sound in Tagalog is the   sound, by far, so it’s not too surprising that’s what we see here. The root words here are   “cheat” and   “can”, leading to   “to cheat (at something)” and   “to be able to (do something)”. The reduplication puts it in the future tense, giving us: Cheat 
I’ll cheat 
Be able to 
I’ll be able to The second example’s from  “Languyin” Note how, in the pre-chorus, we have   and  , which have similar vowels and stress patterns, with only minor differences in consonants. The chorus contrasts   and  , which have a similar relationship, and less closely   and  . To take a stab at translating: Throw my world upside-down 
You’ll return again and again 
Won’t run out of wind and ways Waves may swallow me 
I’m ready 
To swim, to swim 
Winds may sweep me away 
Or get me lost, but I’m ready 
To travel, to travel All the phonology’s real, but I wouldn’t take any of the analysis too seriously. Here’s a Spotify playlist: Go study linguistics, kids!

Last spring, I took CMS.614, Network Cultures, taught by Petey. It’s one of my favorite classes I’ve ever taken at MIT (even though I had to drop it 3/4ths of the way through the semester). One of the assignments for that class was to  “Make An Agent.” We had the choice to make either some social bot, tool, or dataset + visualization for the project. I opted for a dataset + viz. The semester prior (Fall 2021), I had
 
dormspammed ⁠ 01 To send an email out to all of the dorm mailing lists on campus The survey the bathroom’s location and gender, and also asked submitters to rate the following attributes on a scale of 1-5: I also asked if there were a full mirror in the bathroom and any comments they may have. I kept the survey open for about three days and I received about 81 responses. I manually added each submission’s latitudes and longitudes and added it into the data so I could easily put them into the interactive map. Once I gathered those results, I separated them into “favorites” and “least favorites” and downloaded them into their respective .csv files and created a script to parse out the data into a JSON format. (The script was aptly called “poop_parser.py”.) Originally, the website was built using the Google Maps API, but Google recently started charging to use their API so I switched to a free alternative, OpenStreetMap, using react-leaflet, a Javascript React library for interactive maps. Then, I took each entry in the list, grouped them by common location, and averaged the results and entered them into the map to create my poop map! You can find my  Poop Map here Through this map, you can click on the little poops to see people’s responses. Happy poops indicate people’s favorites and sad poops are people’s least favorites. At the top of each poop entry is the averaged ratings and if you scroll you can find the individual ones. Some interesting tidbits: This was kind of just a fun throwaway project I did to learn React and Typescript better, so it’s definitely not the most sophisticated. If I were to continue with this project, I’d probably look into a database of some kind (maybe I can finally learn Firebase) so people can submit updates to their favorite bathrooms. This would be done through some Touchstone verification (ensuring they’re an MIT student) to prevent spam. I would also probably add some way to filter bathrooms based on gender or rating and things like that. If you’re interested in looking at the code, you can find the  GitHub repo here

In my  last blog post Now that I Live In A Place TM, I have a Local Community TM. Admittedly I only lived 15 minutes away from here when I lived on campus, so really this used to be my local community too, but it feels a lot different when it’s right on my doorstep. Along with my friends and my roommates, I’ve been on a mission to actually try all the cool places I live so close to! We’ve seen a live music show at the Middle East, tasted a cider flight at the Artifact Cider Project, and tried out several new restaurants. (My fave is Rangzen Tibetan, if anyone local wants to know :) It’s a bit embarrassing how much cool stuff we lived so close to without ever really realizing it, but it’s super fun to get to take advantage of it all now. It’s pretty common around here for people to use our October long weekend (Indigenous People’s Day) to go camping – it’s late enough in the season that the trees are usually beautiful colors, but not so late that you freeze your whole butt off. So a few of my friends and I went camping and only froze half our butts off! We went to Wompatuck State Park, which I’d never visited before, for the primary reason that it was a nice-looking park that you could get to on the T, therefore saving us from having to pay for a rental car. The park was indeed beautiful and we had a lovely time going on hikes and cooking over the fire. (And dropping food into the fire, and fishing food out of the fire…) Previous Next I took up poi spinning as a hobby over the summer as something to do when I was alone in my little New York apartment. I really liked it and I’ve been keeping it up with it during the semester, although my rate of picking up new tricks has definitely slowed 😅 Our Spinning Arts club usually hosts one spinjam (lots of people all spinning different props and teaching and learning from each other) and one firejam (spinning on fire, which requires more safety protocols and fewer people spinning at once) per week, and I’ve been able to make it to a lot of them so far. I’m just now starting to get to the point where I know enough tricks that I don’t have to just practice one particular trick over and over, but I can instead just put together whatever feels right, a.k.a. “flowing”. It’s really fun to just put on some music and move with it! Previous Next Last semester  I took the beginner glassblowing class It’s a bit of a tradition in East Campus, and therefore among East Campus
 
cruft, ⁠ 01 alumni Last weekend my roommates and I went apple picking! We went to Honey Pot Hill (at a very cheap price thanks to subsidies from the Graduate Student Council) and the weather was absolutely perfect. We walked around picking up apples, taste-testing different varieties, and laughing and hanging out in the sun. It was one of those days that’s perfect just because it is. I can’t justify just why it should be so beautifully satisfying to be walking through an orchard on a crisp sunny day with the people you love – it’s obvious and yet also inexplicable. It was a good reminder of how joyful life can be. Previous Next Scheduling and then doing a specific fun activity is great, but it also feels amazing to be able to do something on a whim, just because I want to and because I can. I coded up a little web app when I had a fun idea for an app; I play board games with my roommates and we’re partway through a puzzle right now. I baked a cake on a school night. I signed up for a LARP just because I’d never tried one and I was curious. For all of undergrad, I was always running short on time, having to save it and budget it and allocate it so carefully. If I budgeted well enough, occasionally I could spend a little time on fun. But now I have enough extra time that I can afford to spend it on a whim, without triple-checking my calculations and worrying over whether it will all balance out. It feels like freedom. It feels really good. Just a picture I took and liked :)

Black Panther 2  comes out this Friday, and everyone and their dog seems to have tickets to see the film when it premieres. Before you ask, no, I am not one of those people. Not just because I’m busy and generally dislike superhero movies, but because I know exactly what will happen in the film. That’s right – after running several concurrent simulations on an MIT-inspired neural network (i.e. after thinking about it for a few seconds in my brain), I deduced the entire plot of the film correctly days before it premieres. After all, when has someone on the internet ever been wrong about something like this? What I know so far I’m not the biggest Marvel fan, but I still know a few things about what has been revealed to us so far (mostly from watching out-of-context trailer clips and hearing rumours from my friends). In particular: Simmons (my dorm at MIT) will appear in a few scenes. There will be some car chase on the Harvard bridge. T’Challa won’t feature much in this film (because Chadwick Boseman died 🙁). Ironheart/Riri Williams will be involved in the plot somehow. Fish people(?) This information may seem like not a lot to work off of, but I assure you that it’s more than enough to infer a cohesive plot with near certainty. Without further ado… What will most definitely happen The film starts with T’Challa walking with a group of reporters along a concrete bridge in Wakanda, recapping the events of the first  Black Panther  film. Suddenly, the bridge collapses, killing everyone. This event shocks and confuses Wakanda, but the cause of the collapse quickly becomes apparent – centuries of isolation had left the nation in the dust in terms of concrete technology! (At that point in the film, they’re about on par with the ancient Romans.) Furthermore, it’s becoming increasingly evident that their overreliance on vibranium – a rare and non-renewable resource – is hopelessly unsustainable. In fact, the carbon emissions and runoff pollution from their mining operations cause the king of the oceans to attack Wakanda in a desperate bid to slow down climate change. Wakanda at the end of the first film. Note the structural instabilities due to a lack of concrete Clearly, Wakanda needs an infrastructure overhaul. These incidents inspire Shuri to pursue her repressed passion for architecture and civil engineering to prevent such tragedies from happening again. And where better to study architecture than at the first architecture college in the US? At MIT, she chooses to live in Simmons because of its striking design and gravity-defying overhangs. What Shuri thinks when she first sees Simmons There, she meets Riri “Ironheart” Williams, a fellow first-year student wanting to study metallurgy at MIT (hence her name). Through Riri, Shuri learns that the dorm’s funky shape is possible thanks to reinforced concrete – concrete embedded with steel bars and wires. While Riri excitedly explains how the hybrid composition of reinforced concrete combines the best of steel and regular concrete, Shuri silently hatches a plot to take Riri and her seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of composite materials to Wakanda, whether she wants to or not. This then leads to the famous scene showing the interior of a Simmons dorm room, which transitions to a car chase on the Harvard bridge. Although the trailers made these two scenes look like action sequences, they’re actually both part of a five-minute-long educational segment about how modern engineering techniques have vastly improved the safety of the bridge throughout its 131-year life. The sequence ends with a handy diagram showing the types of bridges (and helpfully points out that the Harvard bridge is a steel haunched girder bridge) Fortunately, Shuri realizes that learning from and collaborating with Riri at MIT would be far more effective than her original plan, so she calls off the chase and the two reconcile. A few days later, they even become roommates in Simmons! A montage of Shuri doing stereotypical MIT student things then plays as she narrates her MIT undergrad experience. Along the way, she finds a
 
UROP ⁠ 01 Undergraduate research opportunity Finally, ultra-reinforced concrete (which conveniently has every material property we want because the plot requires it) Flash forward a few years, and we see how this marvellous invention has impacted the world. Shuri and Riri had created a startup – Black Panther Industries (named after the late T’Challa) – specializing in next-generation construction services, which quickly became one of the most valuable companies in the world. Thanks to them, Wakanda is now a hub of engineering excellence and, more importantly, sustainability (a subtle nod to the subtitle  Wakanda Forever ). This is what Wakanda looks like now (could you tell which dorm Shuri and Riri lived in?) The movie then ends with the pair gazing wistfully into a Wakandan sunset as  Concrete Jungle  by Bob Marley plays in the background, and the credits start to roll. (Naturally, there’s a post-credits scene – this time about Ant-Man discovering that transmission electron microscopy can accelerate the development of the nanotechnology powering his suit.) #Black Panther #Simmons Hall

Near the start of the pandemic, I decided not to come back to MIT full-time during fall 2020, since I knew I wouldn’t get that much out of Zoom University. Instead, I chose to work. Unfortunately, nobody was hiring at the time. After throwing my resume at company after company, I finally received an interview from a small start-up. The interview went fine until, at the end, one of the founders asked me how much compensation I was expecting. “Um . . .” I wavered. I hadn’t prepared for this question. Panicking, I said the first number that came to mind. “Okay,” she said. A day later, I received an offer from the company. It was a little less than the number I had proposed.  I thought.  . The suggestion I had given was too low for my qualifications, but I was scared I wouldn’t be able to get a job at all. So despite my reservations—I thought it was bad form for them to ask me how much I wanted to get paid, then offer me less than that—I accepted the offer. There were a few giant red flags on the first day. I won’t go into all of them as to not give away any identifying information about this company, but here was a deal-breaker: I went to the orientation meeting, only to sit in an empty Zoom room for thirty minutes; during this time, I sent several emails, bumping the founders (“Hey! I’m in the Zoom.” “Hey! Let me know if a better time works.”) to no avail. Eventually, I left, and one of the founders emailed an apology several hours later. I realized that this company was not going to provide me the growth and learning that I wanted, and that if the founders couldn’t respect my time, then it wasn’t worth staying. If I had been younger, I might’ve stuck it out for the pay: in high school, I did plenty of miserable jobs. But now I wanted to value my own time and skillset more.  , I told myself.  So the next day, I emailed the founders saying I was sorry but this wasn’t the right fit. One of the founders removed me from the Slack, GitHub, etc. without even responding to my email. That confirmed to me that this wasn’t going to be a great place to work. When I tell people this story, they often react with surprise that I left so early. But why not cut my losses early? I trusted my judgment, and I have never regretted leaving; later on, I saw that one of the founders departed from the company under tense circumstances. I try to apply this philosophy to most things I do.  or step away from a situation as soon as it’s not serving me anymore. Sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy, after all. The first week of school, I go to many classes and drop them quickly. If I buy junk food and I’m not enjoying it, I toss it in the trash because then there’s no benefit to continue eating it. A few months ago, my friends and I went to a yacht party, but the vibes were clearly off, so we left the boat before it disembarked and we would’ve been trapped. Obviously, all these decisions can only be made if I have the privilege of stepping aside, and to be honest, that might be the difference between me now and me as a high school student. I didn’t enjoy all the minimum-wage jobs I worked, but it wasn’t like I had many employment options at age fifteen. If I buy a boba now and don’t like it, it only costs a fraction of what I make in an hour; back then, if I bought a boba and didn’t like it, well, that was an entire hour’s worth of work, and was I really going to throw that away? I’m grateful that my circumstances have shifted, that I’m able to walk away from many things now. This also isn’t to say that committing isn’t important. I’ve been at my living group for six semesters. I dated the same person for three years. There is a difference between leaving something that is a net negative and leaving something because the grass might be greener elsewhere. If I’m happy, then there’s no need to search elsewhere. The key is to notice my unhappiness as early as possible and take steps to mitigate it, even if those steps are drastic, such as quitting an internship on the second day.

I’m taking
 
CMS.586 ⁠ 01 Introduction to Education I went to an evangelical Christian school for middle and high school. I have not been in a public school in almost a decade. I feel like I have been sent to Mars. For one, people at my school had a lot more of a fear of God in them — both metaphorical and literal. I’ve never been in a classroom where students would get up and walk around, or openly be on their phones during class, or talk to their friends. I don’t really know how I feel about this. I had a hard time sitting down in school, so I would’ve loved a little less rigid of a classroom setting; at the same time, I don’t know how much chaos is too much chaos. It’s also considerably louder than I’m used to. I’ve been hiding earplugs underneath my hair, and it occurs to me that being able to casually make my environment work for me was not something I had the power to do as a child. In the physics class I observe, there are some students who are really really quiet, and I sometimes wonder if the more-chaotic environment hinders their ability to learn. I don’t know what CCCS’s  IEP/504 Both the physics teacher and the algebra teacher I observe have a lot of energy, and that seems to really resonate with their students. Unfortunately, I’m a pretty quiet person when I’m in an unfamiliar setting. I wonder if I can buy a “Confident Teacher” costume off of Amazon or something, because I’m going to need a lot more practice on projecting my voice across a room. Or maybe on talking louder than about 40 dB. CCCS also has a considerably higher percentage of Black students than my school did, and this is the first time that I’ve felt very aware that I did not share the same experiences as most of the people around me. Sure, I didn’t really relate to my affluent White classmates in high school either, but I also didn’t really interact with them — and the same strategy is not exactly conducive to becoming a good teacher. I don’t really want to teach in a saviouristic way, and I become a little more hesitant and a little less confident as a result. Thankfully for me, both classes I observe do a lot of work in small groups, and both teachers often walk around to talk to students one-on-one. This is something I’m used to from TAing 8.02, and I really enjoy being able to meet students where they’re at in terms of the content. Sometimes it’s still a little awkward to get students to talk to me, but this is understandable — it took me two years of MIT to start going to office hours specifically to ask for help on my psets rather than going   I’d bashed out the entire pset on my own. I don’t know how to make it easier to ask for help, either at CCCS or in 8.02, and I wish I did. In one physics class, a student asked questions far beyond the assigned worksheet, and it made me really happy that the teacher not only answered her question but gave her more to think about right back. It reminded me of my AP Calculus teacher, who allowed us to use shortcuts as long as we wrote a proof and taught it to the class first, and I’m glad that something I loved about my own education survives across vastly different schools. My high school physics teacher visited me a couple weeks back, and I had started talking to his wife — who teaches middle school algebra — then. “It’s very different,” she told me, “Joel has a whole class full of motivated students like you, who don’t need any convincing to learn.” It’s true that the students in the physics class I observe get “stuck” and start asking for help much faster than I did in high school, but I wonder how much of it is an inherent difference in motivation and how much of it is an internalized belief that they aren’t smart enough or a fear that they’ll get it wrong. I don’t really know how to convince them that it’s okay to scribble down whatever thoughts they have because being wrong is informative all on its own, and I don’t know if it’s my place to do so either. There’s a lot of emphasis on being prepared for the  MCAS exam Sometimes I’m uncomfortably aware that — simply by being an MIT student — people see me as a very successful outcome of the education system, and my thoughts on education are probably rooted in the same premise that it would be good to encourage more students to become like me. There’s also the aspect of knowing that I grew up being told that education was for me, that college was for me, that I was “smart” and it would be a pity if I didn’t get to use my brain as much as I wanted to — and this is almost certainly not the same kind of messaging that many students, especially those in underrepresented groups, get as they grow up. There’s also the knowledge that I also grew up financially stable enough to be able to view education as something I can do for fun, and I don’t think it’s necessarily wrong to view education as a means to a good job and a stable salary rather than something to enjoy. I don’t think that being like me — like people I know at MIT — is the only way to benefit from education. MIT certainly hasn’t made me more interesting as a person — I’m pretty sure people who don’t go to MIT, or college at all, have equally rich inner lives. And so I don’t know what to encourage students to be “more like”, because I don’t know where they’re coming from or where they want to go. I don’t know how to say that I want to learn how to teach in a way that works for them, and that I don’t want to swoop in to make them fulfill the textbook definition of successful teaching. I wish I could tell them that I genuinely think they are just as capable as I am, and I wish I could sit down to ask them about their lives and their thoughts, and I wish I knew I could possibly do to help them become who they want to be #MIT Teaching Systems Lab

eulogies are beautiful but  can we talk about leaves before fall? this time, i’ll make the summer count  this time, i’ll be louder  today, i feel like a leaf rustling impatiently behind far gone cars it must be that cars run on wind,  i don’t know any other way i look smaller in all the mirrors  that make you better  if i had tires, i wouldn’t have to walk with broken feet  i should’ve been better. Growing up in a place where I did not have many opportunities to pursue the things I was interested in, I feel very grateful to be at MIT. If there is something you want to do, there is always some way to do it. There are classes of all varieties from bookmaking to glassblowing and psycholinguistics to creative computation. There are clubs for dance and music and theater and math and sports and everything else. Through the Council for the Arts at MIT, you can get free or discounted entry to
 
the MFA, ⁠ 01 the Museum of Fine Arts 
the ICA, ⁠ 02 the Institute of Contemporary Arts 
the BSO, ⁠ 03 the Boston Symphony Orchestra 
The UA ⁠ 04 the Undergraduate Association. it is a student government body that deals with a lot of different aspects of the undergraduate life. 
UROPs ⁠ 05 Undergraduate Research Opportunities As a naive first year, this variety of opportunities made me question whether it makes up for the lack of opportunities before. I thought I needed to take advantage of every opportunity available to me, otherwise I would be wasting my time here. I would be wasting the one opportunity that was provided to me. I saw people from vastly different backgrounds than mine and I saw them excelling at things I struggled deeply with. I felt like I was falling behind.  There seemed to be only one thing to do: catch up. I needed to bridge the gap that was created by a lifetime of disadvantage and I needed to do it as fast as possible.
 06 if that sounds absurd, that is because it is. Throughout my first year at MIT, I felt the compulsive need to catch up. I felt I needed to be like everyone else. This, in itself, is an odd thing to say given that there is no label that could fit the entire MIT population. Every person has a completely different pre-MIT story and a wildly different MIT experience.  I guess, what I mean is, when I see other people in classes who have seen some of the content before, on day 1, I already feel behind. Even if that is not the entire class, those few people feel the most prominent. When I work on problem sets with friends who seem to be getting to the solutions while I am still struggling to understand the problem, I feel like I would do anything to change that. to just be better.  I don’t know how to achieve that or how to get to a point where I know how to approach problems and gain intuition for finding the solutions. Sometimes, I have a vague idea of why the statement is true and how the proof works but it feels infinitely difficult to phrase and connect everything. Other times, I just don’t know.   One of the hardest things to navigate at MIT is how to carve your own MIT experience without thinking about what other people around you are doing. Comparison is bad because everything that matters is in a blind spot and you compare just the shallow reflection of a present. Just because we all ended up at MIT does not mean we are the same and it’s funny how easy it is to overlook a lifetime of differences for
 
a couple months ⁠ 07 or a year now, I guess The other thing is that after talking to a lot of different people all doing different things, I would feel that I needed to be doing all those different things that I heard five different people talk about.

so deeply exhausting ⁠ 08 and extremely unhealthy It is so unfair to expect to undo your entire life to become someone else. I have realized, if not internalized, that it is impossible to completely level ground with 19 years of
 
privilege ⁠ 09 i am generally good with spellings so i think it is very ironic that i always have to rely on my auto-correct to know how to spell privelege, i mean, privilege. In Jane Wong’s book “How to not be afraid of everything,” she beautifully talks about her past and how she co-exists with it. In the poem ‘Lessons on Lessening,’ she says: It feels that the societal expectation is that the insects should come back to life. If they don’t, they were too weak to begin with. It was inherently their fault to not have survived when there are other alive creatures out there. It is hard to believe that the key difference, the fact that some of these creatures were frozen and others were not, shrivels quietly in a blind spot. There is some unsaid expectation when it comes to members of disadvantaged groups that you have to do something big to be worth anything. You need to be more. If you just exist and try the normal amount, it is not enough. Because you struggle more, you must struggle more. You must be stronger or you were too weak.  If I burn myself out in the first couple of years of college, that just means I won’t be able to make use of all the future opportunities that I would’ve been more prepared for if I knew how to calibrate my expectations better. If I ruin my physical and mental health trying to catch up to some made up standard of who I am supposed to be, I will end up apathetic and unmotivated, and I have already started to feel a lot of that.  There are no glass shattering conclusions here. It’s simple, really. You are not responsible for the lack of privilege in your life and you are not responsible for making up for it in any amount of time. You are allowed to exist, trying just the right amount and that would be enough.  You are allowed to exist.

The other day I fell asleep watching Hermitcraft videos on Youtube, which is how you know I’m well and truly exhausted. Normally, playing and/or watching people play Minecraft is a hyperfixation that can consume my attention for hours on end.  That being said, my favorite Hermitcrafter is  Zedaph While I won’t be dying to zombified piglins or getting struck by lightning (I hope), putting my goals for the year into a game-like format makes them seem more fun and doable. CATEGORY ONE: GETTING MY LIFE TOGETHER I’ve been taught the importance of setting goals with specific, quantifiable results since as early as elementary school. Unfortunately, it wasn’t drilled into our heads enough, because neither my two closest elementary school friends nor I can remember the silly acronym that was once plastered on every white brick wall – STAR? SHARE? START? Something That’s Actually Reasonable Sounding? – to subliminally imprint the importance of goals in our young, impressionable minds. Just for this, though, I’ll try to recall what I learned. 1. Caves & Cliffs: be able to do a pull-up I have a somewhat irrational fear of the hypothetical scenario in which I’m hanging off the edge of a cliff, tall enough that I wouldn’t be able to sustain the fall damage, and I’m scrambling, clambering, struggling to pull myself to safety because my weak little biceps and back muscles can’t complete a chin-up.  Silly as that may sound, it’s the reason I’ve been doing some short workouts on days when I have an hour-long void in my schedule or when I don’t have club badminton practice. But every day, regardless of how busy or exhausted I am, I make at least one chin-up attempt. Whether that means sneaking one in at the Next House gym before eating dinner, or at 2am, when the Burton Conner has a frankly absurd amount of people using it (as  Vincent H. ’23 2. A Balanced Diet: learn how to cook For someone living in a
 
cook-for-yourself dorm ⁠ 01 residence halls without dining halls that don't require you to have meal plans, i.e. Burton Conner, East Campus, MacGregor, New House, and Random Hall. 
4.021 ⁠ 02 Design Studio: How To Design, a class that covers the fundamentals of, you guessed it, design. It takes place in MIT building N52, which is on Mass Ave and a short walk away from Central Square. 
Teresa’s Patented Best Breakfast Sandwich Ever, ⁠ 03 smoked salmon, prosciutto, sliced cucumbers, and scallion cream cheese on a toasted everything bagel, aka the only thing waking me up in the mornings. 
Haribo gummy bears, ⁠ 04 that my friends and I somehow manage to consume in a single sitting 3. Take Inventory: be organized Ironically, this is the least structured goal of mine. Every time I’m inevitably hit with the urge to organize my entire life top to bottom at some ungodly time of night, I never quite know what “being organized” means or entails. It could be described by smaller, more manageable tasks like folding my laundry as soon as I take it out of the dryer, or decluttering my Outlook inbox or the files on my laptop every so often. It might mean finally centralizing all of my to-do lists and ideas on one Notion page instead of haphazardly scribbling on post-its or setting random reminders on my phone. Who knows? As it stands, though, I don’t have the best track record of tracking or recording things. I tend to keep important dates and notes in my head, which hypothetically  could  work if I didn’t have horribly short term memory. Before this, I’ve never actually formally written out my bucket list, despite how many times I’ve idly thought about how cool it would be to know how to play darts or be a proficient harpist. Whether it’s the mess on my desk or in my head, a bit of tidying up is in order. CATEGORY TWO: ACADEMIA Other than surviving
 
4.500 ⁠ 05 Design Computation: Art, Objects and Space, aka a class about 3D modeling chairs, aka 60% of my workload every week and the bane of my existence T_T 
PNR ⁠ 06 pass no record, aka a system during your first semester at MIT in which passing a class is recorded as a P on your transcript, and a fail is sent to the backrooms/doesn't show up at all. too  close, I have a few things I’d love to accomplish academics-wise.  4. Acquire Hardware: use all the facilities in n52 As both a 4.021 student and
 
Design+ ⁠ 07 DesignPlus, or Design+, is a relatively new advisory/learning community for frosh that aims to connect first-years with design opportunities and familiarize us with all of the available makerspaces around campus. Would recommend. :) 5. Monster Hunter: pass the
 
6.100A ⁠ 08 Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python

I often fear that college is some big practical joke everyone is playing on me. You will have the most freeing, most independent, most experimental and hectic four years of your life, they tell me. You will feel your most confident. You’ll discover yourself. You’ll finally make friends who understand you on such a deep, fundamental level, and then… Poof. Four years fly by and we rip that away from you. We kick you out and make you work some silly 9-5, or throw you into 4 years of graduate school, and you think it’s going to be the same, but it’s not. And you’re going to sit there, either in your research lab or your car on your morning commute or in your suffocating little cubicle, and you’re going to think: Is this all there is? Is this all I will be? I’m afraid that this is my peak, as I gallivant and frolic across this all-too-familiar-yet-not-familiar-enough campus. I’m just some girl who overshared a tad bit too much on some college admissions blogs. Someone who didn’t make use of her MIT education, took it for granted, didn’t challenge herself enough so she dropped her computer science major just to end up as some strange cop-out major instead. As my time ticks away, regret eats away at everything I do. Should I have studied abroad? Should I have taken a gap year? Should I have done research and just applied to grad school for media studies? Why am I going into tech when I know it’s not what I want to do at the end of the day? How much of a role does money really play in my life? I’ve been revisiting the show Fleabag as of late and when I watch interviews with Andrew Scott and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, I feel a discernible ache in my chest. There’s a warmth that spreads over and I feel my heart lurch and clench. And though it’s hard to put into words, I can only think to label this feeling as regret. And guilt. And longing. When I was a kid, I loved performing. I loved the idea of entertaining other people in any form or shape possible. I would perform on top of the coffee table, singing loudly and dancing in exchange for smiles and claps from my grandparents. At around age 4 or so, I discovered YouTube and the idea of video making. I particularly was enthralled by the idea of LPs, or Let’s Plays. The mere notion that people would watch me play video games was something so exciting and foreign. I stole my mom’s camcorder, propped it up on some books, and pointed it at my desktop as I played Club Penguin. I was so giddy; I blathered on and on about the optimal way to make money in game and how to complete the secret agent missions. Perhaps I was just a tad bit too lonely as an only child, but talking to the camera, fully knowing this wouldn’t be posted anywhere, made me feel as though I had a friend. That someone was really listening. I eventually did post some videos to YouTube, and even when my mom caught me and told me to never upload anything to YouTube, I still continued to do it because it was something I found so interesting. And as YouTube developed more and more, I expanded my horizons past just the world of gaming and Let’s Plays and started watching vloggers — people like Dan Howell, Phil Lester, kickthepj, Grace Helbig. I loved how their content was so simple in nature: just them being funny and telling stories. Being genuine. Around middle school, I started to upload more and more YouTube videos to my channel, a lot of them just being walkthroughs for video games or even tutoring videos that were guides to how to solve the latest Algebra homework or reviews for our US history class. Eventually in high school, though, the reality of the situation settled in, along with the self-doubt. It’s cringey, I thought, to make all this content for no one. It’s embarrassing. It’s pathetic. And so I stopped, save for the occasional song cover here and there. As I stopped videomaking, I also stopped playing videogames, throwing myself into school. Focusing on something realistic. As much as I loved videomaking and playing games and singing and songwriting, it wasn’t going to pay the bills. So chemistry and biology became my life. Getting into a good school became my top priority. And by my senior year, my hard work had paid off. MIT called my name and I packed my bags, ready to go. But by my freshman year, something funny happened. I had done everything I had planned to do. I worked hard, I got into the school of my dreams, I made friends and yet, and yet, and yet… Nothing. As a kid, I feel like I’ve always dreamed really fucking big. I wanted to open an animal reservation as big as the San Diego Safari Park and live away my life, taking care of animals. I wanted to start my own animal rescue or shelter or something of that nature. I wanted to do something meaningful with my life, something bigger than myself. And though I shoved all those thoughts down in high school, really buckled down to make sure I stayed realistic and grounded, all these thoughts came flooding back to me in college. I sit here now, almost 10 years later, still feeling dissatisfied with my trajectory. I have a job lined up, and it’s good. I have a boyfriend I’m ready to move in with, to tackle New York City together, but I still am here feeling as if I didn’t accomplish enough. That I didn’t do the thing that I set out to do. That I’m settling. Compromising. And it’s stupid because I’m only fucking 20 years old and there’s a whole life ahead of me, so many years that I haven’t lived yet and that college is only just a small blip of time. But now it feels almost desperate, like I’m clawing my way for some sort of purchase, begging for more time because I understand now what it feels like to run out of it. Give me a redo, I cry, I’ll make something of myself this time. Let me try again, I say, I promise I’ll make it worth it. This is all to say that I’m afraid. I’m afraid that this is all my life is and all that it will ever amount to. I’m afraid that five years from now I’m going to be working the same job, content with being boring and simple. Okay with tippy tapping at my keyboard to work on products that don’t really do anything at all. Comfortable with the life I’ve carved out for myself without ever doing anything really meaningful at all. There’s still an itch, a want to try content creation for real, this time. To pursue finally writing that YA novel I’ve had planned in my head for years. Or finally writing that webcomic that I’ve been developing. Or finally taking a crack at starting a proper YouTube channel, one that doesn’t lean into my academic prowess or university status, but one that’s just about me. I blame the blogs, really, for all this. I think I could’ve let it go had it not been for this platform, the satisfaction that comes with being able to cut myself open and splay it out online, oversharing all these bits and pieces of myself for an audience. All of a sudden, I’m three years old again, dancing on a coffee table, receiving claps and laughs in exchange. But it’s hard. It’s hard to do all these things because my mind is more rational than it was back then. Maybe in the fourth grade I could bang out 400 pages of content like that, but now every word I write receives a critical eye. Hell, even every blog I write does. I’ve got dozens of drafts sitting in the admissions website, crying out for me to finish them, but I can’t. Not interesting enough, I tell myself. Does this really fit my brand? Will people even read this? Aren’t people sick and tired of me? I’ve had four years, no one is reading at all. And then it cuts even deeper. I’m a micro of a micro of a microcelebrity. I write blogs for prospective high school students; how could you possibly kid yourself into thinking you have actual important things to say? How could you want a bigger platform when your writing is only good enough for something as irrelevant and as minuscule as this? And deeper. Well, you’ve wasted your four years of college anyway. You just couldn’t pick one. You’re a mediocre engineer that chose an easy way out. You just did the bare minimum, got some cushy tech job, and now you’ll spend the next four years working on unimpressive, meaningless software. You could’ve maybe done something in media — research, writing, maybe made something of yourself. But you were too afraid to lean into it, too afraid to really go for it. So now you sit here with no real media skills, just some poor attempts at fiction writing, some uninspiring, overemotional blogposts, and half-assed videos. And you’re disappointed. You have the audacity to be disappointed when you did this to yourself. So yeah, it’s been hard. Maybe it’s a bit egotistic to think that I was destined for something bigger. I mean, doesn’t everyone think the world of themself only to realize they are painfully small and insignificant, just like the 8 billion other people out there? I don’t know how to cope with being mediocre. I don’t know how to cope with being insignificant. I don’t know how to cope knowing that this is all there is. I spend a lot of time on Wikipedia reading up on celebrities I admire. In particular, I look at the age they reached stardom and I start to do the math in my head. “Well if she got famous at 16, then..” or “She’s been working for this for 8 years and finally got famous at 27, so..” It’s silly, I know, but it’s a way I reassure myself that maybe there is still time. And of course, there is still time, it’s a matter of if I want to put in the effort. I’d like to clarify that I don’t think the goal is to be famous. I think that feels silly and self-absorbed. I think the goal, instead, is to make something that I’m proud of. And while the blogs do satisfy that to some degree, there’s still a craving for more. More theatrical, more produced, more…anything. So I hope that I can come back to this blog in five years and make myself proud. I hope I’ve learned how to be small and meaningless and be okay with it, or found some way to find meaning and passion in my life. I hope that college is not my peak. I hope that this is not it. I hope that there is more, and I hope that there will continue to be more.

“Where did you learn about functional programming outside of 3.019?” a professor asked me after a lecture one day. “Your [3.010] poster says you’re in the EECS department – is that true?” another asked during office hours just a few weeks later. They were both under the guise that I’m a course 3 (materials science and engineering) major. Rightfully so, too – I’m taking 3.010 (structure of materials) and 3.019 (symbolic and mathematical computing) this semester, and I blow glass in MIT’s glass lab. The truth is, I’m actually majoring in 6-2 (electrical engineering and computer science). So why am I taking (and planning to take) so many course 3 classes, when almost everyone outside the department stops after taking the chemistry GIR? To answer that question, let me tell you the story of how I ended up in 6-2. 6-9 I entered MIT last fall knowing I’d major in 6-9 (computation and cognition). I’d done my fair share of computer programming in high school, and I knew the next logical step would be to invest all my energy into understanding the “artificial intelligence” everyone was raving about. Yes, I didn’t want to study neuroscience (6-4 wasn’t around yet), and AI wasn’t much more than a buzzword to me, but still, I was dead set on the major. Around then, I also heard several stories about people planning to major in one field, only to declare something completely unrelated a year later. That felt like a strange concept at the time, and I was sure I wouldn’t be like that. How dramatically could my interests change in such a short period anyway? (Plus, I’d already made a Courseroad for 6-9.) I became a stereotypical CS student. I coded websites and Discord bots for fun and would include C++ when asked about languages I knew. I never built things that didn’t require a keyboard and mouse. I even found myself a software engineering summer internship – more on that later. I was living the dream, studying CS at the top CS school in the world. And yet, when I took 6.1010 (fundamentals of programming, previously called 6.009) in the spring, I couldn’t feel the passion I’d previously had for the subject. It was partly due to my disliking the class structure, but it also made me want to do something more hands-on. Something involving building things from the ground up. Something I could only learn at MIT… 3A-6 While all this was happening, I discovered my interests in course 3. Before coming to MIT, I’d never particularly enjoyed physics or chemistry, much less considered pursuing them at college. I also never quite understood what “materials science” meant because almost everything can be a material. That all changed after I asked a fellow MITWE clarinettist (a materials science grad student) what exactly people study in the department. “Materials science is super broad, but more specifically, we study the  properties  of things and how to engineer new materials with the desired properties,” he replied. “Things and properties such as?” “Such as that clarinet you’re holding right now – why are its metal keys shiny, and why does its wooden body make it sound so different from a saxophone?” That last question made me think. I’d never contemplated those things before (and I’d always assumed that saxophones were metal to look pretty), yet they seem fundamental to everything around us. Why exactly  is  metal shiny? I’d always instinctively associated shininess with conductors and transparency with insulators, but I’d never known exactly why this was so. These questions eventually led me to learn about solid-state physics through the 3.033 (electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of materials) OCW course. Before I even clicked into it, I could sense something special about it – the course banner was Schrodinger’s equation inside a comic-book exclamation bubble. (It turned out that the previous professor teaching it (Prof. Polina Anikeeva) is a big comic book fan and uses that passion in her teaching; true to form, every pset was in the form of a superhero comic!) Although I didn’t understand much of the content, reading through those comics gave me a sense of what solid-state physics was capable of beyond old, dusty textbooks. 5.111 had made me fear quantum mechanics, but 3.033 taught me to value it as a tool from which all material properties would emerge. This class alone wasn’t enough to convince me to pursue course 3, but then I attended the spring Wulff lecture, which was, by some stroke of luck, given by Prof. Anikeeva. It started with her describing how she got into materials science and her journey into neuroscience later in her career. Her story was particularly inspiring because I felt like I was going through the same process, albeit in the opposite direction. She then talked about her work, which spanned everything from quantum dots to magnetic nanoparticles that stimulated the brain. She even brought several hands-on demos for the audience (including a sheep’s brain from her lab)! I was amazed by how fundamental yet practical materials science could be. It was everything I loved about computer science, but more physical. That lecture was the final push I needed to convince myself to major in course 3. 6-9 And yet, I didn’t declare course 3. I still declared 6-9 as soon as I could. Remember that internship I mentioned earlier? Here’s where it comes into play. I’m currently on an F-1 visa – a non-immigrant visa for a temporary stay. Per federal regulations, if I want to work off-campus, I need work authorization – specifically Curricular Practical Traning (CPT). Obtaining this authorization at MIT may sound straightforward in theory, but there were many hurdles I had to clear along the way; see the appendix for a more detailed account. The TL;DR is that I needed a major directly related to software engineering while also granting first-year students CPT. At the time, I only knew two majors that did that, and 6-9 was one of them. Not declaring course 3 didn’t bother me because of how easy it is to switch majors at MIT, and I’m grateful that course 9 allowed me to do the internship when the summer eventually rolled around. Sadly, that summer was the last time the department would grant CPT, but I digress… Surprisingly, working as a software engineer made me even more excited to study materials science. Not that I dislike software engineering now; on the contrary, I loved it and will try to pursue it as a career. Instead, I realized that studying something more fundamental with a high barrier to entry (in my case, solid-state physics) would be more interesting and also useful for understanding how computers worked. Speaking with other engineers at my company further reinforced this idea. A few expressed regret about not exploring more in college, while others told me about the importance of having a diverse range of backgrounds on a team. There were a handful of other benefits of being too: CPT is built into the major since there’s the option to substitute two summer internships in place of the undergraduate thesis. Course 3 even pays summer tuition to pursue said internships. It’s a tiny major, so it’s very tight-knit and wholesome (or at least more so than course 6). It’s exceptionally well-funded too, so there are plenty of opportunities to use state-of-the-art equipment. (In 3.010, we got to perform x-ray diffraction a few weeks ago.) I felt like I had my whole MIT plan figured out then! I’d switch to course 3 and learn all about nanoelectronics and conduct groundbreaking research about magnetic materials and… 6-2 And then reality hit me. I still wanted to work in software engineering, but federal regulations would forbid that – both before and after graduation – if I  didn’t  major in something directly related to computer science. Careers related to nanoelectronics also have prohibitively high barriers to entry (which was, ironically, one of the things I admired about materials science), and I wasn’t comfortable with the risk associated with switching to that either. I felt so disoriented. How could I do all the exciting course 3 things while still being a course 6? After much contemplation, knocking on doors at 1 am, and speaking with friends, I finally settled on switching from 6-9 to 6-2 with a minor in materials science. Believe it or not, this was an incredibly good outcome for me because 6-2 is a happy medium between software engineering and solid-state physics. Taking 6.004 (computational structures) and 6.046 (design and analysis of algorithms) this semester has breathed life back into my passion for computer science. Course 6 also has a great MEng programme (which Shuli discussed  in this recent post Of course, this isn’t to say that the major doesn’t have its drawbacks. For example, I still need to have taken
 
fewer than a certain number of total units by the end of my junior year ⁠ 01 More specifically, at most 180 units beyond GIRs. This restriction isn’t too bad for me if I plan properly, but many people overshoot the limit through ASEs or too many classes in one semester. Plus, students on an F-1 visa must take at least 36 units per semester, so it’s quite difficult to rectify past mistakes. As strange as it may sound, I’m rather happy that I went through this turbulent journey to converge on my major. It taught me resiliency and flexibility when things don’t go according to plan. By exploring all these different areas of study, I gained insight into how they relate. Figuring out how CPT works along the way was also a big plus. Was it painful? A little. But as the saying goes, better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Appendix – F-1 Student CPT Work Authorization I realized that most MIT students aren’t aware of the policies governing where and when students with an F-1 visa can work, so here’s a short (and by no means comprehensive) guide. Work authorization before graduation almost always manifests as CPT. It’s meant to be “off-campus employment authorization that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly related to the student’s major field of study” (quoted from the International Student Office website). You can read more about it on this ISO page . In practice, this means getting a departmental letter of support before being granted CPT from the ISO. A few implications of this are as follows: Each department has its own CPT policies. For example, course 6 doesn’t grant it for one’s first-year summer, while course 9 no longer offers it at all. I can only work in a field directly related to my major. For example, I can’t work as a software engineer while studying materials science. I can only get CPT after I have a major, and first-year major declarations at MIT only take effect in mid-June. There are fixed periods in the year when CPT is allowed to take effect at MIT. Because of this and the previous point, I had to shorten my summer internship by about a month. I have to register for a summer “internship” course to do a summer internship. Summer registration was rather difficult as a rising sophomore without a first-year or faculty advisor to approve the registration. Plus, I had to pay $620 in summer tuition. After graduation, we can then use Optional Practical Training. OPT involves an application process that I still don’t quite understand, but you can read about it  here  if you’re interested. Luckily, these restrictions don’t apply to on-campus work. (There’s just one restriction of not being allowed to work more than 20 hours per week during the semester, but I don’t work enough hours for that to be a problem anyway.) #Course 3 - Materials Science #Course 6 - Electrical Engineering & Computer Science #Course 9 - Brain and Cognitive Sciences #International Applicants

I’m up, you’re drunk 
I wish I had no work today 
I wish I had no work today Still trapped, from night’s bath 
You wish I had no work today 
You wish I had no work today i don’t feel like doing schoolwork anymore. not that my classes aren’t interesting, because they are! i love thinking about interpreters and category theory. but i don’t want to do actual work. i don’t want to program, i don’t want to solve problem sets. i only like thinking about it. speaking of my classes, i haven’t talked about the classes i’m taking this semester yet. i’ll talk about my three technicals: as you can see, the pattern is “wow the class material is interesting but i don’t want to do actual class work”. it’s not like i   to take these classes to graduate; there’s lots of choices that fulfill my remaining requirements. but the way i’m trudging along this semester feels like i’m being forced to take these classes, even though i picked them because i thought the material was interesting. And just sleep (sleep) 
Again 
Let’s sleep (sleep) 
Again there’s also other things i could be doing, that are probably “better uses of my time”. i could be getting new clothes, or working on my personal projects, of which there are dozens, or writing blog posts like this. i don’t feel like doing any of those. i had to force myself to write this post, and it took way longer than it’d normally take. it doesn’t help that i’ve gotten into gaming again. i’ve written about video games before:  slay the spire celeste night in the woods incremental games when i’m not playing video games, i’m not even playing board games or eating with friends or something nice like that. i’m scrolling through social media, lying in bed, wanting to take a nap even if i feel well-rested. i’ve started drinking more and more caffeine lately. i’m sensitive to caffeine, so it doesn’t take much to give me jitters, around 120mg or so. i’m surprised i haven’t developed a tolerance yet. i’ve taken caffeine sparingly through the summer, and this fall i started drinking it almost every day. it doesn’t even wake me up or anything; i’ve taken good naps after drinking caffeine. i just do it for the thrill of having my heart race. so that’s basically been my life these past two months or so, which is why my blog posts have been slower and more impersonal than usual. video games, sleep, twitter, youtube.

I wish I had the heart for this i feel the senioritis in non-schoolwork things too. i don’t feel like going to many of the events i’m interested in. there’s talks and outings i would’ve liked to go to, museum visits and a capella concerts, musicals and ice skatings and movie screenings, parties and mixers and other dinners—i’m sure i would’ve enjoyed these things, and if getting there wasn’t so hard maybe i would’ve gone, but gods it is so hard to get out of my room. i didn’t get senioritis in high school, but i think i have it now. i can think of many reasons why i didn’t get it when i was a high school senior. i was dealing with a lot of family issues, i was living alone for the first time, and i knew i was taking a gap year after i graduated. that year had enough stressful things happening that schoolwork was an   from dealing with those things. also, i knew my senior year grades would kinda end up mattering, since i was going to apply during my gap year. college senior me is different. i’m grateful to have a return offer lined up, and i’m well on track to graduate, so i don’t have as much reason to do well on my classes. the other’s anticipation. high school senior me would’ve been more excited for his gap year if he wasn’t living alone, if he was still living with his parents and didn’t have much freedom to do what he wanted. for him, the gap year would only be different in that there’d be no schoolwork. but now i know how different not being in mit feels like. from the day i arrived on campus freshman fall, to the day i flew to san francisco this summer for my internship, i stayed entirely in mit. during the summers, i lived on-campus and did urops or teaching or some other things. this summer was the first time i had a nine-to-five, one that i was lucky enough to enjoy. now that i’m back in school i can feel how different it all is.

People walking shoulder-to-shoulder down the Infinite There’s always that one group of people walking down the Infinite  who block up the whole hallway. Whether it’s two people who spaced themselves out in the worst possible way, or 5+ people congesting the hallway like a sinus infection, they’ve collectively forgotten that there are other people using it. You don’t need to have a “We’re off to see the wizard” moment in the middle of the hallway during rush hour. When the MBTA bus finally arrives, only for it to go out of service Happened to me too many times during the ~14 months I’ve been here. And it always happens when I need the bus the most.  It’s like every bus in the general area is conspiring against you to make you suffer through the unpredictable Boston weather. To no surprise, I’m not the only person who’s experienced this. In 2014, someone met up with the MBTA Director David Carney to ask him why this happens . “Typically a bus will be out of service going to the start of its route so there may be as many as 800 that are going out, and then same thing — a number of those will pull back to the garage at the end of their shift, so they’ll see those busses,” Carney said. There are other reasons, too: A mechanical issue or a passenger getting a little bus sick and a cleaning is in order. Then there’s “deadheading.” Sometimes a single bus serves multiple routes on the same day. Maybe it finishes a run as an 86 at Sullivan Station, but then needs to start its next run as a 99 at Wellington Station. “We may have that bus what we call ‘deadhead’ from Sullivan to Wellington, so it will be out of service during that time,” Carney said. Coming from an area with virtually no public transportation around, I like that
 
I don’t have to drive ⁠ 01 I hate driving. The one exam I failed that wasn't at MIT was my driver's test. Professors starting with, “You probably remember this from high school” and then talking about something I’ve never heard about in high school Not all of us have done competitive math or learned whatever a “Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality” is back in high school. I’m not a math wizard like Terence Tao, but I know that the probability of every incoming student at MIT having prior exposure to linear algebra is  not  equal to 1. I usually just deal with it, but I got fed up this past week and released some of that frustration on my notes. When MIT websites don’t work You ever hate it when you’re trying to register for a PE class, but the server breaks because too many students were online? Even though MIT, according to Wikipedia, plays a “key role in the development of modern technology and science”?

Since the beginning of the fall semester of my senior year, I’ve felt a decided shift in the air. I’ve mentioned it before, jokingly referring this period as my “nice era” to my friends. In this new age, people feel a lot more tolerable. The world is a lot more colorful. Things aren’t upsetting or exhausting, but exciting. I’m not sure what caused it or who to thank, because God, I really do want to thank the entity that allowed this, but it feels like, for the first time, I am whole. I’ve historically been known to be somewhat of a firecracker on campus. Whether it be my aggressive commenting style on
 
MIT Confessions ⁠ 01 A Facebook page run by MIT students where we anonymously confess things typically related to MIT or its culture. Yes, it's just as immature as it sounds. I noticed the change this year when I walked into New Vassar dining hall at its peak hours. The line stretched all the way out the door. There were no open tables available. I waited in line for 20 minutes. Normally, irritation would itch at me, pinpricks on the skin. “God, why are all these people fucking eating here? Who even   they? WHY is she sitting like that? Oh my God they’re so LOUD.” Things like that. But as I walked around, cocking my head up and down to find some table to sit at, I found myself thinking, “Wow, I didn’t realize there were so many people here. It’s kind of nice out of all the places there are to be at this time, they chose to be here.” And I stood there for a minute, laughing to myself a little, dumbfounded by the fact that my brain could even conjure up something so genuine and truthful (although in writing it comes across as sarcastic). I’ve been like this ever since, and the change is palpable. It’s often quoted in my friend group, whether jokingly or seriously. “Cami’s in her nice era.” or “Wow, Cami really   in her nice era.” We’ve recently introduced a couple new people into our friend group, since relationships are so dynamic and fluid. One of them is Savoldy, an M.Eng student that was originally friends with Julian Y. ’23 and Mikey I. ’23. I knew of them briefly last year, but didn’t really befriend Savoldy until this year. We often get dinner as a friend group at
 
Baker dining ⁠ 02 Freshman year Cami would be absolutely shocked to hear this since I didn't step into Baker until my junior spring. At one of these dinners, Savoldy exclaimed to me, “Dude, you are just. So nice. You, like, really just light up a room.” To which I quickly replied, “Oh, I’m just in my nice era. Trust me, if you knew me well before this semester you would not be saying that.” And I said this, I felt a little sad. Was this, in fact, just an era? Is this all temporary? Will I slip back into my old self? For the past five years, I’ve made it my New Year’s resolution to be kinder, before scoffing a bit in disbelief. It felt so pathetic to have to think so hard about being kind. When I first started watching  , the follow-up series to the pop culture hit  , I really disliked the titular character, Korra. “She’s such a hothead,” I complained. “If she just fucking   about her problems instead of always just getting angry, maybe she wouldn’t be here in the first place!” …Oh. Eventually, Korra did indeed get better. One of her main development arcs (from what I remember, maybe this is still just projection) is Korra’s need to learn how to channel her anger and stubbornness into productive energy. To still keep the spark that makes her  , but use it intentionally. I find that Korra and I are similar in that manner, where we both entered our four season series not really knowing what to do with ourselves. I knew I was outspoken — I was a loudmouth that never quite understood time and place. My friend, Mikey, recently recapped the first time he met me. “Yeah, I remember seeing you in
 03 Physics E&M angry. Every time you’d enter the classroom, you’d just always be complaining about something. Every time.” And it’s true! There was always something to complain about, it felt like. I had felt so betrayed by MIT at that time: this place that I had built up in my head, that I lauded to be the cornerstone of STEM development, was unnecessarily difficult, with classes so hard that it seemed to beat the self-esteem out of students. As I reflect on my old self, I see a lot of it was just driven by fear. I don’t think I was truly really comfortable with myself until this year. I think a lot about my freshman year self, who was so afraid to speak up in class. Who felt fear every time my friends talked about concepts that seemed to go way above my head. Who was afraid of even playing a chess game because she didn’t like the prospect of losing. Every where I went, it seemed that fear and anxiety colored my experience, and so in retaliation, I overcompensated. I became the rapid-fire loudmouth that just said and did whatever was on her mind. And that was that. And every time I heard whispers of “Well I hear Cami’s   mean”, I just hardened my resolve even more. “Who cares what they think?” I would say angrily to myself. “Who cares? And so what if I’m mean? Maybe that’s just me. I have friends that like me, I think.” Then I would sit there, unhappy and dissatisfied with the image I’ve put out, but unsure if it’s even possible to change it. I would like to give my previous self some credit, though, because without her I wouldn’t be at this point. At our core, we’re the same person. We still call people out on their bullshit. We still viciously defend our friends. We just execute on these things a little differently, use different methods to accomplish our goal. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made as a person. I’m able to do the things my old self couldn’t. I can be loud and cringey in the dining hall, talk about my niche interests without fear of being judged. I can approach anyone and everyone and talk them up without social anxiety or fear. There was a part of me that feared that being kinder would soften me, would make me less vigilant and tenacious in holding my beliefs or standing my ground. Yet I’ve found the opposite to be true. Now, I hold my ground even stronger than before, knowing that there is no ill will or wrath driving my actions, but genuine belief in my argument. There are no personal attacks or impulsive scathing remarks that I will regret, only things I truly mean. And though I don’t know whether this truly is just a phase or not, I’m happy to even be living it, to feel life feel lighter and more full for the first time. I think I’ve spent a lot of myself as some sort of anti-hero, where I just do these bad things or negative things simply because that’s who I believe myself to be. But in these past months, I’ve come to broaden my understanding of myself and realize my full capability. I am not some sort of anti-hero in my own story. I am not forced to be cast as the villain in other people’s stories. It is never too late to grow or change. To opt to be kinder.

TW: Detailed Descriptions of Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Assault, Brief Mentions of Pedophilia and Disordered Eating This piece is just a series of things loosely held together by a vague relation to my identity as a woman. There’s a common theme here, though; it’s pain. I’ve felt violated, angry, spiteful, exhausted, guilty, ashamed. I don’t have anything coherent to say on the topic as a whole. This is a ball of hurt I carry with me, a part of the constant calculus I engage in as I attempt to navigate the world. I wish I had some hope to impart, but my general impression is that growing up is just the process of grappling with the same struggles over and over again, each iteration providing more clarity. I don’t think I’ve done it enough times to yet have wisdom, but I’ve certainly done it. So here, in a collection of vignettes, is a list of thoughts. They’re aimless, agonizing, tiring, burdensome, but they’re also things I’ve chosen to carry with me; they’re part of me, however regrettable that may be. 1     My Existence is Performative I like telling people that I’m a six-foot-tall man in my head. I’m aware it sounds innocuous and rather ridiculous when issuing from the mouth of a 5’ 3” tall girl, particularly if I exclaim it while standing on some elevated surface (usually a table), but it’s true. Or, perhaps true to an extent. I usually say this jokingly, but the joke only extends to the fact that I want it to merit laughter, not because I mean it insincerely. My thoughts on this are really best explained by the following Margaret Atwood quote:  “Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it’s all a male fantasy: that you’re strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren’t catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you’re unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.” I feel eyes on me at all times,  especially  when I’m alone. I am a victim of the societal panopticon; always feeling watched, always experiencing pressure to be a desirable, inexplicable creature whose every emotion and action is beautiful, whose sadness is haunting and perfect. There is a man on my shoulder who judges my every move, who analyzes the lilt of my voice and the curl of my hair. I’ve chosen to be the man because he is inescapable; if my existence is inherently performative, can I wrestle some power away by, at the very least, assuming the role of an audience member in my own life? Recently, I dictated to my friend exactly the series of steps required to charm South Asian parents. Dress in a nicely pressed salawar, bring sweets, wear enough makeup (but not too much). Walk in with a smile plastered on, and ensure that your voice is drippingly saccharine at all times. Offer to help cook, or clean. Carry the food to the table, and watch your every move. Eat enough, but not too much. Suppress the desire to verbally devour the uncle who spouts misogyny and racism. Casually slide in your academic achievements, but be sure to focus on the correct ‘type’ of achievement; not too technical, or else you might be perceived as unfeminine or conniving. Ask after everyone’s health, and everyone’s children, and parents. Be unproblematic. Be soft-spoken. Be docile. I did this every weekend for the first 17 years of my life. 2.    Spite, and Anger, and all the Rest The day after I got into MIT, I was walking on air. I was  so  happy I woke up the next day and laid in bed for 15 minutes, feeling sparkly. I walked into my AP Art History class, and, seeing as I had told my teacher that I was really anxious about decisions, I strolled over to his desk and experienced the following interaction, which felt frankly reality-bending: “I got into MIT!” “Ah, nice. I hope the boy you’ll marry got in, too.” “… sorry?” I hadn’t really been able to parse what he had said. I genuinely thought I had misheard him, because of the sheer ridiculousness of his response.  This, I think, encapsulates much of my experience of being a woman in STEM in my rural Arkansas high school. I was the only girl in my AP Calculus BC class, and I was usually one of a handful in my physics classes, which were taught by blatantly inept men. Most of them spent all of their instruction time either spouting conservative idealogy or poorly concealing insecurity about their own professional failures (I had one instructor who spent the duration of our class bemoaning the fact that he had been denied by NASA because he ‘was too old’).  I scored 100s on almost every exam I had in my AP science and math classes in high school. I cared deeply about the content of these classes; I saw them as preparatory and instrumental to my future success. But I was almost obsessive. I  had  to set the curves in my classes. I felt that earning those scores made my presence in these classes unimpeachable; I was valedictorian, and no man who was doing worse than me in his classes had any grounds upon which to act as if I was inept. So I did better than  everyone.  I was bitter, spiteful, and jealous. The boys in my high school were so unworried; they skated through their classes and knew that, with little to no effort, they could have what they wanted. They didn’t have to worry about being perceived as capable; it was practically already a given. I clung to every point, fueled by my ever-brewing anger at the nonchalant teenage boys who surrounded me. I was perpetually seething during my adolescence.  I think a lot about being an angry, messy woman. I was confrontational and arrogant because I had space to be. I  was  better than these boys, if only because I cared. This summer, I watched Fleabag, a British comedy that follows a problematic, nymphomaniacal, reckless woman. An inelegant, imperfect, angry woman. The amount of vindication I felt, being able to root for her, was strangely freeing. I wonder if I was truly rooting for myself in high school.  3.    Love I can’t think about being in love without feeling violated anymore. I remember standing in front of the mirror of my freshman dorm room, realizing that my chest was covered in sallow welts, half-healed bruises left by my partner. I was bitten, thrown, groped, all without being asked. I remember barely suppressing my trepidation as he, in the first week of our relationship, reached over and began touching me intimately after his roommate had walked into the room. I couldn’t say anything, and I wasn’t sure that I wanted to. I was struggling to reconcile the feelings of elation and desolation; I had the boy I wanted, and that felt  good,  but he hurt me almost daily. Beyond being continually verbally degraded, in the words of a friend, “he did whatever he wanted to [me], and even if that sometimes made [me] feel good, it seems like he didn’t really care.” I really, really wanted him to be happy. To be happy with me, to be a good girlfriend, to satisfy him. So I let him do what he wanted; when he held me down by the neck and forced me to answer questions, I tried my hardest to contain my panic, attempting to keep my breathing even. Mostly I just remember the pressure mounting on my throat. I was so vulnerable, and all I could think was that I wanted it to stop, to pause, to be allowed to breathe. I raked at his fingers, hoping for some respite, but his hand didn’t budge.  I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. He asked for consent an hour after everything had happened, and everything in me rebelled as I simply avoided the question. He had scared me, badly. He liked making pedophilia jokes.  “How can I get charges for this?” was an idle thought he’d often voice while I lay in various states of undress in his bed. “You’re so little.” “You’re mine.” “I can see the fear in your eyes.” “I’m a six-foot-four man kissing an underage girl. Sounds like a pedophile to me.” I erased as much of this as I could, focusing on how handsome, or charismatic, or funny he was. He wasn’t really any of these things, but I maneuvered my way around it because I wanted him so badly. The fact that these comments filled me with dread was an overreaction. Fear and romance occupy the same spot in my mind, now. I was desirable because I was little, feminine, exploitable. I was  his,  because I was a girl. He ate me alive, from the inside out. 4.    Ambition  I did my eighth-grade history project on the Feminine Mystique, a seminal work in Western Second Wave Feminism. Betty Friedan describes the ideal woman, who is able to juggle family life and a career, and achieves the heights of success in both. Friedan’s proposal always felt bitterly divorced from reality. It felt liberating to forsake a personal life, and when I was younger, I often loudly proclaimed that I would  never  get married or have children. I have dreams of a little girl, and it feels like a betrayal of my professional sanctity. I worry that I’m failing myself by wanting a family. But I do. 5.    Beauty The girl in the mirror is just that – clearly a girl. There’s no ambiguity here. I have traditional femininity in spades. I wear a skirt at least once a week, and have a collection of sundresses. Eyeliner, and long hair. Earrings, a pearl necklace perennially on my neck.  My femininity is inescapable; I hate the curve of my legs, the swell of my hips. I can’t get around them. I look in the mirror and wish I had a sharp jawline and a flat chest. Yet… I curl my hair, apply my makeup, and tie a ribbon in my hair. I look in the mirror, and I don’t change anything. One of the few memories I still have from my childhood is crying on the edge of the bathtub after having weighed myself. Too heavy, compared to the thin, beautiful white girls in their shimmering cheer outfits. I can’t eat alone in public. Hunger is private; I’ll never learn to swallow my shame.  6.    Exhaustion and Guilt I am deeply tired. I have little else to say.

I officially graduated from MIT last year, but I’m still here, doing what we call “MEnging” (em-en-jing). The MIT
 
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ⁠ 01 Colloquially known as EECS, pronounced eeks, or more often just as 'Course 6'. How does it feel? I don’t know. Weird? Normal? Sometimes it feels so normal, walking down the Infinite like I always do, on my way from something or other to something else. And sometimes I walk by EC and can’t recognize any of the people sitting and laughing around the grills, and I remember that I’m older than I used to be. (Aren’t we all :P) Everything is the same and different, all mixed up. I’ve been reflecting on the changes in bits ‘n’ pieces as the semester goes on; this post is my attempt to get them all organized and sorted out. I used to live in East Campus, an undergrad dorm, but of course had to move out once I was no longer an undergrad. MIT also has graduate dorms, so I could have moved into one of those. Instead, I chose to move into an off-campus apartment with three of my friends. Honestly, it’s pretty much the same price and distance from campus as most of the grad housing, but I get a bit more control about who I live with and what the facilities are like. Living in an apartment with 4 people instead of a long hallway with 40 is definitely very different. A lot of things are simpler: splitting up fridge space, figuring out who left their stuff all over the table, deciding how we want to decorate the living room and what kitchen utensils to buy or get rid of. In some ways, there’s more camaraderie, because I’m closer with my roommates, but I also find myself alone in a quiet house a lot more than I used to. East Campus was like two minutes away from most of my classes. Now I live a horrifying 15-to-20-minute walk from campus! So far away! …okay, it’s not that far (in fact it’s a distance that many undergrads already live from campus) but it is a big enough change that it’s shifted how I approach leaving the house. I can’t just go home for lunch between classes, so instead I’ve started packing a lunch. It’s kinda fun tucking in an apple and a little treat next to my tupperware of leftovers :3 When I leave for the   day
 
I ain’t coming back, ⁠ 02 Am I dating myself with this reference? Is it now possible to date oneself with Kesha? How time does advance... Because my walk is longer now, I’ve also gotten more into biking! I owned a bike for all of undergrad, but I almost never went anywhere that was further than a 15 minute walk away (and even that was embarrassingly rare), so I never really needed to use my bike. Now that biking cuts my daily commute from like 20 to 7 minutes, I’m suddenly a lot more motivated to get out my helmet. The best part is that now that I’m more used to biking, it feels more like something I can just do anytime! I used to walk to my favorite Trader Joe’s across the river, but this weekend I biked it in half the time. It’s kind of awesome to feel like there’s been a physical expansion in what areas of Cambridge are convenient and easy to get to for me. This is one that hasn’t changed quite as much. A lot of my friends are still in Boston, either because they got jobs here, they’re also MEnging/in grad school, or they haven’t finished undergrad yet. So I still hang out with mostly the same people. But I’ve definitely noticed that I have to be a bit more intentional about it now – we’re all more scattered and spend less time on campus, and so I’m much less likely to run into people by chance than I used to be. One change that’s really nice is that I go to fun events off-campus more! Honestly, there’s no great reason for this, since most of the fun things I go to are not very much closer to Central Square than they were to East Campus.  But now that the spell of the campus bubble has broken (and, maybe, now that I have a little more time), it just feels easier, and as a result I’ve had some fun adventures. (To be blogged at a later date!) I’m still hosed, sort of, but the word doesn’t mean what it used to. Hosed used to mean   Nowadays hosed means  Less grading would still be nice, but I appreciate that these days, getting 8 hours of sleep is never in question. Oh yeah, and I grade things now, that’s different! The MEng program requires you to meet a certain set of course requirements and complete a thesis, and every semester that you’re registered for a class, you have to pay tuition. However, if you can get a job as a Teaching Assistant for a class or a Research Assistant for a lab, the job will not only pay your tuition but also award you a pretty hefty stipend! So in exchange for dedicating 20 hours a week of my time to
 
6.1040, ⁠ 03 Software Studio - it's a junior/senior level class focusing on website design. Plus, although the grading can suck up (way too much) time, I actually really enjoy working as a TA. I’ve been an LA before — a Lab Assistant aka basically a baby TA — and this is like all the parts of the job I loved plus more: I get to help students at office hours and on the class forum, but I also get to teach recitations and help decide the structure and direction of the class. It’s very cool, and also pretty funny, to be on the other side of the table. I find myself being unhelpful in the way I always hated: “Sorry for the delay, the next pset/the grades/the next pset and the grades will be out soon!” It turns out that on the backend, TAs and professors are just people too, working hard as a team, a little overwhelmed, nagging each other in the chat to get their work done… It definitely gives me a perspective, and a respect, I wish I’d had more of while I was still in undergrad. Other than TA-ing, I’m taking two classes, which are both pretty unremarkable. And of course, I’m doing research, the main part of my actual degree. To be honest, so far, I’m not exactly sure what to say about the research. I’m working with a PhD student on a pre-existing project, and we have a pretty good sense of the end goal of my work. But even with that level of direction (which not all research projects have), the early stages can still feel like a lot of stumbling around in the dark and trying to come up with ideas. I think (aka I’ve been reassured) that this is appropriate, though, so I’m not letting it bother me toooo much. Hopefully as I continue to work, more clarity will emerge. The MEng can feel a bit like a liminal space sometimes. I’m living a life I’ve never led before, but at the same time, making plans to leave and lead another. To graduate, you need to complete six classes and write your thesis. I was able to get three classes out of the way in undergrad (letting classes carry over is another reason this is a popular program), and I’m taking two right now. So my hope for next semester is to take one more class, write a thesis, and graduate. And then I’ll be done: out in the “real” world, a “real” adult. I signed a job offer two days ago (!), so I guess that means the next year of my life is set. Software engineering in San Francisco… if MEnging feels different now, I know that’s going to be a whole new world. But for now I’m mostly just taking things day by day and week by week. Doing my research, getting my grading done, trying to remember to make plans with my friends, going to new restaurants and having some fun on the weekends. Although my life has changed and will continue to change dramatically, I think in some ways all the change has let me see that so much stays the same. Just because you’re in high school or college or grad school or your first job you’re not sure you’ll stick with, that doesn’t mean you’re waiting for your life to begin. You’re living it now: one day of your life, every single day. So I’m trying to enjoy each day for what it is, and not wait on what it will be. #MEng

TW: Depression, Suicidal Ideation My friend Nathan is aggressively bad at reading maps. Notoriously, infamously, comically bad at it. Not even his phone’s mobile navigation app can save him from his perpetual state of spatial lostness. In his words, “location just isn’t something [his] brain keeps track of”. I find this simultaneously hilarious (sorry, Nathan) and utterly incomprehensible. Sense of place is perhaps the most permanent aspect of how (if you’ll excuse the pun)
 
I navigate memory. ⁠ 01 Also how I navigate campus, unlike some people we know When I came to MIT, the repertoire of places I carry in my heart more than doubled. The most secluded desk on the fifth floor of Barker, where I went when I  needed  to work for eight hours straight; the cork walls of its cubicle are covered with Sharpie messages from students;
 
some despairing, others encouraging, and yet more cracking ‘ur mom’ jokes, painting an apt metaphor for the psyche of the average MIT student. ⁠ 02 Plus it has easy access to two electrical outlets . These places fill me with quiet wonder, the sort that floods up your chest with something like fairy dust, an emotion I always feel when I think about MIT.  I’ve skipped the place I spent the most time during my first year at MIT, though. My old room, number 351, in Next House. It was approximately the same as every other Next House room. Peeling walls covered in softly reflective cream paint, commercial tile floors, a door so blue it almost hurts your eyes. Standard wooden desk and bed. Me and my two roommates were crammed into a room meant to be a double, a situation that positively bred comical scenarios. Athena once brought a cubic foot of used tape back from her Terrascope project. Jennifer is so bad at waking up in the morning that
 
she set alarms every other minute. ⁠ 03 Which miraculously managed to wake up everybody in the room except for her There’s a reason 351 also fills my mouth with salt though: It was the place where I experienced the most all-encompassing despair I’ve ever felt in my entire life. There’s not really an elegant way to introduce this, so I won’t mince words – my mental health was abysmal during my first semester at MIT. That room was where I grappled with this constantly, day-in day-out, during the most unpleasant months of my life, feeling terribly alone. My sadness slipped into despair, which eventually faded into numbness, night bleeding into day, while lay on my floral bedsheets in 351. I stayed in that bed for days at a time during my first IAP, unable to force myself out of bed to eat, staring at the ceiling for hours instead of sleeping. During my first semester at MIT, I slept 4 hours a night and ate a single meal a day. I lost 10 pounds in 2 months, wasting away, as I did everything I could to attempt to keep my thoughts at bay (primarily, sleep and food deprivation). I was trying so hard to hang on to control, and a facade of ‘togetherness’ that I felt unable to communicate how badly I was struggling. Not that my friends didn’t notice (I like to tell myself I was better at hiding it than I was). A friend of mine once mentioned that I seemed like I “had my sh*t together”. He was impressively incorrect in this assertion, but I began to feel that I was good at concealing my mental state, that I was getting away with my little secret.  I felt incredibly inept. For me, I always felt manic during my worst nights. A single thought, a kernel of self-loathing, that, when I was left alone, would boil over into a spiral of crippling, overbearing feelings of worthlessness. It scared me – it still does, when I think back on it. A fragment of a sentence was all it took. For much of my life, I’ve felt this way to varying degrees, but I always felt insulated by the fact that my ‘togetherness’ was unimpeachable. I was confident, capable, likable, and no one could produce any evidence to the otherwise, even if I never felt like I was any of these things. But things were falling apart, and it didn’t take long for someone to point it out. One night, as I sat in my corner in 351, I was texting that same friend. I mentioned, with forced casualness, that I had slept 4 hours the night before, and would have to avoid sleep until 5 AM to run a late-night wing outing. He asked if I had eaten. I hadn’t. If I had taken my medications. I hadn’t. In a moment of frustration, as I insisted that I was alright, he sent me a single message that has haunted me since. “Your life is always in shambles, Shorna. I eat when I’m hungry, I sleep when I’m tired, I take my medicine because I know I will suffer otherwise. I’m more on top of my PSETs than you are.” I felt a pit of shame drop into my stomach. He had seen right through me. My skin crawled, my throat was ablaze, and there was a single thought on my mind.  My life is in shambles. My life is in shambles. My life is in shambles. F*ck. I hate myself. Why am I even here? … All of this was around nine months ago. I’ve gotten much, much better. I’m on antidepressants, and I take them regularly. I sleep eight hours a night (sometimes more), and I eat regularly (three times a day!). I’m happy, and productive, and most importantly, stable. I’ve learned the art of being kind to myself, something I’ve struggled with for all 18 years of my life. I feel  anchored.  I feel safe with myself, in my head. I don’t feel like there are enemies within my own cranium.  Perhaps the most frustrating thing I grapple with now, though, is the fact that that regulating my mental health is an active process. I have to put in effort to maintain my wellness; I have to force myself to be kind to myself when I’m unable to finish my work fast enough, or I hate the way I look today, or I can’t keep up when my brilliant friends talk about their work. I have to use the things I’ve learned. I have to let myself rest. Being happy is hard and doesn’t come easy. Somedays I reach back into that version of myself, and I still sometimes feel like my life is in shambles. It can be incredibly frustrating when I can’t shake that feeling, but I’ve learned to keep moving. Sometimes I still need to cry for a few hours. I make use of my support system. I guess, at the most basic level, I think I’ve learned to accept that my life  can  be in shambles. Being a human is difficult, MIT is an acutely challenging place, and having a hard time says nothing about my worth or ability, or whether or not I ‘fit’ here. It is frustratingly hard to believe that with every particle of my being, but it’s true. And I’ve been happy, no matter how much my life was (and is) falling apart. 351 is where my friend Omkar tortured me with incredibly off-tune guitar playing. Where I laid on my grass green carpet with my roommates, listening to Rebecca Sugar’s  Time Adventure,  as I turned 18. Where I did my 18.100B PSETs (I like real analysis a LOT, ok?) 351 is where, in some strange, twisted, throat-coatingly saccharine way, I truly found paradise.

In my mind,
 
many MIT classes ⁠ 01 Many, but by no means all. Giving a number is hard: do you count distinct classes, or should you weigh classes based on how many people take them? With the latter approach, I'd say it's around 60% of classes. , if you will:
 
problem set classes and project classes. ⁠ 02 Because of how I chose to divide the classes, I'll mention grading a lot. Of course, grading is only a small part of any class, but it helps demonstrate the differences I want to show. Consider MIT’s  General Institute Requirements science GIRs They’re all pretty similar, structurally. In fact, I can make up a science GIR right now. Let’s call it, I dunno, 19.01: Introduction to Hacking. A student’s grade in 19.01 is based on three components: The problem sets are every week, except for weeks when there’s an exam, so there’s around ten in all. The midterms happen at the end of a month. The final is only called a final because it’s at the end of the semester, it’s not “cumulative” in the sense that it tests everything from the beginning. The science GIRs have small differences between them. Some have biweekly problem sets. Some, instead of saying “midterm” or “final”, say, “quiz” or “exam”, or
 
“celebration of learning”. ⁠ 03 Notably, 3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry. It's as cheesy as it sounds. What about project classes? These tend to be more varied, depending on the nature of the project, but there are still patterns. Going back to the GIRs, I’d say the strongest example of a project class are the  CI-H subjects The grade in 23.01 Writing about Hacking consists of: The core of the grade will come from three projects. Project 1 will be assigned at week 4 and due at week 8, project 2 will be assigned week 7 and due week 11, and project 3 will be assigned week 10 and due week 15. Note that these will also align with months: project 1 due two months into the semester, project 2 due three months in, and project 3 due four months in. The structure’s looser here, but it’s going to be something like that. Or maybe the due dates will be two weeks earlier, with another due date afterward for a revised version. Or the deadlines will divide the semester into thirds instead, though that’s less common. Because there are six science GIRs, in a given semester, it’s more likely than not that you’re taking one. Because everyone in MIT has to take them, it’s more likely than not that several of your friends are in science GIRs. And because all the science GIRs have the same structure, they also have the same schedule. This creates what people call
 , ⁠ 04 Which is happening now, by the way, and what inspired this post. It’s helpful to note that a semester is roughly four months, or sixteen weeks. Exams thus happen at around the end of every “month”. These tend to line up with calendar months, but because months are slightly longer than four weeks, the semester ends at mid-December or mid-May. Even if they don’t have any exams, project classes contribute to midterm season too. As project deadlines tend to split the semester into quarters, they align with the exam dates of other classes. Inconvenient, but a consequence of classes starting and ending at the same time. The consequences of midterm season are far-reaching. Most visibly, it’s a time of semester when everyone’s tired or stressed or busy. The MIT Admissions blogs get less posts, while  MIT Confessions 
Spring break ⁠ 05 MIT does not have a fall break. Another thing is that, by my definition, midterm season is  . This is the majority of the semester! These ten weeks aren’t all equal though, as the effects of midterm season are felt strongest near the middle, due to several factors, such as: so they can “relax” fall is a nice season The middle of midterm season has also been called  hell week many other in the past Outside of the science GIRs, it’s relatively rare for a class to have four exams. Most classes that do have either two exams, a midterm and a final, or just one exam, a final. In this case, a stronger weight would be placed on problem sets, rather than exams. An example is
 
18.404 Theory of Computation: ⁠ 06 Most examples in this post are from classes I've taken, so it's a rather biased selection. Also, instructors change frequently, and with them, the class structure. Even within this format, there’s lots of variation. Exam format could be anything from a two-hour long exam, closed-book, that everyone takes in the same room, to untimed, open-book, take in a 24-hour period, and everything in between. Weights could vary significantly. I think there was once a year when 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics was graded: Many classes also have weights that are more flexible than this. For example, 6.191 Computation Structures had weights that added to more than 100%, so you could choose what to omit. Sometimes, in lieu of exams, these classes would have final projects instead. Sometimes there’ll be a final and a final project. Despite having projects, the majority of the grade will come from the problem sets. Here’s 24.902 Introduction to Syntax: Then there are classes that are   problem sets, like 6.511 Foundations of Program Analysis, which only had weekly problem sets. On the other extreme is 18.212 Algebraic Combinatorics, which only had three problem sets! Finally, problem set classes don’t need to have problem sets. A notable example is 6.101 Fundamentals of Programming, which has a weekly
 
“lab”. ⁠ 07 Not to be confused with actual labs, which are more like projects, these labs are more like problem sets. The difference isn't well-defined, but whatever. Classes could have both problem sets and labs. In the extreme case, a class could have several weekly components, like 6.390 Introduction to Machine Learning, which has: The biggest variation is whether there are several projects a semester, or one project developed over the semester. This semester I’m taking 6.112 Dynamic Computer Language Engineering, which is one big project: A class could still be a project class yet have exams. One example is 6.180 Computer Systems Engineering. Although it has 30% of its weight coming from exams, it’s most known for its design project, so I’d handily classify it as a project class: Often a class has several separate projects in the beginning of the semester, later developing to a larger project. Consider 6.104 Software Studio: For an example that’s not in
 
Course 6, ⁠ 08 The Electrical Enginering and Computer Science department. Sorry, I'm majoring in both Mathematics and this, so by nature most of my classes are one of these two. Or 18.821 Project Lab in Mathematics, which has “project” in the name: Again, note that many of the deadlines line up with the end of semester months, which often align with exam periods. It’s arguable that several classes I put under “project classes” that were more like problem set classes. I’ll admit the line is a bit fuzzy in some cases. Consider, for example, 12.001 Introduction to Geology: Or consider 6.UAT Oral Communication. It’s kinda like a project class, but there’s so many projects that it’s hard to argue they’re projects: What about 21M.401 Concert Choir? It’s a class that’s entirely about participating in, as the name suggests, the MIT Concert Choir: Language classes have almost daily assignments, but I wouldn’t call them “problem set classes”. Here’s 21G.101 Chinese I: As I said in the introduction, it’s hard to chuck MIT classes into bins, because they’re so diverse! Midterm season is shortly followed by  , which is like midterm season but shorter. That means there’s more stress crammed into a shorter period of time! If midterm season was a bad enough confluence of deadlines and exams, finals season is worse, as it’s likely that   has something big happening in final season. The explanation’s simple enough: if a class has any exams, it’s likely it has a (heavily weighted) final exam; if a class has any projects, it’s likely it has a (heavily weighted) final project. Being final exams and projects, they’re all due during finals period. There’s not as many posts on the Admissions blogs about finals season. My theory is that finals season is worse enough that people don’t even have the   to post things, although I haven’t actually done the data on this. tl;dr: hug an MIT student, it’s midterm season

This Friday,
 
at 8:05 PM ⁠ 01 hopefully, if we're running on schedule. 
Family Weekend A Cappella Concert ⁠ 02 lovingly known as FWACC, pronounced fff-whack. The last time FWACC happened, I was still a freshman, desperately trying to get on my feet. In September, I had auditioned for seven or eight
 
acapella ⁠ 03 this seems to be the standard spelling at MIT, although I can't really figure out why. , and, at a school where I already felt like I was at an academic disadvantage  due to my background FWACC was my first concert. I auditioned for a solo in
 
the group song ⁠ 04 "Sucker", by the Jonas Brothers, which was all the rage in 2019. one of the Asymptones songs At the soundcheck before the concert, we ran our songs, making sure that everything sounded good in the large, cavernous space. I walked to the front of the stage when it was my time to start singing and did my best to produce the notes. It went reasonably well, and we were moving on to the next song when one of the music directors of
 
the group running the show ⁠ 05 the acapella groups rotate the responsibility of running FWACC + CPWACC; my freshman year, <a href="http://ohms.mit.edu">the Ohms</a> were in charge. “You’ve got the notes, just relax.” I don’t know if I was really more relaxed during my performance during FWACC—the whole experience was this surreal blur of singing and adrenaline—but I remember that moment, crystal clear. It was someone taking extra time to give advice to someone not in their group, but who they knew needed it. I’ve kept that thought close to my heart ever since, and although I’m still not perfectly confident taking up space on stage, I’ve gotten better and better as time has gone by.  As I make my way through my senior year, I have been thinking a lot about all of these small kindnesses which have shaped my experience here at MIT. I think about the senior who taught me how to prepare a turkey and run a kitchen  for Thanksgiving There have been ups and downs—there always are—but, when I think about what has most changed me during my time at MIT, it is these moments. These are the moments which have allowed me to develop my voice, both literally and figuratively. Without these speckled pieces of advice and support, I might never have wandered into student government, or learned to sing loudly in a choir or  on a stage 
where I could be kind to myself, ⁠ 06 I've dropped two full classes this semester and am now in fewer units than I've <em>ever</em> been at MIT!  more competent, more able and willing to put myself out there and sing, or speak, or write. This year, three long and tumultuous years after my first baby steps into acapella, I have a solo in the FWACC group song. I’m excited. I’m nervous. Most importantly, though, I’m happy to see how far I’ve come. I’m happy to see other people in my acapella group and around my dorm take their own first steps toward taking up space and developing their own voice. I’m happy to feel like, despite everything, I am doing my best to practice kindness, hoping to pay it forward as I go.

In light of interviews quickly approaching, I thought I’d do a post about interviews, especially as an admissions officer on the EC team and someone who has experienced the EC interview both as an applicant and an EC. Here we go! A bit of background information before we dive in In our holistic application process, the interview is one aspect where you can add some context and details to your application. It’s a chance to tell your story and for us to get to know you as a three-dimensional person, which is what we strive to do with all the other parts of the application as well. At MIT, our alumni conduct the interviews, and alumni who volunteer to help with these interviews are called ECs (Educational Counselors). After you submit your application, you may be contacted for an interview based on the availability of alumni in your region of the world.  It is more of a conversation than an interview, so don’t stress out too much about it (I will talk more about this later); it’s one way for us to get to know you. Though the interview is optional, it is a great chance not only to show a different side of yourself but also to get to know  us , and talk to someone who has gone to school at MIT.  Past blogs about interviews Below are some of the past blog posts about interviews gathered in one place. While a few of the MIT interview logistics may have changed since these posts were written, the insights offered in these posts are still very relevant today.  EC takes on the interview: https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/notes-on-the-interview-the-ec-edition/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/interview-tips-from-an-mit-educational-counselor/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/thoughts_on_the_mit_interview/ People talking about their own interview experience: https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/my-mit-interview1/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/post_8/ General helpful posts: https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/advice-for-the-mit-interview/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the_interviewpart_1/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the_interviewpart_2_1/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the_interviewpart_iv_1/ https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/advice_on_how_to_approach_your/ 1. Process and Timeline In some of the posts above, you may have noticed that the authors mention contacting your EC for an interview. Our current process does not require you to do this. After you submit your application, if there is an available EC in your area, they will reach out to you using the contact information provided on your application. However, even though you do not need to initiate the email with your EC,  please respond promptly . Otherwise, they are left wondering what happened, and your EC likely has other interviews they need to schedule as well (and is volunteering to do this in their free time). It’s also a good idea to check your spam inbox to ensure it didn’t end up there by mistake. The only things an EC knows about you when they contact you are your name, school, and contact information – we do this on purpose! The EC does not see what you submitted in your application because we want the conversation to be organic. The interview is a chance to talk more deeply about the things you’re interested in and why, and to tell your story to a real live person. It’s much more of a conversation than an “interview.” Regarding timeline, most EA interviews usually happen in November, and RA interviews in January and February. If we are not able to offer you an interview, your interview will be waived and will not negatively impact your application. 1a. Are interviews required? They are not, because it is based on the availability of ECs in your area. However, if you are offered an interview, I would recommend you take it. Not just so we can learn more about you personally, but also because it’s another way for you to learn more about  us  and gauge whether there’s a right fit. You get to hear about MIT from someone who actually went here and hear about their MIT experience. Plus, it’s good practice, and a lot of these alums are doing cool things out in the world!  2. What to expect Every interview will be different because there isn’t a list of standard questions that an EC is required to ask. Again, this is because we want it to be a conversation. And like any conversation, it is a two-way effort. Feel free to ask your EC (thoughtful) questions about their time at MIT; I know many of them are more than happy to talk to you about their experiences, life after MIT, etc. which is why they volunteer their time to do this. Of course, the interview  is  mostly about you, so the majority of the conversation will be focused on you, but do take advantage of the time at the end to ask about their experiences. And while you don’t have to know every detail about MIT, maybe don’t ask something like, “Are there any opportunities to study abroad?” because that is on our website  here . I remember my own MIT interview was one of the most chill interviews out of all my college interviews – we talked about my interests, my school, my community, etc. and I got to ask my interviewer about her experiences. It was a relaxing conversation. Just be yourself! That’s the whole point of the interview after all. On average, you can expect a length of around 30-60 minutes. However, the length is not an indication of how well you did. I want to stress again that this is just a conversation to get to know you better. It’s okay to be nervous, but don’t stress out about it too much :) 3. How to prepare It really helps if you have things in mind to talk about and can elaborate on your answers with details or examples. You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) prepare a whole speech about each of your activities and interests, but even spending just 10 minutes beforehand reflecting on your activities helps. Which activities mean the most to you? What projects did you work on? Which experiences within those activities stand out to you? What do you do outside of school and why? Allow the answers to flow genuinely. Also, don’t feel like you need to only talk about STEM-related things the whole time. Yes, if you’re applying to MIT, you are probably interested in STEM, but it’s normal to have other interests too. The EC is trying to get to know you as a person and learn what makes you excited. It’s because we are all passionate about different things that the community is as cool and awesome as it is, so just be sincere. There’s no right or wrong answer. 3a. But how do I talk about myself and what if I’m not interesting enough? I don’t think you should worry too much about trying to sound interesting. Everyone is interesting in their own way – you might think that something you do is “boring”, but it’s actually super interesting to someone else because they know nothing about it. If you talk about things that interest you, they will shine through in your own way and that makes it interesting. (The same could be said for the  application process  in general.) Reflecting on yourself beforehand helps a lot. It gets you in the mindset of thinking about what things matter most to you and what anecdotes within your life experiences you would like to share. You might also want to think about questions that are likely to come up, such as a brief introduction about yourself, why you’re interested in MIT, etc. 3b. Okay I hear you, but I am still really stressed and what if I completely fail it?? We are looking at everything in the context of your application so even if you feel like you bombed it, we will understand if you just had a bad day, particularly if the rest of your application says otherwise. Actual humans are reading your application, so we get
 
it ⁠ 01 I've definitely had my share of bad interviews... As mentioned in  this post  (which I also linked above), we sometimes tend to be our own worst critics, so the EC probably didn’t think it went as badly as you think it did. They’re rooting for you too. As long as you’re being respectful and are trying to add to the conversation, it’ll be alright. Take some deep breaths and watch some  bunny flops  to destress. Concluding thoughts To put your mind to ease, I wanted to share something that a current MIT student said about his own interview: “I really enjoyed my interview, and I found my interview to be the most influential part of the admissions process…I remember loving the opportunity to talk to someone from the school I wanted to attend, in essentially a very informal way. I was scared out of my mind going into the interview, but probably within 10 minutes I was completely comfortable. The interview lasted for 2 hours and I left it disappointed it had to end. I say again and again how to me MIT is all about the people, and the interview is the one opportunity applicants have to experience that first hand. That’s why I consider them so so important to the application. Not just because it gives us the chance to see an applicant’s personality and views and get to know THEM on a more personal level, but also because it gives the applicants the chance to see who we are as MIT.” Now go forth with all this knowledge as you embark on interviews this week, month, or in the near future. A big thank you as well to all the ECs for conducting these interviews, and to you all for being your awesome selves whose stories we get to read.

we fell in love in october that’s why i love fall looking at the stars admiring from afar (to properly credit “we fell in love in october” by girl in red as the reference for this blog’s title) Between the climate-change-aggravated heat of summer and the depressingly long winter that numbs both fingers and souls alike, we only get a few short weeks of fall. It’s so beautiful though. I love this time of the year when trees take on the color of sunlight and fire, blue skies blow friendly breezes, and  bears get really really fat .  Previous Next While I’ve always enjoyed fall, I’ve never felt so much joy from a season, a mere period of time defined by weather patterns, until  this  fall. Maybe it’s because this is only the second fall I’ve spent in a place with real seasons. Or that every other club event has been offering free cider donuts to lure in a special breed of raccoons called MIT students.  As fallen leaves start to blanket sidewalks, I’m reminded that a different kind of season defined by academic patterns,  midterm  season, is also upon us. But only one of my classes this semester has midterms or even just tests of any kind. My single midterm came and went, an insignificant blip in my days of apple cider and flannel jackets.  So the biggest reason why I’ve become such a sucker for fall? I’m the least hosed I’ve ever been! Most notably, I’ve defeated my previous record of taking 1 HASS in a semester by taking
 
3 HASSes ⁠ 01 21W.762 Poetry Workshop, 21W.744 Art of Comic Writing, 9.85 Infant & Early Childhood Cognition I love how I have free time to listen in on random seminars and take the longer route home. Most importantly, I have the headspace to just enjoy the sights and sounds of fall. There are moments where I feel like I’m living within a lofi album cover, where everything is saturated and the world feels surreal in a wonderful way.  Perhaps this blog is giving too much  Christian Girl Autumn , but I’m just proud of myself for finding childlike happiness in pretty leaves and decent weather. Enjoying fall, and enjoying life more in general, feels like a big step forward in undoing last year’s burnout. With that being said, I am hoping with my entire heart and jar of vitamin D pills that writing this blog won’t jinx my mood when the sun starts setting at 5pm.  I recognize that if you’re a high school senior reading this, you’re probably neck deep in the spooky swamp of college apps. Or blissfully procrastinating; I’m not here to judge. With early deadlines coming up, I hope you can find time between cursing essays that refuse to magically write themselves to do things that bring you joy and relaxation. Go outside! Bake a pie!  Bake a grape ! Fall might look different between where you currently live and where you’ll be in a year, so try to give this fall a bit of extra love <3 shoutout to Teresa’s emotional support stick Paul! I love fall and I also love Paul #fall foliage

Bonus: 3.091 (Solid-State Chemistry) class has a weekly meme contest. Because I’m a try hard and didn’t know how to make proper memes, I drew a comic. The topic was on orbitals and hybridization. I really like it, so I’m going to spew it here onto the internet. #comic

there are two popular approaches to moving a cart. the first one is to stand behind the cart and push it in the direction you want to go: the second is to stand in front of the cart and pull it such that it trails behind you: people usually default to pushing rather than pulling. the muscle groups involved in pushing are naturally stronger than the ones involved in pulling, it’s easier to maintain good posture, and pushing allows you to keep an eye on both the cart and the direction of travel. most of the time, pushing is the correct choice the fundamental assumption in pushing is that a force applied in some direction will result in movement in that direction. you tell yourself,  if i plan for the cart to move forward then the cart will move forward . you tell yourself,  i believe the cart will move straight, even though i am standing behind the cart and haven’t yet traversed the territory the cart will traverse.  you tell yourself,  if i push in a direction that looks appealing i will surely end up in a location that i like you tell yourself,  if i choose this city i’ll be next to these friends, if i choose this company i’ll work on these problems, if i choose this hobby i’ll spend my free time on these activities, and since i like these friends and these problems and these activities i will choose to move to this city and work at this company and dive into these hobbies but what if your cart wheels are worn out and difficult to adjust? what if the road your cart travels on is irregular and uneven? if you’ve ever pushed an old cart along a bumpy sidewalk, you know what happens – you try to push the cart in a straight line, but at the slightest bump in the road your wheels shift and you begin swerving to the left or the right. you can try to adjust the cart so that it’s pointing forwards again but the wheels are old so you can’t really turn the cart as well as you’d like to, and you end up having to correct your course constantly the issue with forward simulation is that the world is hopelessly chaotic, chaotic to the point that sometimes you can’t push a cart down the sidewalk in a straight line. you can set off in the right directions and end up stuck in a place much worse than where you started. you can get all the things you thought you wanted – the right school, the right career, the right partner – only to realize much later that you have become dull and jaded and exhausted, that you have been changed forever and can never return to where you were before of course, if your cart is bad enough or your road is turbulent enough then no approach, push or pull, will be of much use. pulling isn’t a cure-all for the pitfalls of pushing; it only provides a slightly more reliable solution the fundamental assumption in pulling is that everything else will work itself out as long as you dictate the path of your cart handle. when you pull the cart, you force the cart’s handle (or whatever other part of the cart you’re holding) to follow the same path as your body, but you don’t actually constrain the direction or exact motion of the rest of the cart. it’s fine if the cart hits a bump in the road and tilts to the left slightly, because that deviation will almost surely be corrected by another deviation to the right later on, and this ultimately is why pulling allows you to traverse bumpier roads with worse carts than pushing does this illustrates one of the main differences between pushing and pulling – that pushing tries to control the motion of the entire cart, while pulling only controls the motion of a portion of the cart. the other primary difference is that pushing involves standing behind the cart, while pulling involves standing in front of the cart. as a result pulling avoids the problem of forward simulation; you do not need to think too hard about trying to forecast the future because the cart is traversing a familiar territory rather than an unknown one as you’ve probably inferred by now, i no longer believe in the value of using simple external metrics to make important personal decisions. for instance: many people agree that it’s not a great idea to choose a job solely based on salary; i would argue that choosing a job based on eg. how many of your friends work there or what the work-life balance is similarly misses the point. we feel worse about choosing based on money than we do about choosing based on friends because of social stigmas related to money and greed, but choosing a job based on friends doesn’t actually change the fact that you’re using an easily verifiable benchmark to avoid thinking hard about what you really want the central problem with pushing is that, when fixating on the next shiny stage of life to push towards, we forget to consider how we will change throughout the process of pushing. the central premise of pulling is to start with a general vision of who you want to be, and to force yourself along the high-level path while letting all the other details fall into place the other day my friend told me they were stuck on deciding whether to work at a startup or go into finance or apply to grad school. i suggested that they describe what their ideal future self looked like – only personality traits and qualitative characteristics, nothing quantitative. they listed a few things they wanted for their future, and then said  “wait, why am i considering finance again? it helps me get literally none of these things”  i suspect that if you asked every college student to go through the same exercise, most of them, myself included, would realize many of the options they’re considering are wholly irrelevant a few posts ago i mentioned nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence. it’s usually framed in the context of evaluating your entire life – would you feel excitement or disgust if someone told you that you had to relive your life repeatedly? but lately i’ve been thinking about recurrence more in the context of specific moments. i sift through all the feelings i’ve ever had, and think about whether i’d want to feel each one day in and day out. how can i move my cart towards a future where i experience joy and fulfillment and wonder, over and over again?

One of the interesting things that I do as a commonplace concert goer that non-concert goers may never understand is waiting. I wait in line, a LOT. Just as you would wait at Disneyland for two and a half hours to ride on Space Mountain, I wait for 8-12 hours to get front row at a concert. Concerts typically sell general admissions tickets, alternately known as “pit tickets.” These tickets are usually all standing room and first come first serve, meaning the earlier you get there, the better view you will get. I’m writing a separate blogpost on my tips and tricks to getting a good view, but I thought I’d compile a list of my GA concerts and how long I waited to get that spot. It’ll be the artist, the date, the time I arrived, and the wait time total – the amount of time that passes from when I arrive to when the first opener performs. I went to this concert with my friend Val G. ’24 and she arrived at the line at around 9am. I took over her spot at around 11am since she had lab throughout the day, so I sat there until the concert opened doors at 7pm. This was pretty lucky. I bought 5sos tickets from StubHub maybe two months before, but come the day of the concert, they were never delivered. I called StubHub to ask when they would arrive but they said there was nothing they could do, so I luckily found replacement pit tickets for $80 online and I called an Uber and went.  I was really nervous I wasn’t going to be able to get a good view since I left and arrived so late, but I was pleasantly surprised to be around 4th row in GA pit for 5sos. I hypothesize this happened because the concert was somewhat out of the way (it wasn’t in San Francisco proper, it was in Concord). This was once again pretty lucky. I showed up right when doors opened and ended up 4th row. I anticipated that COIN wasn’t SUPER popular yet so I didn’t have to show up ridiculously early, and I was also okay with not being close. So I felt very lucky that I was able to be so close! This one was interesting because I DEFINITELY should’ve been closer (I was about 25th in line) but because VIP tickets were let in an hour before regular tickets, the first three rows were VIP people who arrived thirty minutes before the concert. Still a great view. This was the only time I’ve ever camped out over night for a concert and I slept on the streets of the Staples Center for this. It was TOTALLY worth it. I knew BTS was so popular and even arriving 25 hours in advance, we were 435th in line. But because Staples Center is so big, we were able to still snag a spot in the front row. 
Once again, I showed up right at doors opened since I (1) didn’t care about being that close and (2) didn’t anticipate people relentlessly camping out for Beach Bunny. I was able to wiggle through the crowd to be this close.

I originally registered for 60 units of classes this semester: 18.701: Algebra I 18.404: Theory of Computation 18.905: Algebraic Topology I  6.006(6.1210): Introduction to Algorithms  21W.771: Advanced Poetry Workshop  After meeting with my advisor, we agreed that I would take three of the four technical classes I had picked out or put one of them on Listener. I registered full time for all four, half convinced I would drop the class I liked the least but mostly because I wanted to take all of these classes. 6.006 was my droppable class. I was skeptical because I don’t like big class sizes and I did not have a great experience in
 
6.009(6.1010), ⁠ 01 Fundamentals of Programming In the time between registration and now, I also added
 
Undergraduate Teaching Seminar ⁠ 02 a class for first time teaching assistants in ESG(the Experimental Study Group, a first year learning community). I am TAing Differential Equations this semester, so I have to take the seminar 
Undergraduate Practice Opportunity Program. ⁠ 03 a career development program for sophomores to help with resume writing, applying to internships, etc. and provide a framework of support It turned out that three of the classes had problem sets due every two weeks, but on the same Thursday. 18.701 has weekly problem sets due midnight on Wednesdays so every other week, I had 4 problem sets due in a 24 hour period. Every time, I planned to schedule my time well and every time, I failed.  I had not been particularly enjoying the way 6.006 is taught and was seriously considering dropping it. At brunch on Saturday last week, I decided I would put 6.006 on Listener. One of the main motivations was that I didn’t think I knew too many people taking that class and I didn’t like the way the office hours were structured either. The last time I went, there weren’t enough TAs for the number of people there and I wasn’t able to get any help or ask any of the questions I had. But when Feli X. ’25 told me she was also in the class, I was motivated again to not drop it. I worked on the problem set due that week with some friends and got about two thirds of it.  That Thursday, after coming back from
 
DormCon GBM, ⁠ 04 Dormitory Council. DormCon is to all dorms what dorm exec is to a single dorm. Every other week, we have General Body Meetings where all the dorm presidents give updates. I still plan to go to recitations because I really like our recitation leader and I have been learning a lot more in recitations than the lectures.  Here are my rambling thoughts on all the full time classes I am actively taking right now. I. 18.701: Algebra I This is the one class that I somewhat have to take. It is only offered in the fall and is one of the first classes in algebra so it is a prerequisite for a lot of other classes I want to take.  The
 
only group theory ⁠ 05 read: barely any 
18.901 ⁠ 06 Introduction to Topology The professor is a great instructor and the lectures are reasonably clear.  He occasionally gives applications of the concepts we are studying in non-mathematical contexts. Sometimes, this means a tangent about relativity or quasicrystals and other times, it means talking about  none pizza with left beef But, the problem sets are insane. There are weekly problem sets that have anywhere from 8 to 11 problems, some with subparts and all the problems are very difficult. At least for someone who is doing algebra for the first time, which is exactly the expected audience for an Algebra I class, the problem sets are very, very time consuming and overwhelming.  II. 18.905: Algebraic Topology I The instructor who is teaching the class is the same professor who taught me 18.901. He teaches really well, takes reasonable breaks for questions, is willing to meet outside of class and is very understanding if you are falling behind and need some extra time.  I hope to do more Algebraic Topology and this is a great foundational class for that. The content is complex and takes some getting used to but the pace is well calibrated so it is still very enjoyable. One of the great conversations I had this week while working on the problem set for this class with Misheel O. ’25 was whether tea is
 
homotopic ⁠ 07 two topological spaces are homotopic if there is a continuous way to deform one into the other 
quotient of tea by the actual tea leaves ⁠ 08 you could try to identify all the tea into one point or one particle of tea. Misheel thinks this would give you 'a black hole of tea.' I think the density doesn't matter, at least topologically. III. 18.404: Theory of Computation The instructor for this class is also really good! He goes over the content slowly and relatively clearly. I have not had to interact with him much outside of class though. The recitations are very helpful. We go over some problems related to the content covered in class, which helps when solving the problem sets. The content for this class is also interesting. I have not done anything related to theory of computation before and pretty much everything is new to me so the slow pace of the class works great for me.  IV. 21W.771: Advanced Poetry Workshop I took
 
21W.762 ⁠ 09 Poetry Workshop During the first class, the professor made us translate a poem from Japanese essentially based on the ~vibes~ of a poetry reading. The funny thing is nearly everyone got the tone right. She also gave us half an hour to go somewhere outside and write some
 
tankas ⁠ 10 a Japanese poetry form, slightly longer than a haiku, with 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern There is more focused and detailed criticism in this class than in poetry workshop which I find very helpful. It helps to come detached from your work so you can consider everyone’s thoughts more objectively but that is obviously hard to do.  #18.404 Theory of Computation #18.701 Algebra I #18.905 Algebraic Topology #21W.762 Poetry Workshop #21W.771 Advanced Poetry Workshop #6.006 #classes

This is a guest post by Sara M. ’24, our lovely dorm VP, who did a better job eulogizing the Milk than I ever could. If you’re a milk-enjoyer, please take a moment to think of our beloved Milk as you drink your own Milk in the bottom of your cereal bowl, mug, or biohazard bin. The annual return to Random Hall began slowly. First came those who lived in MIT housing over the summer, trickling in from EC and MacGregor on August 13th. Then came the Friendly Neighborhood Upperclassmen: the peer mentors, the desk workers, the government, and the like. Last but not least of the early returns, the backbone of society: the REX volunteers.  The first frosh arrived on August 19th. The last upperclassmen trickled in on September 6th, the day before classes began.  This is the first fall in three years that the reopening could be considered even remotely normal. Random Hall, for another year, was back in its full music-blasting and food-producing chaotic swing of things. We were – we  are  – so happy to be back home.  But all is not well. We hadn’t been in the dorm for more than a week before we began to notice that some crucial items had gone missing over the summer. Half of Foo’s murals were painted over in Institute white. Black Hole’s Goldberg-like light switch is missing. Ninety percent of the entire dorm’s baking pans are gone.  Most distressingly: no one could find the Milk.  For those of you who may be unaware, allow me to provide a brief backstory. Before the Milk was a name and cultural presence on the east side, it was merely a carton of milk, brought home from the store by a lactose-intolerant Bonfire resident eager to make mac and cheese. In a tale familiar to us all, the Randomite had forgotten to purchase the mac and cheese mix itself. Thus, the milk sat. In the fridge. For months, long past its October 20, 1994 expiration date. No one else used it, as they hadn’t purchased it. The purchaser didn’t use it, as they were lactose intolerant and didn’t recall having any reason to own milk.  Whether by chance or on purpose, the Milk was never consumed, nor was it tossed out. (A too-fitting physical representation of the busyness of life as an MIT undergrad, I believe.) The Milk became a staple good – not of someone’s forgone mac and cheese, but of Random Hall.  Eventually, the Milk began to stink. It gained a secondary container, and a warning label. At some point it migrated from Bonfire to Pecker, where it remained for the rest of its days. Legend tells of a phase in the Milk’s decomposition journey when it required periodic burping – that is, opening the container on the roofdeck for unseemly gases to escape, ideally without them escaping into the unlucky burp-ee’s face. The Milk had been stable for the past several years, residing in a cabinet or on top of a fridge, looking down on us all with judgement, and, I hope, affection.  Several Admissions blogs Last year, on October 20, 2021, we sang the Milk its birthday dirge. We reminisced about the origin of the Milk, telling stories passed down over the years. Someone mentioned that, save the GRAs and Heads of House, the Milk was five or so years older than all current Randomites. The Milk sat on the middle of the Pecker kitchen tables, photographed and praised all night long, before returning to its over-sink residence.  Little did we know, that would be the last time we had the honor of celebrating the Milk’s expiration date.  The fall 2022 search for the Milk began accidentally. The residents of Pecker, freshly off planes and trains and automobiles, unpacked their bins of spices and unholy amounts of flour, steering the kitchen back into the familiar beautiful disarray that had been corrected over the summer. In doing so, one Peckerite must have opened the doors to the stout cabinet above the sink. Perhaps they were looking for the Milk. Perhaps they were seeing if our missing baking sheets had been stashed up there. Perhaps they were doing nothing in particular.  Regardless, they found nothing. The Milk was declared missing on August 20th, 2022.  The Milk is not an easy object to mistake for something good and normal. Wrapped in a faded orange warning label proclaiming it “Flammable Liquid,” the clear cylindrical twist-top container occupied by a vintage milk carton and several inches of mysterious grayish-brown liquid may not look like something of value to unkind observers. But, we logicked, the warning label and attached note proclaiming it “The Milk” also made it clear that this object is not trash. It was clear that somebody cared.  Once all the Pecker residents returned and confirmed that none of them had moved the Milk away from its usual year-round hiding spot, the alarm was sounded. Cruft from last year were contacted in an attempt to determine when and where it had last been seen. The GRAs and Heads of House were roped in. Our new House Manager was alerted, and our very lovely maintenance workers helped us search every nook and cranny of the building. The dorm’s extended mailing list of over 300 current students, alumni, and other assorted Random-adjacent humans was contacted, twice.  In the end, no Milk.  Theories have sprung up regarding what happened. Maybe non-Randomite summer residents took the Milk, or disposed of it in some cruel prank. Or, perhaps it was the change in House Mangers; the switch created lots of chaos, its reasonable to add a miscommunication resulting in the destruction of the Milk to the list.  Most likely it was a cleaner, a contract worker, or another welcome visitor, innocently doing their job and trying to make the dorm a neater place who happened upon a presumed dairy-based disaster, not knowing it had greater meaning.  We don’t truly blame those responsible, whoever they may be. The Milk was bound to go eventually. We’re just sad that it was so soon, when the dear Milk had so much life left to live.  Hope remains, stubborn and ill-advised. Surely not every cabinet has been searched and every floorboard upturned. Perhaps someone took it for safekeeping, or some other indiscernible reason, and is yet to check “return the Milk” off their doubtlessly overflowing to-do list. It’s not over until it’s over.  Nevertheless, we must sooth our wounds, and move forward in dignity. It is in this spirit that we resign to the fact that, after five months of no contact, the Milk is quite likely no longer with us.  The story of the Milk will live on, preserved as a Random folklegend and on the depths of the internet. A memorial for the Milk is in the works. Whispers float down the stairwell – maybe, just maybe, the Milk will soon have a long-awaited sibling. As much as the community would welcome a new Milk, nothing could possibly replace the wonder of the original.  Every evening on October 20th for the past 28 years – over eight generations of Randomites – we’ve dirged or otherwise honored the Milk to celebrate it growing another year older.  This year, Random Hall will stand in silence.

In case you haven’t heard,  MIT has a new president-elect What could I say to that? Within 15 minutes I had begged another TA to switch recitation spots with me and confirmed my attendance. My attendance at   I did not know. At 7 pm yesterday, we received an email letting us know that the event would be to announce MIT’s 18th president!!! The email was understandably but delightfully cryptic, avoiding all pronouns and listing the “who” as “ 18 president I showed up at the Welcome Center this morning at 9.45 am sharp, the arrival time for “press planning to attend in person.” I was now press! I straightened my coat and tried to look cool. It probably failed, considering I was the only person there holding a backpack and a bike helmet. I checked out the food table and took a pastry from possibly the fanciest snack platter I’ve ever seen. Soon it was time to file in and take our seats in
 
the auditorium. ⁠ 01 If you've ever attended an info session in the new Welcome Center, you've sat in the very same seats! We all burst out clapping. The atmosphere in the room was electric. (MIT confession: I was going to make a comparison to the announcement of a new iPhone, but then I thought, maybe not everyone would be as honoured as me to be compared to an iPhone. 😳) Next, the chair of
 
the MIT corporation ⁠ 02 Basically the board of directors Anyone who knows me won’t be surprised to hear that my hand shot up first. I asked about students, of course (I almost felt contractually obligated to). It was awesome to hear her say that she wanted to meet with students and hear from us — and that she liked the rollercoasters we build. After my question they took one from MIT News and then one from the New York Times, so I’m basically a crucial pillar of American journalism now (you heard it here first!) After the Q&A period, there was time set aside for journalists to speak individually with Dr. Kornbluth. In our brief conversation, we talked about how it can be difficult to move from one institution to another when each school has its own particular culture, and the importance of listening to and building trust with those you’re hired to serve. I was really happy to hear that she plans to be open and responsive to student feedback. She joked that hopefully she’ll be able to hear from us before it gets to the picket line point; I told her that MIT students will express their concerns in any avenue you give them, office hours or picket line. Then I had to go: it was time to teach my 11 am recitation, so I grabbed my bike helmet and said my goodbyes. Just another day in the life of a student, amirite? It was such an honour to be able to meet and talk with Dr. Kornbluth today and hear about her plans for her new role as our 18th president, and I’m really grateful to the MIT News office for giving the admissions blogs the chance to attend. (This is probably the most irreverent article that will be written using the press kit they sent us, so I hope they don’t regret it!) She officially takes office in January. I’m excited to see what she does :)

I once asked a boyfriend if he would give up his life for ten billion dollars. “Yes,” he said. “Because the amount of good I can do in my lifetime is probably not worth ten billion dollars, so it would be better for me to just die and donate all of that.” I then asked my brother the same question. “No,” he responded. “Like, I also don’t believe the amount of good I can do in my lifetime is worth ten billion dollars, but I care about my own life too much, so I’ll just admittedly choose the option that isn’t utilitarian.” Speaking rationally, my brother would be making the morally wrong choice. But how can anyone truly blame him for it? Back in May, Olivia Rodrigo came to Boston on her  tour. The online ticketing system was a mess: Olivia wasn’t performing at a large arena, but rather a smaller, standing-room-only venue, and this was her only performance in all of New England. In the days before sales opened, social media was alight with chatter: it was obviously going to be a vicious battle for tickets. Olivia was a teenage wunderkind who had somehow managed to strike something intimate in everyone. I was hesitant to attend the concert, as it was the day before my midterm, but I had the entire  album memorized. My friend Tiffany T. ’22 miraculously snagged us four tickets at face value, but then she fell sick several days beforehand and wasn’t able to go. I texted her the day of the concert.  she said, and then she told me how much she’d resold it for: over ten times what she had paid for it. That . . . was a lot of money. I did some calculations in my head. The benefit I’d get from attending the concert was reduced, since Tiffany was no longer able to make it, and part of the reason why I wanted to go was to hang out with her. The risk seemed larger, since I was becoming more worried about COVID and didn’t want to catch it right before finals. And the benefit of selling my ticket was now increased, since I hadn’t expected the resale value to be so high. So, while I was sitting in office hours, I sold the Olivia Rodrigo ticket, twenty minutes before sales closed, since my ticket would become nontransferable four hours before the start of the performance. Afterwards, I explained to another group of friends, “It would be like paying that much money to attend the concert. And I wouldn’t be willing to pay it, so I had to sell the ticket.” They nodded. “That’s very rational of you,” one of them said. I got the feeling he was teasing me. It  the rational decision, right? But I knew that I hadn’t accounted for everything. Yes, there was the money, but there was also the value of spending an evening with my other two friends who were still able to go, and the value of not letting them down; there was the feeling of being young and surrounded by magic; there was the inevitable march of time, how I could probably see Olivia again in the future but it wouldn’t be quite the same. I couldn’t quantify any of these things meaningfully. But to deny their significance, to only focus on the measurable aspects of the decision, that didn’t seem correct either. This sort of thinking is the kind I’ve only learned to do in the last several years. Growing up, I didn’t approach my decisions as some math problem modeling the world. I had a vague goal and some immediate desires and then I did stuff based on what I wanted short-term and what I wanted long-term. It was only after I got to MIT that I started framing my decisions around expected value, variance, risks and benefits. I can’t pinpoint a single instance that propelled me to do this. But I was tired of my own poor decision-making, which had led me to stay too long in mediocre relationships and take risks that weren’t worth the upside and invest time in activities that weren’t benefitting me. And I was surrounded by math majors. A few days ago (to clarify,   as of the moment I am drafting this blog post; because I made the observation that my time at the beginning of the semester is less precious than the time in the middle, I pen this on September 8th but intend to publish on October 20th. Again, a decision that prioritizes measurable factors and ignores things like the instant gratification I receive from publishing as soon as I generate the last syllable of this post), two of my friends were talking about where we should allocate money to do the most good. One of them proposed bike lanes in Cambridge, which would likely prevent some deaths or injuries and also make the city more pleasant overall. “If we want to be doing the most good, we should probably donate our money to malaria prevention,” I said. Then I opened GiveWell.org and showed it to my friends, explaining that this was a website that optimized for impact and, since our dollars would go a much longer way in some other countries vs. the United States, by donating the same amount, we would be making much more of an impact. This was something I had learned about from the time I had spent in an Effective Altruism fellowship. Effective Altruism is, according to Wikipedia, “a philosophical and social movement that advocates ‘using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.'” Honestly, I didn’t go to that many of the meetings, nor did I find the time to read the free books that they had sent me, although they look interesting and I would one day like to read them. “But donating to malaria prevention doesn’t account for everything, right?” I continued. “Like, it probably personally benefits me more to have nice bike lanes in Cambridge than to improve the lives of some people I would never meet. I am more emotionally invested in the members of my own community. If I were purely rational, I would weigh everyone’s lives equally.” (I internally cringed at the last sentence, because when I hear people describe themselves as  it has usually been from a man trying to undermine the experiences of a woman and not being rational at all, just sexist.) But I don’t think it should be a foregone conclusion, that we should act as entirely rational agents. It is not bad to rely on emotional epistemology. It  to me that nice bike lanes mean that I, and other college students like me, run less risk of getting hit by a car while cycling, even if the amount of money spent on this project could have been spent on saving more lives from a higher-risk threat. I saw a Reddit screenshot a while ago about a high-earning software engineer who paid someone to clean his apartment, someone to wash his clothes, someone to cook for him . . . it made sense, right? His time was valuable and his money was abundant. But what amount of his own life was he actually living? That’s the real problem, isn’t it? So much of life is about that which is unquantifiable. I can pay a nanny to take care of my screaming kid, but will I be missing out on the immeasurable fulfillment and joy that comes from raising a child? I can donate money to a faraway organization instead of one in my own community, but then will I be depriving myself of the satisfaction that comes from uplifting those around me? Aren’t these feelings and experiences the ones that make life so incredible, not the rational knowledge that I have helped save some number of people? But that’s, of course, not to say that it’s bad to quantify things and act rationally, against my emotional interests. When I sold that Olivia Rodrigo concert ticket, I made the correct financial choice for myself, even if my heart yearned to hear her sing  onstage. My heart often wants frivolous or unhelpful things. It’s usually best to ignore it. As I move forward and am required to make more and more decisions with higher stakes and longer-lasting consequences, I’m not sure how to reconcile these two modes of thinking. I’m not sure if anybody has figured out a decision-making framework that truly accommodates all the nuances of living (if you know of one, please tell me!). Maybe we are all just stumbling in the dark, or as Nick Carraway once said:  .

i don’t care about things any more. all these student groups i’m a part of, like tech squares or the assassins guild or esp or puzzle club or sipb? i used to care about them more. i wanted to fight for their existence, to make sure they kept going another year, and for more years after that, because i wanted other people to experience the joys that i did. i wanted people to discover how cool square dancing is. i wanted to give students who’ve never touched a nerf gun before the opportunity to shoot one. i wanted to give middle school and high school students a chance to go to programs and take silly hour-long classes about fandoms or quantum mechanics. it’s not that i don’t want these things any more, but i don’t care about them enough. i used to care about floorpi, and east campus. i cared about east side culture. i cared that undergrads could paint murals in their dorm hallways and build rollercoasters in their courtyards and get funding to throw parties at not-frats every week. i cared that east campus had a hall that felt like mine, one with two shelves filled with board games and people who liked playing them. i talk to alumni about these things. how’s east campus these days? or, what’s going on with mystery hunt? they’d ask. i have a friend who used to live on floorpi, and he always asks me about it, and i tell him it’s not the same any more. he’s always sad hearing that. he said he wants others to call floorpi home, like he did years ago when he lived in floorpi. i tell him about how the culture and traditions fade more with each year, with nothing new coming up to replace them. he says that’s sad. whenever we talk about the topic, all he says is that it’s sad. maybe i’m old. maybe these things don’t feel as new and colorful as they once did, to the wide-eyed first-year moving to a new country. maybe that’s why i leave meetings early and don’t sign up for games. i’ve been getting burnt out by many things, these days, whether it’s writing blog posts or talking to friends or walking outside. maybe it’s not surprising that i care less. maybe it’s more than that? it used to be   to care about these things. it felt like i was making a difference. by being president of this student group, maybe i could push for it to live a year longer. if i could recruit other people, get them to run for officership, get them to see my vision, maybe it’d last a few more months. by being hall chair, by running events, by pushing people to do things, i could keep the traditions going. i’ve done all these things, and more. it never works as well as i want it to. it’s not like homework, where i know if i put in enough hours, i can do it. if i ask the right people for help, i can do it. it’s not like homework where people actively   me to succeed, because of course your professor wants you to pass your class, of course your advisor wants you to graduate. i’m in an institution that’s dedicated to student learning— i’m not in an institution that’s dedicated to student life. in the end, mit has no obligation to the things i love. if tomorrow all east side dorms disappeared, and all student groups disappeared, then what does it matter if hundreds of years of history, tradition, and culture disappear with them? what does it matter if the students complain, as long as they study graduate and do research and donate? it used to be fun to care. but now everything i do feels like punching air. i can punch harder, but i’ll only get tired faster. and i’m tired. this year i will leave mit, like many of my friends before me. and while i can still care about these things even when i’m gone, what’s the point? i’ll be gone. i won’t be able to do anything about these things, nor can i participate in them. it’s always been easier not to care, to be apathetic. why bother with activism and lobbying and   when it won’t make a difference to me in a year? some part of me still cares. not enough to do more, but enough to hope that someone else will care. that someone will keep punching and keep fighting. if i want all these things i love to survive, then someone’s gotta do it… but it won’t be me.

Are you an MIT student who can’t get in on the October fun because you’re drowning in problem sets? Is midterm season killing your Halloween vibe? No problem! Here are five costumes ideas that’ll get you inspired for a spoOOoky time at MIT! Tired of spelling “Massachusetts”? This is just the costume for you!  It’s an easy costume to pull off when you promised your friends you’d tag along with them for some Halloween shenanigans, but you procrastinated on what you’d wear to the last minute.  Could be a challenge if you don’t know any other places that aren’t Massachusetts. Show some love for one of the most notable landmarks on campus. You’ll look just like the  actual thing The numbers and math jargon really scream “MIT.” Show off that school pride! Whether it’s a scream of joy or anguish is a different question.) We’re a few months ahead of the annual  Integration Bee  about it.  When the champion of the Integration Bee gets awarded the title of “Grand Integrator,” you get to go up to them and say, “Boy, that really was the bee’s knees!” and then smear honey all over them.  Doing that might make people angry. This is for you Greek mythology fans out there (with a fun Tech twist).  It’s unique! It’s bold! Is this not how Chiron, the wisest of the centaurs, would have wanted his legacy to be remembered among mankind?  Hard to clean. Banana Lounge Praise Bananacles, protector of free bananas that give us the strength to continue our day’s journey!  You have bananas on your head. Nothing can get better than that.  There are no cons. This is perfect.

Alan and I have been taking a class together this semester: 21W.740: Writing Autobiography and Biography. I really thought I would enjoy the class. This is due to a few reasons: Firstly , I have never had a semester at MIT where I  didn’t  want to be taking the classes I was taking. This is a somewhat privileged position to be in (and given some of those classes are GIRs, this may be somewhat shocking), and I had naively hoped that this streak would continue. Furthermore , I enjoyed the introductory version of this class,
 
21W.022. ⁠ 01 Writing and Experience: Reading and Writing Autobiography wasn’t  the five paragraph + thesis form. Sure, before this class I was blogging here and there, but I had never learned about this form of writing structurally, and  man  was this class a fun way to do so. Finally , this class seemed like the perfect opportunity to simply  write  more. Writing while at MIT has been exactly the right outlet to contemplate on my experiences here. I sit down, go to docs.new (the most useful website shortcut frankly), and put thought to (digital) paper. Before this semester, I was finding it very difficult to find the time to write though. This isn’t an anomaly, it’s hard to find time to do  anything 
extra ⁠ 02 i.e. non-academic, unpaid, etc. 
And yet, ⁠ 03 as you may have gathered by the use of past tense so far more  reasons: Firstly , Alan and I are currently the  only  ones taking the class. Alan is taking the class “tO gRaDUaTe”, so they can’t exactly just  drop  the class (nor do they particularly want to from what I gather), but for me it’s just a
 
HASS-A, ⁠ 04 arts graduation requirement plenty  of cool HASS-A’s available to take here. This might’ve been what the other students who started in the class thought too, because the class started with about ten people on the first day, then immediately became five by the next, then three, and now the class is just us two. Alan, Professor Ken Manning, and me. I didn’t particularly want to abandon them. Furthermore , I have already written about twenty pages for this class. In reality, this isn’t an insane amount, but other classes I’ve taken at MIT have had  at most  20 pages of writing, and those were for communication-intensive classes (CI-H’s). I’ve enjoyed writing these pages, but it feels like so much for (in my opinion) so little in return. I was hoping for a more personal writing workshop.  Finally , taking classes outside of your major/that don’t have problemsets due every week is a good way to help prevent burnout and introduces some variation in your life. Though in general, it’s a good idea to keep taking HASS classes, at least one per semester (though self-indulging in numerous HASSes can also be a fun time). This is as, to graduate, you need to take eight humanities courses. If you do the math, that’s at least one per semester of the traditional eight semesters in undergrad, so regularly taking at one isn’t the  worst  idea. This last point has been making me think about the mathematical proof strategy known as  The Pigeonhole Principle . The concept via an example: suppose you have thirteen friends. You would  then  know that at least two of them share the same birth month, as there are only twelve months in the year. Similarly, if you have 53 friends, you know that at least two of them share the same birth week. Or, if you have 367 friends (accounting for the leap year), then perhaps you have too many friends. You get the point: if you have more boxes (i.e. months/weeks) then you have pigeons to stuff into those boxes (i.e. friends), then at least two of those pigeons must share a box. Hence the phrase,
 
pigeonholing. ⁠ 05 was putting pigeons into holes really so important that it needed its own phrase in the English language? I digress. I have four semesters (including this one) left here at MIT, and I still have four HASS classes I need to take to graduate. If I don’t take one this semester, then at least two classes must happen during the same semester. This isn’t the  worst  thing– I don’t mean to imply that it is. There are plenty of fun, interesting HASS classes to take here, and plenty I want to take before I graduate. My point is: oh my god I’m running out of semesters to take classes at MIT. Soon, I will need a job, and an apartment, and to pay bills (though frankly every email I get from student financial services gives me a minor heart attack so that won’t be terribly new). Does this mean I should take a million classes so I don’t miss out on some cool class/opportunity? No, I don’t think so. If this was the case, then perhaps I wouldn’t have decided to drop the autobiographies class. But I did drop the class, for a few  more  reasons: Firstly , I just wasn’t enjoying it. Yes, it is a somewhat privileged position to be able to  only  take classes that you want to while at MIT, but this position is (for the most part) due to my own creation. I have actively scouted for classes with good evaluations and ones with material that sounds interesting to me, and have dropped a few classes early on which didn’t seem worth the effort. The autobiographies class was different in this regard. With math, unless it’s a seminar/topics class, most often classes will follow a specific book or will start from the ground up. The subject matter interested me immensely, but there are so many ways to teach a class like this, and as much as I liked Ken I didn’t like this approach to the class. Furthermore , I have  plenty  of reasons to write now. On the one hand, being a blogger pays off (literally and figuratively), and this was  just  enough incentive to start writing more regularly. In fact, I think since the semester started I’ve written a blogpost nearly weekly and my mental health has  drastically  improved. I’ve also been needing to spend more time reflecting on my time at MIT so far, and how I want to spend the upcoming time, and this sort of contemplation (for me) works best through writing things down. Finally , this semester more than ever before I have found myself with more extracurriculars than classes. I’m an undergraduate assistant for a class, I’m in the process of starting a math club, I’m blogging, I’m talking with professors more– I’m getting more out of MIT than classes. Sure classes at MIT are pigeonholing themselves into the (very few) semesters I have left here, but the real pigeonholing that is going on is  activities . There are only so many hours in the day (boxes), and there are so many activities I can be doing (pigeons). I look forward to seeing which pigeons I’m able to shove into boxes. P.S. Sorry for dropping the class Alan. #fun fact: my smash bros nickname is pigeon #math analogies #pigeons

Spoilers for  A Boring Friday  If you haven’t played the game enough, here’s three paths that let you read most of the text. Choices that aren’t listed don’t matter.  This is a choose your own adventure, where you play as me, running through the events of a Friday. The game starts at midnight and continues until dinner. The events in the game are pretty faithful to what I did on Friday, September 30, but I had to invent what happened in the branches I did not pick myself. Most of the story proceeds through a linear path: do some activities, go to sleep, go to Lobby 10, eat lunch, do something in the afternoon, eat dinner, then the ending. If it’s a linear path, then what use is there making choices? The answer is  delayed branching Classic CYOA books have a branching structure: each choice brings you down different paths that seldom merge again. Each choice is of equal significance, and there are many possible endings. The problem with this structure is that the choices tend to be ungrounded. You’ll see several “turn left or turn right?” choices, where the options are meaningless but lead to different realities. The delayed branching structure is more linear. It’s governed by the passage of time. In A Boring Friday you’re reminded of this by having the time repeated often: “it’s a little past Thursday midnight”, “it’s 10 AM.” It’s so linear that there’s only one ending, where after dinner, you reflect on how the day went. But there are variations on the ending sequence that depend on earlier choices. Your choices   matter, but their effects aren’t visible until the end.  The ending sequence depends on three factors. The first is the number of times the game has been played, which affects the response to the “is this the good ending?” question: Is this the end? Did you make the most out of today? Is this the “good ending”, or is there a better one?  You’re not sure. You don’t think you’ll ever find out.  You don’t think that there is. If there was, you would’ve seen it by now. isn’t* a good ending. Only different ones.  Your head hurts. You feel like you’ve asked this question before. The second is the number of times you looped through the afternoon activity. There’s three possible afternoon activities: writing a blog post, doing TA work, and playing a board game. Each has a similar structure, where there’s an option that repeats the passage, and an option that moves on: The number of times you loop the afternoon activity is recorded, and affects how you respond to Lumia when she asks you about how you’re feeling. The more times you loop, the more explicit the reference to your life feeling like it’s stuck in a loop. The third, and most impactful, is the number of social activities you do. There’s five choices that lead to social activities: going on a voice call, playing the Spelling Bee, going to the booth early, eating lunch with others, and playing a board game. Doing all five activities changes the response to the “is this the good ending?” question: Is this the end? Did you make the most out of today? Is this the “good ending”, or is there a better one? You spent today being around friends: on voice calls, sitting next to each other, eating lunch, playing board games. Maybe there’s not a good ending, but this is as good as it gets. And that’s fine. I’ll refer to this as the “alternate ending”, later on, even though it’s not much different from the other ways the ending could go.  Each afternoon activity touches on one of the game’s themes. First, let’s consider the blog post option. It poses the question of whether time you enjoy wasting is wasted time. Let’s consider two of the dinner branch exchanges. First is about YouTube: “Honestly, too much time on YouTube,” you say. “Well,” she says, “it’s not like you spent a whole day on it.” “Jeez, it might as well could’ve been. I feel pretty bad procrastinating.” The second is about Slay the Spire: “I’ve been playing a lot of Slay the Spire recently,” you say. “Oh,” she says. “I’ve been playing lots of Minecraft.” “Yeah, but you play Minecraft and   it. I honestly don’t know why I play Slay the Spire.” In the first quote, the character feels bad about wasting time. It’s time enjoyed wasting, but they feel guilty about it all the same. In the second quote, the character also wasted time playing a video game. This time they reveal that they didn’t enjoy it. It doesn’t follow the premise: if it’s not time enjoyed wasting, then the saying shouldn’t apply. My intent was that the character enjoyed neither YouTube nor the video games. This reflects my own experience. While I enjoy consuming media, I tend to fall into the trap of doing it when I have “nothing better to do”, even if I don’t enjoy it. My interpretation is that   is what wasted time is. Not watching YouTube or playing video games, but doing these things to distract myself from boredom, rather than because I genuinely enjoy them. The second option, the TA work, poses the question of whether any of your work matters. Right before this passage, the narrator asks a similar question, this time about whether any of your choices matter: You wonder what to do next. Do any of these choices matter? Thinking about this makes you existential, so you distract yourself by doing something else. I’ve talked a lot about the nature of choice in my posts. I think the structure of the game itself shows some of my thoughts about this. Your choices affect things, but no matter what, things will be okay. The third option, the board game, talks about time passing. “Time passes” is a motif in the game. It serves as the standard “continue” text on the bottom of passages without choices. Because it’s so standard, then, it almost turns invisible—up to the point where this option draws attention to it again. It’s a heavy-handed metaphor for how you don’t notice time passing until it’s gone. Another thing about time passing is how the afternoon loops affect the text. Looping is supposed to represent dwelling on something. By clicking the same option over and over, it shows how the dwelling turns thinking to worrying, making the text more negative. This feels kinda hypocritical as someone who thinks a lot about these existential kinds of things, but it reflects my own experience too—I can’t spend too long thinking about something, else I end up nowhere. As an aside, the way we describe time as something that   is an example of a  conceptual metaphor  is more common, I think   is my preferred metaphor. The future is   of you, the past is   you.  A big theme of the game is how important relationships are to the character. There’s narration that explicitly clues which kinds of things the character likes: You don’t hang out with [your friends] enough. You could be spending time with them right now, but you’re not. You wonder if you made the right decision. The meals you enjoy the most are the ones you share with friends. You wish you’d gone to lunch with Justin and Antonio and Sameer. These were all meant to nudge the player to choosing more social options, which is kind of the point, as that’s what leads to the biggest change to the ending. Like the character, I value being around my friends. That can be seeing them in person or not, but either way, I like being around them. There’s also a lot of musing about friendships. I think they’re all about the character trying to understand what having friends means, as an adult who won’t be in school any more. Here’s some text from a detail about Justin: Like many summer camp friendships, though, you haven’t talked as much after that summer ended. You both go to MIT now, but this is the first time you’re talking to him in what must be months. Is this what adult friendships are like? Months between without talking? It’s less direct, but the character wonders the same things about their friend groups, like the Discord server of friends or Galactic Trendsetters. How did they end up in these groups in the first place? Will they continue being in these groups after they graduate? And if so, does that mean they need to keep building their relationship with them? It’s funny how this online community developed. If it weren’t for them, you wouldn’t be studying here today. And on some days you remember that you owe your life to them, these twenty or so people. You’re grateful that you’re a part, but sometimes you wonder how things would’ve gone if you didn’t end up being friends with them. That’s the reason you chose New York, after all: you wanted to live near your friends. Not that you don’t have friends in the Bay Area, but they’ll be far away. You can’t bear living far from your friends.  One of the character’s doubts is about whether they’re “normal”. Part of you wonders if it’s bad that you have fun doing homework. Normal people don’t have fun doing work, right? Right? Too much [work], maybe? You don’t know. What do normal people do? You wouldn’t know. I included these thoughts because I thought players would relate to doubting whether they’re normal. This was something I wanted to give more resolution to, but kinda forgot, oops. I wanted to go for a “maybe it doesn’t matter if you’re normal or not”, but that didn’t get pursued further because I’d already crammed a lot of themes. Then there’s the kinda forced theme about feeling in control of your life. The dinner speech is taken almost verbatim from  Final Deployment 4: Queen Battle Walkthrough Sometimes, I do things I don’t wanna do, like I’m being controlled. I feel like, if life was a video game, maybe I don’t have a good player controlling me. I feel like a loser, but other times, I don’t know what to do. I wish I had someone controlling me, so I wouldn’t feel so lost. I don’t know what I want. All I know is, when I play video games, I feel like I have a purpose. Why can’t life have that? I chose to include it because I think more people should watch this video, but I was also surprised how suitable it was in this context. Here, the character isn’t in control of their choices; that’s the player’s job. Yet in a sense, these games are usually presented as if the player   the character, and so the character   making their own choices. It’s neat because I’m violating the implicit expectation that the player doesn’t exist, by making the character doubt whether their choices are theirs. This is what TV Tropes would call  Leaning on the Fourth Wall  I want to end with some narrative theory. I’m taking 21W.765 Interactive Narrative, which is part of what inspired me to make this in the first place (and what’s inspiring me to write this analysis). Here, I think it’s important to distinguish between four different people: , or  , the person who wrote the work; , or  , the person who interacts with the work; , the person acting inside the work; , the voice describing what the character does. Here, it’s almost like these four identities are the same, but they aren’t. As the author, I’m not exactly the character. The character represents me, but they might’ve done different things on that Friday than I did. Indeed, in the alternate ending, which is perhaps the most “canonical” one, the character went to the booth early, but I did not. The character also isn’t the narrator. The narrator refers to the character as “you”, for one. The narrator isn’t me either, but a character I wrote. And the player isn’t the character, even though it may seem that way at first. The use of “you” through the story makes it seem like it is, up until the end where it’s revealed that the character’s choices and the player’s choices are related, but different. I dunno, I find this fun to think about.

MIT: REGRESSIONS Upon its May 1st release,  had a tremendous impact across campus. Understanding the historical forces that shape the institutions we have today is monumental in viewing MIT with more nuance, and I noticed students in my periphery taking more ownership over their student experience. Seeing how past students at the Institute engaged with campus and the world made us feel impassioned about changing aspects of student life we aren’t satisfied with, driving us to realize that we don’t have to embrace current norms as the default. This school is constantly evolving, and as it stands, students have the power to make their voices heard in a way that benefits communities both local and global. All it takes is awareness and the desire to enact change. MIT has long promised to engineer a better world. This film asks a simple question: Have we kept our promise? Regressions was inspired by the documentary  , created by BBC journalist Adam Curtis. While on a gap year due to COVID-19, Luke came across the film and was struck by its breadth of archival footage covering decades of American and British history. Using footage of MIT, he created a two minute parody and showed it to his friend Wesley, who immediately wanted to write a script for it. They added narration, and the more footage they uncovered, the longer the script became, eventually reaching 100 pages and spanning eight decades. wes and luke, both phi kappa theta ’22s To make the movie, they went decade by decade, searching through all existing archival footage and poring over hundreds of hours of content. Since this was during the pandemic, they didn’t have access to MIT’s libraries and a lot of their footage was low quality. This spurred them to build an AI enhancement tool to colorize and upscale it. In making Regressions, Wes and Luke found inspiration in past documentaries about MIT.
 
A 1969 film called  ⁠ 01 shoutout to the amazing archival detective work of undergrad Kenny Friedman '17 They also used a film called   from 1934, and   from 1992. Strangely enough, a film about MIT seems to be made every two decades. It seems only fitting that   comes in 2022, in the wake of immense social change caused in part by the pandemic. Finding and putting together 80 years of footage is already a colossal task, but curating a fitting soundtrack is even more challenging. Wes and Luke did a phenomenal job—I can’t count the number of times I got chills, or that the room   was streamed in became deathly quiet following a poignant musical moment. The intro song,

A particularly memorable moment was   in the background of a compilation of footage of my dorm. My floor has played that song non-stop since my freshman year, so it has a special significance to me, and hearing it alongside imagery of the dorm I love made me emotional. It’s a silly college song, but it reminds me of people I love and moments I cherish, and the energy captured in the   clips felt all-too familiar. Regressions spans dozens of threads, including MIT’s relationship with military research and the government, its presidents and leadership, its role in shaping Cambridge history, and its immense contributions to humanity. Luke and Wes planned to explore MIT’s involvement with the military from the beginning, and everything else came naturally from the footage they encountered. The result is a 3.5 hour film that delves into a different theme in each decade, painting a picture of MIT that resonates with students while presenting the institute they know and love in a completely new light. It’s incredible, and in my eyes, essential. regressions posters in the infinite corridor an Instagram  project. In all my social circles, people were talking about the film, making predictions on what it would say about MIT and how positive or negative it would be. 
Lecture Series Committee ⁠ 03 an 80-year old organization that hosts movies and screenings in 26-100 every weekend during the school year some of my living community at the screening (featuring a slightly obscured me) . Overwhelmingly, I was struck by how alien MIT seemed, especially in earlier decades. The film examines MIT from a viewpoint distinct from what we see in popular culture, so a lot of information was new to me. I wasn’t expecting to know so little about the history of the Institute, but every new topic the film explored made me realize that I had very little grasp on MIT’s place in history and the extent to which it played a role in major historical events. , and every voice I heard reassured me that other students felt as strongly about what we were seeing as I did.

I was shocked to see how much things have changed since then. MIT’s student culture is what made me want to go here, and the community I’ve found has been the most crucial part of my experience. However, the ability of students to self-organize and uphold their traditions has shifted radically in the past few decades. Living groups that championed self expression have since been eradicated, and many students today don’t even know about their existence. an east campus resident in copley square Today, there are groups who continue to maintain their traditions, building massive forts in their courtyard, holding the same decades-old parties, and doing crazy, creative shit that makes campus feel like home. Less of these communities exist, though, and it’s painful to see what campus life used to be like when there was more space to be “weird” in the way MIT students are so often characterized. Times have changed, but student culture is what drew so many people to this school, so it hurts to see how much these ideals have been compromised. Another aspect of student life that’s different now is activism. In the 1960s onward, MIT students went from being apolitical to being intensely engaged, and have since reverted back to their distant stance. I blame this partially on the internet, which both desensitizes us and provides us with a medium for discourse outside of interactions with our peers. There’s also the influence of yuppies and careerism in the 1980s, which brought greater focus to personal material gain and made flooding hallways and streets in protest seem like an aberration. Since then, students have been increasingly conscious about assuming risk, especially when everything is online and future employers are privy to any activity on campus. mit students protesting near the draper instrumentation laboratory, known for its crucial technological role in Apollo 11 and the Vietnam War (Nov. 1969) Although I understand why things have changed, seeing how robust student life at MIT was sparked a visceral frustration about current restrictions imposed on communities. After all, it was only recently that administration started making changes to student life, which made me wonder what it would be like to be an MIT student a decade prior. I bemoaned the loss of counterculture dorms like Bexley Hall, where I felt I could have thrived if it still existed. I was drawn to how free-spirited the residents seemed, how spontaneous and close-knit the community was, and most of all, the extent to which students could engage with their living space. Sadly, this partially stemmed from the dorm’s shitty infrastructure, which is what led to its eventual demolition. At the time of the first viewing, my living group was scattered across campus due to the renovation of our dorm, Burton Conner. Seeing footage of the dorm in previous years was heart-wrenching since I haven’t been able to live with my community for the majority of my time at MIT. The last section of the film made me even more emotional; it depicted students’ reaction to COVID-19 and the pandemonium that ensued on campus shortly after. This hit me hard since I was a freshman during the onset of the pandemic, and the chaos of MIT shutting down was overwhelming and distressing beyond belief. Leaving campus stripped me away from the community I cherished so much, and being a college student during isolation was awful. It was tragic to witness how much student culture mattered to students across history and then think about how forces beyond my control affected my ability to engage with campus. I left 26-100 in tears. Regressions covers a vast range of themes, but the content in the final cut is only a small fraction of the archival footage that exists. While much of MIT’s history is left untouched, the film helps students glean an understanding of what it means to attend this institute, and what it’s meant for students in the past century, who lived in the same dorms and took the same classes as us. We can walk away with more context about the elements of our current experience, why they exist, and what we can do to better them. A few weeks after watching  , I read an article titled “ Stanford’s War on Social Life, 
struggle to find community ⁠ 05 This article paints an overwhelmingly negative picture of social life at Stanford. I have more than a few criticisms of it, namely the lack of acknowledgement of the harm Greek life can cause, and the notion that poor mental health is linked to the suppression of social distinction. Students at prestigious universities undergo tremendous amounts of stress, and finding community can ease the pressure they are subjected to, but cultural specificity can isolate people as much as it can include them. Stanford’s new social order offers a peek into the bureaucrat’s vision for America. It is a world without risk, genuine difference, or the kind of group connection that makes teenage boys want to rent bulldozers and build islands. It is a world largely without unencumbered joy, without the kind of cultural specificity that makes college, or the rest of life, particularly interesting. Strangely enough, although this article was about another school’s experiences, it affected me quite a bit. In the months post- , my resentment about MIT’s waning student culture was fresh, and I was horrified to see how much other schools suppressed their residential life. Student culture both drew me to MIT and has been integral to my experience here; the support structures I have all stem from the community I’ve found, the community characterized vividly by the article. The spontaneity, the “wild unfettered joy,” the desire to interact with the world in the way you want to, the agency to create your own norms and culture…all of these things resonate deeply with me. The article focuses on the loss of Greek life, but through further research, I learned the greater extent of which student culture was stifled. In the name of managing risk, administration suppressed students’ ability to self-organize, pulling resources from anything perceived as a liability. In addition to the sanitization and elimination of living groups, campus traditions were dismantled one by one. Even the archery club was shut down. The new housing system, designed to promote ‘community,’ is more manufactured and artificial than inclusive. It wrested agency from students and isolated those who would have found home within cultural houses or
 
co-ops. ⁠ 06 cooperative houses, student managed residences Since student culture is so important to me, both before and after the release of  , I’ve taken every opportunity to learn how student life at MIT has changed over time. In discussions with alumni, it’s become apparent how
 
different ⁠ 07 Random note: a friend who graduated in 2013 told me that dining used to be a la carte. Fresh sushi was $2 and sandwiches were under $5, so a meal cost only a few bucks. Now, under the mandatory meal plan system, students are allotted a set number of meals, paying up to $3,500 per semester even if they don't use all their meal swipes. To pay at the door, lunch is ~$16 and dinner is ~$19. This is why I've opted to cook for myself throughout my entire time at MIT—I'd rather manage my own groceries and pay $8 for Chipotle if I don't feel like cooking In the past, MIT had a strong relationship with the local community since our facilities were accessible to everyone. Cambridge and Boston locals would host art events in classrooms, attend LSC showings, and participate in Mystery Hunt alongside students. Access to free space bolstered the local art scene and fostered better relationships between students and the greater community. For me, the most hard-hitting example relates to the waning MIT dance scene. I recently heard that dance crews would practice and freestyle in Building 36, which has dozens of massive windows that serve as mirrors once it gets dark. I found this building early into my freshman year and would dance there to take a break from hours of psetting; it swiftly became one of my favorite places on campus. Hearing that much of Boston’s krump, popping, and breakdancing scene has roots in this building is crushing, as I never got the chance to engage with this community. While I don’t know how much the loss of this building impacted the Boston dance scene, I have personally witnessed MIT’s fading relationship with the greater dance community. Due to the pandemic, local studios closed down, so students lost avenues to take classes, learn about different styles of dance, and train alongside locals. Now, the entire culture of MIT dance is different, and in my eyes, much worse. I can only wonder what things would be like if Building 36 was still open and students had exposure to the Boston dance scene. As   makes very clear, MIT has been a major driver of gentrification in Cambridge. While it may be impossible to ameliorate the harm this institution has caused on the local community, opening the doors of campus to outsiders would have a tremendous impact. MIT’s dynamic with Cambridge and Boston isn’t the only thing that’s changed—in the past decade, the range of diversity within residential life has been diminished. It’s painful to hear the experiences of alumni who lived in communities like Senior House and Bexley Hall, which were eradicated. Students in these dorms could access their roof whenever they liked, furnish their rooms with lofts and furniture of their own making, and paint sprawling murals in the hallways on a whim. They also enjoyed less restrictions on social life, so they had more freedom to host events without having to be wary of scrutiny. the 2008 Bexxxley Roxxx Some More concert, which took place in Bexley’s basement (source: the Tech) Kurt Cobain of Nirvana performing at Senior House (April 1990) Senior House Steer Roast Today, Senior House and Bexley no longer exist, and in their wake, there are fewer free-thinking and experimental communities. It makes sense—whenever a group goes down, there are less people to fight for the other ones. As organizations fall away, any remaining exuberance feels like an aberration, an unnatural imposition on the status quo. I’ve heard a lot about the struggles my living group has faced in our 50+ years of existence. We’ve adapted to meet the circumstances, and have retained a lot of qualities that defined the community in the past, but it’s unquestionable that restrictions, particularly those after 2010, have affected our ability to function in the way we want to. The same goes for communities across campus. It’s hard to discern why administration is limiting certain longstanding traditions. For example, mural culture is steadily being restricted; after renovations taking place in the next ~5 years, all dorms will no longer be designated as mural buildings. While students and members of admin have worked together to establish measures of preserving mural making, students can’t paint on walls anymore, nor can they paint on the largest possible removable canvases. In the new Burton Conner, there are guidelines designating the
 
size and location ⁠ 08 according to fire code, canvases can only cover 20% of a wall. wall sizes also vary and are way larger than you think, so we're severely limited I’ve been on Burton Conner’s renovation team for three years, and I still don’t understand why mural culture is being suppressed. I’ve heard various opinions from administration: “ ; “ .” These statements always seemed nonsensical to me, as the murals in Burton Conner are what made it feel like home to so many residents. An empty house is safe. A blank slate is fair. In the name of safety and fairness, Stanford destroyed everything that makes people enjoy college and life. Walking down the halls of Burton Conner and seeing the blank white walls is nauseating. We’ve tried to work around restrictions, making murals out of painter’s tape and adding colored filters to the lights, but some of these measures are taken down and thrown out for violating fire code. I can’t help but miss the way things were in my freshman year. i miss the orange and black walls and tiling & the dingy, lived-in feel of this. there was so much personality that’s now gone taken right after we moved in this year Stanford students live in brand new buildings with white walls. We have a $20 million dollar meditation center that nobody uses. But students didn’t ask for any of that. We just wanted a dirty house with friends. I don’t know why many of the facets of social life that students value are disappearing. I know that administration works within their limits, and we work within ours. Sometimes, restrictions are necessary; other times, they are the result of heavy-handed liability avoidance, and aren’t conducive to cultivating the student life that MIT prides itself for. Stanford has become a case study of how overzealous bureaucrats can crush natural social expression, and how the urge to excise danger can quickly devolve into a campaign to whitewash away anything remotely interesting. In my time here, I’ve been a part of multiple communities where it is accepted and encouraged to interact with your environment, to be comfortable within your living spaces, to exist without shame. I’ve been continually surrounded by individuals who question conventions, refuse to just live within their confines, and seek out norms that provide them with the greatest fulfillment possible. These individuals are some of the funniest, most intellectually curious people I’ve ever met. In all my involvement with student government, I’ve fought to preserve this part of MIT’s personality—the part formed by irreverent, quirky people who don’t give a fuck about what’s normal and what’s not. The people who paint murals and build massive wooden rollercoasters and live carefree. Counterculture—”weird” kids, painted walls, pride flags—is what attracted me to MIT. While you can find students like this at any school, MIT was the only place with a whole dorm of us. I came to MIT because of East Campus: a community where I could explore, create, and feel not just safe, but celebrated. When MIT destroys these dorms, MIT writes me out of its history and its future. Watching Senior Haus, Bexley, Burton-Conner, and soon East Campus get shut down or gentrified beyond recognition makes it hard to imagine students like me coming to MIT in the future, and more subtly, it feels like MIT saying, “We don’t want you here.” – Simon R. ’24 a rollercoaster built by east campus residents in their courtyard I graduate at the end of this year, which means I have a few months left to shape the trajectory of Burton Conner. Before I leave, I want new residents to understand what it entails to be a part of a dorm with rich history and traditions, and what it means in the broader context of MIT student life. That’s why I pushed underclassmen in my living group to attend  the second screening of  Regressions —I wanted them to see footage from communities like Bexley and Senior House  to understand why exactly they should care about preserving student culture.  If they resonate with the values they see and resent the way things are now, I hope they can embrace nonconformity and the freedom of expression in spite of living in a space with so many limitations. a group of students painting murals in the infinite corridor. who knows whether they asked for permission MIT used to be sterile; in the early 1960s, the Infinite Corridor was grey, and counterculture was practically non-existent.  All it took was a few groups of students to breathe life into campus, creating enduring culture and shaping it to be the place that attracted me, my peers, and all those who came before us.  Things It’s easy to mourn how much things have changed, but a lot of what’s happened has been inevitable. The pandemic had a drastic impact on everyone, not just student communities, and we will continue to feel its effects in years to come. On the administrative end, the perceived assault on MIT’s cultural heritage arises from many factors, many of which will never be clear to the student body. What’s evident is that there is a lot of liability associated with allowing students to modify their spaces and have total autonomy over their living groups. Cutting down on residential tradition, limiting self expression, and randomizing housing would solve a lot of problems, although it would be antithetical to MIT’s values. While there are many administrators who support students and defend their right to protect residential culture, a select group—as discussed in  —have consistently tried to diminish and even abolish that things that make MIT the way it is. As much as students can attempt to fight these changes, we all have only four years here. Longevity comes from a transfer of institutional knowledge, and when that’s disrupted, as it was during the pandemic, cultural continuity is even harder. If I had it my way, every student who feels a connection to MIT’s student culture, regardless of what that means to them, would watch  . Even if they’re satisfied with the way things are now, I hope they can see what student culture has provided their peers so they can support them as they navigate changing restrictions. I want future students to understand that, in some ways, the idealized version of MIT they hear about isn’t   how it is these days, although they can change that. Student culture is by no means dead, just adapting to recent changes, and if there’s anything MIT students are good at, it’s finding creative ways to do what they love. The current president, L. Rafael Reif, is stepping down at the end of the year, and there are a handful of people in student life administration who are leaving as well. I can only hope that those who replace them demonstrate respect for their predecessors, appreciate MIT’s traditions, and want to preserve what makes this school so unique. After I graduate, I hope living communities will continue to thrive, and that the administration will bear the responsibility of sustaining a campus where students can find their niches. How this trend of student life continues is up to all of us: will administration let MIT become like other colleges, and will students rise to protect what they love? 80 years. 100,000 alumni. Trillions of dollars. What started as an idea, to better the world through technology, has become the gold standard. Through the tireless work of generations of extremely talented people, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has grown from a patch of dirt into a city on a river. And yet, with all our talent, and all our resources, the pandemic brought this institute to a halt. Already, MIT has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and it is clear that the Institute will survive. But it will not survive unchanged. Living groups and student clubs do not have billion-dollar endowments. Which of them will survive? And if they die, what traditions will we lose? What will take their place? As students return to their labs, what research will we conduct, and who will fund it? As we recover our balance and march on to progress, who is MIT going to be?

This is my favorite poem.  Ladies and Gentlemen in Outer Space By Ron Padget Here is my philosophy: Everything changes (the word “everything” has just changed as the word “change” has: it now means “no change”) so quickly that it literally surpasses my belief, charges right past it like some of the giant ideas in this area. I had no beginning and I shall have no end: the beam of light stretches out before and behind and I cook the vegetables for a few minutes only, the fewer the better. Butter and serve. Here is my philosophy: butter and serve. Most people I’ve shown think this poem is incomprehensible. It honestly  is  incomprehensible. But, perhaps the best reason I can give for my love of  Ladies and Gentlemen in Outer Space  is that, in my mind, this poem is yellow. Warm yellow. It’s the color of an old fluorescent light, like the square of illumination created by a single open window in a darkened apartment complex. The sort of yellow that makes you think of your childhood and white kitchen appliances. This poem is impossible to divorce from its color. I genuinely don’t have the words to explain it, but this poem has such a power to evoke this hyperspecific feeling. Many things are just better expressed in terms of color. Feelings – physical and emotional – and colors are intertwined. I remember high school as a blur of grey; in one word, I would describe it as  controlled .  I spent most of my time alone, studying. Not that I didn’t enjoy it – high school was the place where I a) discovered my love of biology, and b) spent time developing a sense of intellectual vivacity. I figured that I wanted to come out of high school an educated citizen of the world, and I devoured every piece of knowledge I could get my hands on. I  loved  (and love) learning with every fiber of my being. Simultaneously, though, loneliness was a big part of my high school experience. I  had  a friend group, but I look back and realize how colorless life felt back then. I like to think about it in terms of feelings. Not emotions – I’m talking about sensations.
 
Boston is   cold.  ⁠ 01 I'm so astute, it's crazy. Cruelly, brutally cold. Every day last winter, I would leave Next House and gasp. I was delighted every single time. I felt awake, shocked, and a little bit more alive. Cold weather makes you feel human, in some strange way. You’re aware of your every extremity, you can feel the warmth of your own breath, the softness of your sweater. The whole experience is intoxicating. The chill is bright, stabbing into your consciousness, a shard of pastel, luminous blue.  During my freshman fall, I often struggled with a feeling of all-consuming dread. One night, when I was feeling particularly horrible, I went out in the midst of a November thunderstorm. It was raining so hard that it felt as if the ice-cold pellets of water were rocks. I left my jacket unzipped and my hood down. I was chilled to the bone within 30 seconds of walking out the door, but all I could really think about was the searing heat of the tears on my face. You can’t really see your tears in the rain, but you can certainly feel them.
 
After the blossoming grief in my chest had worn off,  ⁠ 02 it’s the orange of a dying ember if you were wondering. Sorrow. Nightfall is a true ultramarine, the color of paint squeezed right out of the tube. I like to sit on the rocks near the Charles, crouch down so I’m almost at water level, and run my hand across the surface of the uneven stones. On a windy day, the river is in constant motion, rippling with the reflected shine of the Boston skyline. There’s a soft coolness that settles on the surface of your skin, just enough to numb the tips of your fingers. Boston is a shower of sparkles that perpetually feels as if it ought to fade into nothing, like fireworks. A sea of blue, scattered with bright, concentrated points of pure white, red, and deep yellow. I’ve had golden afternoons in the summer that make your skin tingle in the suffocating heat. In the summer, it feels as if everything has been covered with a light wash of yellow by noon time. The evening sky is cotton candy pink.  I spend most of my commute to class looking up, absorbed by the scintillating green of leaves in the breeze against the clear, autumnal, blue sky. These were all things I  learned  during  my freshman year of college. I think, in amassing these colors, I was figuring out how to be thoroughly, truly, entirely, achingly alive. As a freshman, I began to see myself as being defined by this extremely vivid experience of life. Having emotions, and leaning into them, became part of my conception of who  was. She was emotional, because to be honest, even though my freshman fall was incredibly, incredibly miserable, it felt real. Real-er than anything else had, ever. I felt like a human. It was honestly hard to resist; In the course of a few months, I experienced the rosiness of infatuation, the ebony black of depression, the
 
strange, constant flickering between elation and desolation that characterized my first relationship, ⁠ 03 it never, really, got a color Sophomore fall is different. I’ve experienced a lot more emotions than I had a year ago. Life is quieter, less chaotic, and less painful. There are fewer emotions to be hard, partly because I have a lot more control now. The river is still where I go when I want to feel things, though. I’ll text my friend Nathan at some ungodly hour of the night, and drag him to the same rock by the Charles every time. I’ll fold my legs, plop down next to him, and just… sort of… sit there. And I’ll experience the range of human emotions. Sometimes I say something, and sometimes I don’t. That’s, I guess, the thing about really, genuinely having feelings; they’re incredibly hard to capture. I think they’re like inherent truths that reverberate in your soul. Indisputable, unchangeable, powerful, on their own. Colors are really the best approximation I have for what’s happening because words aren’t enough. Either way… life certainly isn’t grey anymore.

(taps mic) is this thing working? hello? okay, great. that’s cool. it’s been a while since i wrote a sad post here. well, not sad exactly, but like, a deep post. something that’s a little more reflective and less funny, or witty, or whatever. it’s not like i haven’t been sad. i guess it’s just that i’ve been busy with classes, and my urop, and there’s a lot going on, you know? and also, overall, i’m a lot happier these days than i was before. which is a good thing! i’m writing this directly from my brain, minimal editing, stream of consciousness — just my raw unfiltered thoughts. which may or may not be a good thing. what have i been up to? good question. right now, i’m sitting on my chair in a weird position, typing this out. i just made a bunch of heart-shaped cookies with chris and tiramisu for a hall birthday. it’s the first day of the long weekend. i’ve got lots of fun things planned! like whale watching tomorrow with grace, and apple picking on tuesday organized by dormcon, which sounds really cool. chris and i went strawberry picking over the summer and that was a dream. something about being on a farm just activates my midwestern genes. and it’s really cool to look at a basket of fruit and be like, “yeah! i did that! i picked all of those :)” but it’s all kind of stressful, at the same time. i’m taking 48 units this semester, and when i describe my courseload to people their eyes kind of widen and they’re like, “please love yourself,” and i’m like, “well, i’m in it already and i feel too stubborn to drop anything, so there’s nothing that can be done ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” maybe you can be the judge of that. i’m taking 5.12 (organic chemistry i), which hasn’t been   bad, but we just had our first exam and it was a little rough. i did okay, though. not great, but okay, which i’ll take. i don’t know, i kind of like organic chemistry, and i like the professor. he’s got a very animated way of speaking, and he looks like he could be in a 70s band or something. it’s just that the exams suck. i’m also taking  6.1010 and then there’s my hass, sts.060/21a.303 (anthropology of biology), and even though the prospect of sitting down for a three-hour lecture on wednesdays with back-to-back classes beforehand seemed sort of terrifying, it’s actually been really chill. and my professor gives us breaks, which is good. we watch a lot of…interesting videos in lecture. last class, he showed us a documentary about scientists taking dna samples from indigenous people all over the world, which already raises a lot of red flags, and what made it worse is that they would straight up lie to people about what they were doing — using the pretense of disease testing in order to collect blood. and then it flashed to a shot of lobby 7. the collective reaction: hey, that’s mit! and then: oh no. it’s mit. (synchronized groaning.) because generally when mit shows up in media like this, it’s like……ohhhhhh noooo……..this isn’t a very good sign… it cut to a classroom where some guy was talking to students about informed consent and what i thought was kind of funny was that you could see cups with the
 
toscanini’s ⁠ 01 an ice cream place in central, and pretty famous around campus ……….. and then there’s 6.1220 (formerly 6.046, and everyone still calls it that). it kind of feels like is 046 holding me hostage. i originally wasn’t going to take it until senior year, and then i found out that a bunch of my friends are taking it this semester, and bryson was like, “please take it with us we will carry you it will be fine,” so i was like, “okay,” and added it to my registration. most of the people i know are just trying to pass the class and put it on pnr, since 046 is  notoriously i keep telling myself and other people that i’m just taking it because my friends are, and that i’ll drop it if it gets too hard because i want to prioritize my other classes and my urop and my work as a member of the banana lounge design team, but at the same time i really don’t want to drop it. i feel like i’m in far enough and that i’ve done enough work that dropping it feels like i’ve wasted my time. and i know that sort of thinking is the textbook definition of the sunk cost fallacy, but like, i’ve made it this far! i don’t want to give up now!! but god, it’s so hard!!! so yeah — after the long weekend, i’ve got a 6.009 quiz on wednesday, a 6.046 exam on thursday, a 5.12 pset due on thursday too, and i originally had a 1500-1800 word paper for my hass due on wednesday as well before i emailed the professor a couple weeks in advance to be like, “hey dude, i don’t think i can turn it in on wednesday.” the good thing about hass professors is that they’re pretty generous about extensions, so i’m probably turning it in on saturday or sunday. but those looming responsibilities are still on my mind, preventing me from fully relaxing, which feels like it defeats the purpose of having a long weekend. like, what the heck?? sometimes i question whether i’m able to handle all of this. it’s not just my classes — my urop at the broad institute is also a lot of work, something my mentor made very clear. and being part of the banana lounge is really fun and enjoyable, but it’s also a lot of effort. and let’s not even talk about looking for internships. i don’t feel remotely qualified for most of the positions i’ve applied to, honestly, but i guess i’m still trying. it’s just — god, i feel like i’m doing too much. at the same time, i feel like i’m not doing enough. i think that’s a contradiction  that has followed me What am I doing? It doesn’t feel like I’m doing much at all, but I’m also doing so much at the same time. How is that even possible? And that’s not even considering all of the weird social stuff I’ve been trying to navigate this semester, and also juggling my mental and physical health. because i feel so behind sometimes. 5.12 and 6.009 both seem like sophomore-level classes, with some precocious freshmen in the mix, and it’s not like i’m out of place as a junior, but i think almost all of my friends who have those two classes as major requirements have taken them already. and i wasn’t doing an internship over the summer, and i’ve never had a coding interview before — although i have a couple coding assessments i have to do over the next few weeks, and i’ve never done any of those before, either, and i’m really nervous about them. and no matter how much people try to reassure me that being at mit is already a huge achievement, i feel like… …well, i kind of feel like i peaked in high school. it’s not a great feeling, and maybe it’s also not true — i’m definitely more confident and capable than i was in high school, but being surrounded by people who are doing really cool things and have had really cool internships and also probably have really good jobs lined up after graduation, i just feel like i’m not enough! but i’m doing so much!!! but it doesn’t feel like it’s enough!! what   enough? does anyone here ever feel like they’re enough? does anyone in general ever feel like they’re enough? god, it’s just like the fig tree from plath’s  the bell jar I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. i think that maybe in the next few months i will have to make some difficult decisions. best case scenario: i’m able to handle everything and anything life throws at me. woohoo! 
worst case ⁠ 02 i can't see the words 'worst case' without thinking of complexity analysis in 6.046 honestly …and then life will go on. it’s not the end of the world if i can’t keep up with certain things, or if i didn’t take a few classes as a sophomore. i have people who love me and want to support me and it’s okay to take things at my own pace. and it’ll be okay. probably. hopefully. maybe. i guess i have to just keep chugging along.

Have you ever wanted to be a performer but can’t sing or dance? Why not put on a show from the comfort of the Lecture Series Committee projection booth? With training from our highly qualified projectionists, you’ll be running the show on your own in no time. Just follow the link on the screen or talk to one of our personnel after the show. LSC – it doesn’t suck! I’d never been a big fan of film back in high school, but watching the LSC intro before  Jojo Rabbit  gave me the urge to become a projectionist for the club. After all, I reasoned, college is a time to try out new things. I signed up for a training slot, and before I knew it, I was projecting  Knives Out  on my own just a few weeks later! However, I soon realized that the intro, which included clips of people working with 35 mm film, was a bit outdated. These days, movies are primarily projected digitally, with computers automating almost every step. When I joined, LSC hadn’t used physical film since 2015. That would all change in the following semester, thanks to the brilliant LSC chair at the time, who resolved to do at least one film screening before graduation. I was lucky enough to help with that first 35 mm film screening of  Howl’s Moving Castle ; it was a bit traumatizing and I forgot to document the process, but it still was an incredible experience. About two weeks ago, I got a refresher on 35 mm projection for the  Spirited Away  screening that weekend and remembered to take some pictures this time. Without further ado, here’s a brief guide to 35 mm film projection for LSC! What is 35 mm film? Two thousand feet of colour film stock, 35 mm wide, and pulled through a projector at a constant 24 frames per second. That gives you one reel of film – multiply that by 8, and you’ve got all 125 minutes of  Spirited Away . 35 mm film. By Runner1616 – film izle, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19318310 To project all these reels with no noticeable breaks in-between, we alternate between two separate projectors pointed at the same screen. We use pairs of cue dots to coordinate them synchronously; the first dot tells us to start the motor, and the second dot tells us to switch projectors: A cue dot on a movie frame. By Rotareneg – en:Image:35mm_film_audio_macro.jpg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1210853 For some reason, time is represented in two different ways in the film industry. There are real seconds, and then there are “academy seconds”. One academy second corresponds to one foot of film, which is 16 frames or ⅔ seconds. Pretty confusing, but you’ll get used to it relatively quickly. The film also contains audio data in the space not taken up by pictures. There are generally
 
four audio encodings present ⁠ 01 https://xkcd.com/927/ The four audio encodings on 35 mm film. By Rotareneg – en:Image:35mm_film_audio_macro.jpg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1210853 Fun fact: Dolby Digital’s encoding algorithm is so good that they can afford to print their logo in the middle of each square between sprocket holes. What a way to flex your technology! Some people prefer film over digital because of nostalgia, while others enjoy that someone in the projection booth is physically responsible for their moviegoing experience. But whatever the reason, everyone agrees it’s a nice change from the digital projection that dominates theatres these days. Pre-screening First things first, we need to inspect the film. Our goals here are twofold – to check the positions of cue dots and to find (and fix) bad splices. We check for cue dots in advance to know how to position the starting frame when we’re threading the film through the projector: An example of a cue sheet for   last semester Cue dots are easy to find because they’re at the end of the film reel, usually at 0.75 and 8 seconds (18 and 192 frames) before the final frame. We also have a frame counter device to make this even easier: LSC’s frame counter device Fun fact: our copy of  Spirited Away ’s 5th reel had a dot near the middle for some reason. Luckily(?), I was distracted at that point of the screening and missed the erroneous cue. Splices are parts of the film that have been cut and joined together manually. These splices are sometimes floppy or unstable, which could lead to the film getting jammed during projection. This would break our projectors and destroy the film through overexposure – not the sort of BOGO deal you’d want to get. Splices exist for a variety of reasons, but one of the main reasons is “plattering” – when a cinema splices all the reels together into one giant reel: The size of an IMAX film platter; IMAX is 70 mm film. By Philip Jaeger, https://evergreenmuseum.wordpress.com/tag/imax/ They do this so that they don’t need projectionists to handle changeovers. Plattering sounds good in theory, but they have to cut and splice the film into separate smaller reels before returning it to the distributor. This is where the errors creep in. You can physically feel splices when running the film through your fingers because they’re joined with scotch tape; likewise, we use scotch tape to repair them. Not the most high-tech solution, but it works for our purposes. Now that you know all about inspecting film, let’s get to it! “Am I doing it right?” Woah, slow down there, bucko! Remember to wear cotton gloves to avoid scratching and gunking up the film. Inspecting film Much better! These gloves are conductive, so you can still use your phone while wearing them. And finally, we rewind the film (with the rewinder machine) after finishing: It’s rewind time! Great – now we’re ready to do a test screening to ensure there are no egregious errors and then show the movie to an audience! Showtime! There are two main things that projectionists do during a screening – threading the film through the projector and watching for cue dots to handle changeovers. We usually thread the first two reels of the film before the movie starts, but each subsequent one has to be handled within 20 minutes of its start. With practice, this process is pretty fast and streamlined, but it’s intense for a first-time projectionist. (I was originally planning to have an interactive applet to demonstrate threading, but WordPress doesn’t like me, so here’s a static image instead:) How to thread the projector Pretty complicated, right? Fortunately for us projectionists, there’s a handy chart taped to the side of each projector that shows the threading diagram: Thanks, past projectionists, for figuring this out This chart and little numbers/diamonds on the film also tell us which frame should be aligned before we start the motor: Very convenient Watching for cue dots is a lot more straightforward. We just have to stare at the top right corner until we see them flash. The catch is that each dot flashes for only 4 frames (0.17 seconds); blink and you’ll miss it. Test your reaction time with the applet below! N/A N/A Keeping our eyes fixed on the top of the frame without blinking isn’t the most fun way to watch a movie, so we don’t do that. Instead, the projectors have
 
mechanisms ⁠ 02 The mechanism takes advantage of the fact that the angular speed of the reel increases as it gets played. Pretty neat 8.01 moment  Missing a changeover isn’t the end of the world, but it’s tradition for the audience to yell “LSC sucks!” in the rare event that it does happen (speaking from experience 🥲). Congratulations – you now (vaguely) know how to put on a show in the comfort of the LSC projection booth! Remember, LSC – it doesn’t suck! #Film #LSC

For the last several years, I’ve been getting canker sores around the inside of my bottom lip. If you’ve been lucky enough to never experience them, canker sores are circular ulcers that appear on the soft tissue of your mouth. From what I’ve gathered online, what happens is that the top layer of skin dissolves, exposing the nerve endings, so whenever the sore is touched (which happens often, since it’s in your mouth), it hurts. They last about a week, and can make it painful to eat or speak. Their cause is unknown.  image i found online I don’t remember when I started getting these. It was definitely when I was a teenager, but I’m not sure if it was in high school or college. I get them several times a year. Over the years, I’ve tried a lot of remedies to ease the pain. Here is how they’ve worked for me:  I figured I could use ice to numb the pain. This did not work that well, because the sore is on the inside of my mouth, not the outside, so I couldn’t really hold a bags of frozen peas to my lips and ice easily melts inside my mouth.  1/10 I saw on Reddit that putting a lot of salt on a canker sore would kill the bacteria and promote healing. All this did was sting quite a bit, and did nothing to make my sore heal faster. 0/10 Also a Reddit suggestion. This didn’t sting, but it still did nothing to make my sore heal faster. Honey was more fun to eat, though. 2/10 Several brands, such as Orajel, sell anesthetics that contain 20% benzocaine. I squirt a little gel onto the sore and while it stings initially, eventually the inhibiting mechanism of benzocaine eases the pain. The gel is mint-flavored but it tastes a little gross, and if you’re not careful while applying it, it can numb your tongue too. Also, the numbness only lasts about 20 minutes for me. Still, it’s very useful for eating, so I often use this before meals when I have a canker sore. 7/10 This is a topical medication that isn’t available in the United States and is unfortunately quite expensive to purchase online ($25 for two swabs). Also, it is very very painful for about five seconds. From my understanding, it basically cauterizes the sore and creates a seal, so nerve endings cannot be stimulated anymore. Afterwards, my canker sore didn’t hurt anymore and I could move on with my life. If you’re going to use this, I recommend having somebody else apply the swab. 9/10 Of course, prevention is the best remedy. Googling canker sore causes didn’t give me anything definitive; I had noticed that canker sores always crop up if my mouth is injured, but sometimes, they would occur even without an injury. I decided to try a different toothpaste, and the Internet recommended Tom’s of Maine, which is SLS-free, meaning it lacks sodium lauryl sulfate. Since I’ve started using it, I haven’t gotten a single canker sore, except for one week where I was traveling and using a different toothpaste instead. Maybe that was just a coincidence . . . but I’m going to play it safe and keep using Tom’s. 10/10

The way we interact in our three-dimensional world is frankly kind of confusing, especially considering how many different visualizations there are  
possible. ⁠ 01 It's important to note how I am defining dimension here. By dimension, I refer to the number of independent directions on your space. The most clear understanding of this may be through the directions on Earth: up/down, left/right, and forwards/back. The number of these directions is (vaguely) the dimension of what you're considering. On the one hand, we can understand our three-dimensions through lower dimensions. For instance, the Earth is locally homeomorphic to R^2, by which I mean, it looks like a plane at a given location (if you suppose that you can only see a short distance away). This isn’t to say that flat-earthers are by any means correct, but I think the misconception’s origins do, to some extent, make sense. A perhaps less controversial way to understand this can be seen through the use of cameras; taking a photo of our three-dimensional world results in a two-dimensional image of what can be seen from where you point the camera. But I digress. These examples motivate numerous areas of study in math, in particular single-variable and multivariable calculus. But there are similarly interesting ways to understand our world through higher dimensions, however weird that may seem. The most common example of this is found in physics, in which we consider the fourth dimension of time. Some might disagree with this notion, given that time is independent of our  
“space”, ⁠ 02 i.e. the notion of time <strong>and</strong> space When I was at my most existential, I used to worry that humans were pieces of four-dimensional beings. When I brought this up with my friend, he said (understandably) “what the heckers?”– but hold on, I will explain what I mean. Consider cutting an apple into thinner and thinner slices. The more thin you make these slices, the more 2-dimensional it becomes. Of course, in our real world we could never actually   to something 2-dimensional, given that the slices of apple will always have   non-infinitesimal thickness, but in math this notion works out quite nicely. In math, a “slice” of a three-dimensional object is two-dimensional. And in fact the higher up in dimensions we go, the more this is true. A slice of a four-dimensional object, is three dimensional. So when I was at my most existential, I worried that there might be some higher-dimensional-being that I’m merely a   of. A fragment of. An infinitesimal part of. As it turns out, for some reason, this is a concept that also comes up in  
philosophy. ⁠ 03 I'd like to thank Ana Sanchez '22 for telling me about this somewhat cursed but also beautiful concept Picture yourself as a worm  
(a four-dimensional one at that). ⁠ 04 don't you love it when the title of a piece is in the text? I love when that happens. . You may wonder what the point of this is– what the concept of a four-dimensional worm actually gives you in a philosophical sense. And while there are many possible take-aways from this concept in the Philosophy of Time and numerous other areas of study, I’m interested in the worm’s relationship with identity. Identity changes and shifts over time, but identity in the   is an integral part of who you currently  . As someone who’s trans, I think about this quite a lot (though I’m certain you can find a part of your identity that is similar). I am a woman– that is my identity, right here, right now. But the fact that I grew up understanding my identity to be a masculine one   plays a role in who I am today. It plays a role physically, for instance how I’m   
6’1″~. ⁠ 05 I am now the tallest blogger take that @ Alan This visualization of the human experience is a bit obscure, but I find it comforting. Something along the lines of “I stand on the shoulders of the giants I once was” or another. It makes me feel like I’m not stagnant– I’m growing   my worm over time, though at any point of the worm the world is (locally) three-dimensional (i.e.   to R^3, vocab word of the day). Now for the part of the blog in which I get more into why the hell I’m  
writing about this. ⁠ 06 alas it isn't just to cause an existential crisis with your morning dose of college applications Picture yourself as  
numerous four-dimensional worms, ⁠ 07 one simply wasn't enough for this blog post parts of my identity This summer I wrote that I wanted to spend this summer focusing on being an academic. Focusing purely on my math, and math research, and whatever the hell it means to “be a mathematician”. I felt like this would be the only   way to know if I would like being a graduate student. Because as a graduate student, it may be hard to find the time to work on hobbies/side interests you find interesting. I recognized that this is the case, and wanted to see if I would like who I become if I stop putting in the effort to satiate the various other parts of my identity (the other worms, if you will). I planned to essentially starve out the worms that like writing and teaching so that the academic one could thrive (now I’m picturing a worm doing research, a funny thought). Then, I got into the semester, and you know what happened? I found myself still making time for these interests of mine. I kept hopping on calls with OCW, I became a blogger, I started being the  
UA ⁠ 08 undergraduate assistant 
18.101, ⁠ 09 Analysis and Manifolds . I’m certain in the process some parts of my identity have died down a little. I no longer do puzzles quite like I used to, and I haven’t been working as closely with  as I did last year. These parts dying down for a little bit don’t mean they are gone forever. The slices of the worms in the past still exist, and who knows, after college I might be able to bring them back to life. And these parts of my identity dying down   doesn’t mean they aren’t a part of me. They are a part of my past self, and they may be a part of my future self. Right now, I’m just a four-dimensional worm; growing, evolving, and changing with time. Who I was in the past is a part of who I am now, and who I am now will be a part of who I am in the future. I find that quite exciting. For now, I will save the existential crisis on “If my four-dimensional worms are slices of five-dimensional beings” for another day. P.S. If you want to learn more about understanding four-dimensions through the use of three-dimensions, or three through two, etc., I highly consider the book   by Matt Parker, as well as this  maths-comedy special -dimensions and projection theory. More on that research at another time. #multidimensional #paige being existential #worm

at the ripe age of twenty-one i am beginning to feel my body weaken and crumble in ways that were not previously noticeable. for instance: i notice myself feeling cold much more easily now. as a kid and teenager i could walk in shorts in 40 degree (fahrenheit) weather without any issue, whereas currently the weather in boston is around 50 degrees and i am already feeling the need to wear a jacket my right eyelid has begun twitching when i don’t get enough sleep. this definitely wasn’t the case earlier – my sleep schedule is actually better than it was in years past, but the twitching only started this year this summer, during periods of high anxiety, i could feel my heart occasionally flutter, creating an irregularity in my heartbeat. this was pretty scary at first, so i spent a while researching symptoms and trying to understand what was going on, but it turns out this is actually a normal response to stress that i simply hadn’t felt until june. (i hope i’m not worrying anyone who’s reading this post; this was a very minor symptom that i only felt once every week or so back when it was happening) i’m also noticing how, when i use the wrong form to complete a physical task, the consequences can be more severe than they used to be. for instance, as a result of running improperly and not channeling ground collision forces through the correct part of my feet, i had several minor foot injuries during the past year. each one only lasted around a week, but foot injuries are particularly annoying because they are easily felt i learned the hard way that, when you have a minor foot injury, the correct response is to pretend that nothing happened and to walk exactly the way you’re used to, even if doing so makes every step painful. because if you change the way you walk to reduce the pain that occurs when your foot comes in contact with the ground, you redirect large amounts of weight to parts of the foot which aren’t used to receiving weight, increasing risk of injury to those areas. the other problem with changing how you walk in response to an injury is that you can forget how to walk – the first time i injured my right foot, i took footsteps in a way that minimized pressure on my right foot, and after doing this for a few days i realized i didn’t really remember how to take regular right footsteps anymore. luckily my left foot was mostly unaffected, so i was able to relearn walking by paying careful attention to how my left foot moved and then training my right foot to move in the mirror image of my left foot this anecdote isn’t just me being pedantic, by the way. it’s reasonably common for people to permanently change how they walk or run in response to injury, and the outcomes are often not good. eg. there are many stories of basketball players injuring themselves in one leg, subconsciously shifting more weight to the other leg, and then injuring the other leg as a result. the instinct of redistributing weight to reduce pain is extremely natural, and it takes conscious effort to oppose anyway, in response to all this i am doing a few things differently to take better care of my body: the first is drinking water more regularly. pretty self-explanatory i am also doing more balanced workouts now. i pay more attention to leg strength, which i had been neglecting until recently because i thought running provided sufficient leg exercise (spoiler: it doesn’t). i also noticed my flexibility has decreased significantly in the past few years, so now i try to stretch more as well speaking of workouts, i’ve begun a habit of working out at 2am on friday nights / saturday mornings. i don’t really have a great reason for doing this other than that i felt inspired by  jimmy butler’s 3:30am workouts  (my times for other days of the week are more reasonable). on the bright side, there are barely any people in the gym at that time, and doing this ensures a productive start to the weekend one habit i’ve been trying to get into but have been inconsistent about so far is wearing sunscreen. it’s probably worthwhile to delay skin damage and eventual skin cancer, but i have an aversion to putting sunscreen on every day because it just feels very unpleasant in my opinion. this might be a sign that i should try different sunscreen options this summer my phone broke down and became largely unusable, so i went to the t-mobile store to get a new phone (shoutout to jason and cj, who went with me). my old phone was a samsung phone, so i decided to buy a new samsung phone, and there was a convenient feature to transfer all your settings, apps, and data between samsung phones. i waited a few minutes for the transfer to complete, and then suddenly my new phone looked exactly like my old one – the same apps in the same locations, the same black background, the same camera roll (and i mean local camera roll, not the cloud-backed one) the experience felt very bizarre at the time, but i couldn’t immediately verbalize what i found strange about it. it was only much later that i realized what i had witnessed – this wasn’t just a data transfer; it was  immortality , specifically immortality via reincarnation. when a species has the ability to escape wear and tear by efficiently transferring knowledge from old bodies to new ones, that species has effectively attained immortality, and samsung phones have figured it out. i hope that one day humans will also be able to master this process, but until then i need to be taking much better care of my physical body than i have been so far

when people tell me that math is important in learning computer science (drawing by k.c. green) I don’t hate math, but I’ve never particularly loved it either. Math always felt more like a necessity than something I could ever establish an interest in. The weird thing is that I really like topics that are based in math, or at least involve a good amount of logic and reasoning. It’s satisfying to see things line up with a clear line of logic, y’know? But on the other hand, my feelings towards math itself is a lot rockier, swinging between begrudging acceptance and helpless despair until it averages out into a feeling of “meh.” Despite this, I’ve decided to dedicate my undergraduate studies towards artificial intelligence, which means that I’m signing myself up for a ton of math. It’s understandable, since math is what you need to understand old systems and build new ones. If you think about it, math is how you get your WALL-E’s, your HAL-9000’s, and your Terminators. I decided to knock out all three 6-4 math requirements this semester, breaking the record for the most number of math classes I’ve ever taken at once. Elementary discrete mathematics for science and engineering, with a focus on mathematical tools and proof techniques useful in computer science. (Fall 2022 Course Catalog) Formerly called  
6.042, ⁠ 01 Course 6 (EECS Department) got reworked in the past months, changing the numbers that Course 6 classes go by. 042’s been the hardest class I’m taking so far. I’ve never done proofs before, so even if I understand what a certain proof technique is and how it works, I’ve found it difficult to figure out how to use that technique to get to an answer. It’s been pretty stressful, not gonna lie. Yet, I really like what I’m learning! I’m not great at it, but it’s interesting! The process of getting to an answer is grueling, but figuring out how to get to it is really satisfying. Additionally, I like the two professors teaching this term, so I’ve been making an effort to pay attention enough in lecture so I have a question to ask them after class. I’m griping less about this class than I normally would is because I consistently meet up with my former roomie Nora, so psetting for this class doubles as a kind-of social activity   significantly less painful than psetting by myself, which was the mistake I consistently made last year. I’m also making an effort to camp out in office hours more. I’m 500% more productive in OHs for some reason. Basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing topics useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, singular value decomposition, and positive definite matrices. (Fall 2022 Course Catalog) I don’t have a lot of feelings about this class, except that the professor brings his dog sometimes and she’s really cute. This is my first time learning linear algebra so the psets take a while for me to plow through because I have to get used to the sheer amount of matrices. I do like seeing how the funny little matrices change, like I’m some sort of matrix wizard. Like 042, I feel like I would have a much harder time in this class if I didn’t pset with Nora and Stephen, a fellow 6-4 major I’ve met this year. An introduction to probability theory, the modeling and analysis of probabilistic systems, and elements of statistical inference. Formerly called 6.041, which I call it by instead of 6.3700. Back in elementary school, probability was always that one leftover subject crammed into the back of the math textbook that the teacher would have to rush through because they spent most of the year going over the arithmetic stuff. I didn’t really come in with the expectation to like 041. The content’s really hard for me, but I’ve gained some appreciation towards probability that I wouldn’t have gained without taking the class. At the core of probability is uncertainty, and the field of probability came out of people finding ways to navigate uncertainty and making sense of it. There’s something beautiful about that, and it keeps me motivated to not give up on the assignments no matter how difficult they can be. I share 041 with Stephen, so psetting for that class is   much better than doing it alone. I know I said almost the same thing three times, but psetting with friends I work well with has single-handedly saved my butt so many times in the past month. I don’t know how to end this post, so I’ll leave three takeaways:

In my sophomore fall, I wrote  the art of trying new things This is my
 
CMS ⁠ 01 Comparative Media Studies 
HASS ⁠ 02 Humanities, arts, and social sciences This class is honestly the one I’m least excited about because I really, really hate debating. I think it’s stressful and nervewracking. I signed up for four debate topics this semester as we are required to. My topics are: Research is really fun, though, and I really like deep diving into topics. I just think the actual act of debating is tiring, but luckily I really like Ed and he’s been my professor before for  CMS.621 Fans and Fan Culture I’ve already blogged about my first assignment for this class:  Atomic Friends, a 3 paged comic script The class also has us read a variety of different comic books to help us understand the different styles, with regards to both art and writing, out there. I personally have not read many comics in my life aside from webcomics ( Heartstopper Lore Olympus Check, Please! I really enjoy this class and it’s really making my brain work so hard. Every week, we workshop people’s comic book scripts — aka we go around and talk about what it did well and what it could have done better. I am always amazed at Marjorie’s criticisms because they’re so well-founded and insightful. Often times, she’ll suggest changes to the script such as how she would rework panels either by condensing them, or adding insert panels. Other times, she’ll give dialog or SFX suggestions or things to add artistically to help drive narrative. It’s really incredible hearing these critiques from someone with so much experience and her expertise really is demonstrated through her constructive criticism. I feel like I can learn a lot from her. I’ve been waiting to take this class since I was a freshman and it was only offered this semester. It’s a video-making class!!! It has been incredible sitting in lecture and listening to the professor’s insights because, just like Marjorie Liu, he has so much videomaking and editing experience that every piece of critique he has is chock-full of wisdom and insight. Our first project is a 90-120 second video on someone or some place we find interesting. I decided to do it on my friend who is really, really good at Minesweeper. The recurring theme of all my classes seems to be  , and CMS.335 is no exception. I find that after just these first few weeks of class, I’ve already changed the way I think about videomaking. I find that I put a lot more effort into setting up the shot — lighting, consistency, stability. I also find this reflected in my editing style, too. This class has also been interesting because I’m one of the few people in the class who is very, very comfortable in Adobe Premiere Pro. I have a lot of leftover experience in the software from  my irksome YouTube days What I have in Premiere experience, I lack in artistic direction. There are so many people in my class (shouting out specifically Kidist!!) who I just believe are incredible visionaries. They come up with cool concepts for shots and simply execute on it and I really want to push my limits and try to come up with more interesting, creative content. My first real Harvard class!….that I dropped this week. Dropping this class absolutely broke my heart. I cried over it, which is embarrassing, yes, but hopefully is a testament to how much I did not want to fucking drop this class. In the five weeks I was in this class, I think I learned the most I’ve ever learned in my entire academic career. I read a lot on the theory and basis of sociology — Marx, Durkheim, and Weber — and read a lot about race, gender, sexuality, and class. This class made me feel so excited to go to lecture everyday, but it also filled me with a deep, deep regret of how I’ve spent my college career. There’s a part of me that wishes I had forgone the computer science aspect of my degree altogether and dedicated myself to sociology, media studies, and anthropology entirely. But that’s for another blog. I had to drop this class because this semester I opted to take a fall internship, and that internship will require 20 hours of my week. 20 hrs/wk + 4 classes is very hard, so I felt as though dropping to three was enough and this class unfortunately does not contribute anything to my degree, so it was the first on the chopping block. I loved commuting to Harvard every Tuesday and Thursday and I will really, really miss this class deeply. God, this fucking sucks to even write out. I might just cry all over again. I’m in the Sailing PE class making my way toward  my pirate certificate Every week, I’ve been meeting at the MIT Sailing Pavilion for 90 minutes to ride in  a Tech Dinghy It’s been really fun and I’m so proud of myself for attempting to overcome my fear of dirty bodies of water and boats. In the class, we are paired into groups of two and take turns steering the boat (being the skipper) and releasing and tightening the sail (being the crew). The tightness of the sail determines how fast you go (ie how much you let the wind determine your speed) and the steering. well that’s obvious I guess, it points you where to go. Note that you can in fact capsize in these boats! And that fucking terrifies me! Not cause I can’t swim, I actually was on the swim team for a good chunk of my life. I am simply afraid of how dirty the water is. I learned how to spin things! Ish!  MIT Spinning Arts I’m not the best blogger to talk about these things since I’ve only been once, and we have far more experienced bloggers in this space, but I just thought it was neat. Though I was already in LSC last semester, I’ve decided to be a lot more active. LSC is basically a movie theatre group on campus where we project movies for the MIT community and beyond! I’m so excited because this semester we’re showing Pulp Fiction, Pride and Prejudice, and (potentially) Akira which is super cool cause I want to watch/have watched and enjoyed some of these movies. LSC was also the group that allowed me to watch  Everything, Everywhere, All at Once early and did an exclusive Q&A with the directors. I’ve found that I’m a lot…nicer? This semester. That seems silly to say but I feel as though I’ve always been someone with a relatively short fuse. I’m unsure what to attribute the sudden kindness, too. Maybe getting the shit kicked out of me this summer made me realize that I don’t want to be known as the mean person at work or school. Maybe switching from estrogen-based birth control to progesterone-based birth control is doing wonders for my mood. No clue. But all I know is that I think I feel a lot less…angry than I have been. I think I spent a lot of my teenage years just being angry at everything and everyone. Now I feel as though I’ve mellowed out. Is this what comes with being a jaded senior?

This blog is about my hometown, which I filmed a little bit of last time I went home. Put the quality on 1080 and see the color green unlike you have before. A week ago, I made a separate Instagram account to serve two dozen followers split evenly between my childhood companions and my closest friends at MIT. The account is themed around the proteins in gluten, which make me  irreparably and violently ill upon ingestion I understand the irony of that statement, since I am paid to share my life with thousands of people on a highly visible platform, but I think blogging is different. I am of the opinion that there should be a latency between what we think and what we share online, which eliminates a prolific use of Twitter but does not eliminate planned, long-form posts that require a significant amount of forethought and editing. At least that’s what I tell myself. Some bloggers are more comfortable writing frequent, shorter blogs that are relatively unprocessed. I would be doing readers a disservice to lie and say that was me. In real life, I am an opinionated, fast-talking, hand-waving person, but I am also extremely reserved. Sometimes, when the bloggers meet, I’ll find myself talking about something that is just slightly more vulnerable than usual, and everyone picks up on it, because a breach in my reservedness is a rare and mythical thing. Most of the time I’ll notice and change the subject. I should also say that I don’t believe I am a complex or mysterious person. I also rarely feel misunderstood. It is a weird combination of personality traits.  Anyways, I started the account because I’ve gotten into the habit of obsessively handwriting my thoughts at the end of each day. It’s gotten to the point where I walk across the river multiple times a month with the singular intention to go to Muji and get a fresh notebook just so I can fill it with more writing. Then, I go home, sit at my desk, and handwrite four to six pages. Every. Night. It’s gotten to the point where I believe I am developing tendonitis in my right hand.  Sometimes, I don’t even write in English. If I have a lot to get down and little time to do it, I’ll write one long acronym, with every letter representing a word. In even more dire situations, I’ll write one long continuous scribble as I imagine that I am writing full sentences. If I really need to think about it, I’ll write in Spanish, carefully revising every sentence so that I can communicate it in whatever intermediate grasp of the language I have.  I don’t think this is an unhealthy habit, but I do think it is a compulsion, which I am uneasy about. So, a week ago, I wrote a note on the front cover of my current notebook telling me to give my hand a rest. As a response, I created an Instagram account and started posting massive photo decks of my life. I should mention I also compulsively take photos. Then, I say whatever I want in the caption, which only gives me a couple hundred words, and I turn my phone off. Then I go to sleep. It makes me feel better.  It isn’t all sad things, because the large majority of my thoughts are not sad. I post funny pictures of me and my friends over the last year, and photos of me when I was fourteen and stylistically challenged, and screenshots of all of my internship rejection emails. I talk about how much I love my friends, or how much I’m enjoying my classes. But sometimes, if I think very hard, I’ll write a long and melancholy caption about something I’m struggling with. Some people don’t like that, and they unfollow me. Reasonable. Some people reach out to me and tell me they relate, and we have a nice conversation. Lovely.  The second reason I made the account is because I’ve been missing high school an inordinate amount lately. I come from a very small town, where the people I graduated high school alongside are the people I entered Kindergarten with. There isn’t a lot to do in a small town, so friends usually have conversations in empty parking lots and basements, swapping stories and plans. Because of this, there is an unbreakable bond between Southerners, especially between those of the same age. Generally, after high school graduation, people go into the workforce or stay local for college. There are some socioeconomic factors to this, but I’ve come to realize that Southerners stick together if at all possible. If you decide to uproot and find yourself making small talk over tapas at a table facing the ocean, know that you’ll never be able to look into the eyes of the person across from you and understand quite like you did back home.  Of course, I was the one to uproot. I broke up with my girlfriend, who loved me more than I ever deserved, and told my friends, who stuck by me for fifteen years, goodbye. Then, I got on a plane and came to Boston, a city that at the time I couldn’t point out on a map.  I am so guilty for leaving everyone behind.  When I came to MIT, I quickly met lots of people. Bright, clean, brilliant. Funny. Not in the way that Southerners are funny, but in a way that is less intense and more mechanical and hilarious all the same. I also met extremely wealthy people, who permeate all corners of MIT. Bay Area. Private school. Dad’s credit card. What do you mean you didn’t do competitive math or chess or dance? What do you mean you’ve never seen a house this big? What do you mean you never learned this? What do you mean you’re waiting for your refund to hit?  What do you mean you don’t have anyone from home with you?   It’s not their fault. These are highly intelligent, hard working people, and as much as I despise saying it, I attend the same school, and I am a highly intelligent, hard working person. It’s just hard to not feel disadvantaged when you’re surrounded by people that know what is around the corner miles before they get to it. I have to catch up to the corner and take a good look around before I understand.  All this to say, I met friends I love, even if I don’t believe the large majority of them will ever understand. I made it through the year, and I went back to the South for the summer. And I realized something uncomfortable.  I really miss high school.  I mourn for it. I miss doing manual labor at overtime pay every week. I miss driving home after work, late at night with my windows down, because the roads are so silent and the air is so clean. I miss looking for dogs from missing posters and catching frogs. I miss the farmland. I miss the people who raised me, who loved and supported me and told me that if I wanted to get out, I could. But they would miss me if I did. But they knew it was what I needed.  I miss the precariousness of Tennessee. I miss experiencing the fulcrum that balances stillness and chaos and violence and love, all things one could experience together in a single day. I miss the tornados and taking shelter in my neighbor’s basement. I miss waking up and hearing that  half of Nashville was destroyed an entire block was blown up I miss all the ways Southerners acknowledge each other’s existence in small ways, jumping cars and sharing harvest and watching the neighbor’s kid.  I miss all of these things. I always describe the transition between Tennessee and Boston as a jump cut, because I cannot fathom how the two places can coexist on the same timeline. Every time I board a plane, I can’t imagine myself stepping out of the same plane and into Boston, but I always do.  Deep down, I love Boston too. I like the trains, and I like how walking is the default form of transportation. I like the weather, even when it is cold, so long as it isn’t extraordinarily windy. I like the river, especially in the early fall, when the water is still and the sky is impossibly blue. I like the exotic dogs in Back Bay, and most of the time I like their equally eccentric owners too. But I wonder, even as I swiftly navigate train stations and walk through gaps of traffic, if people recognize that I am not Boston and that there is something unclean and unkept inside me.  One night last year, I went to see a concert in Fenway with some friends. We stood in line for hours next to a sixteen year old who was born and raised in Boston. He realized we went to MIT and asked where we were from. When I told him I was from Tennessee, he said he couldn’t have guessed it.  What a weird thing, to be so terrified of being outed as a Southerner in a place like Boston and a sixteen year old boy tells you that you act like you’re from California.  That night, I wrote pages about how I wish I could uproot MIT, put it on a plane, and take it to Tennessee. I’d put it right on a farm surrounded by cows, just like my high school. I’d let it steep in write-in elections and blue collar jobs and rainwater, and my friends from home would come to classes, and I wouldn’t feel so damn guilty about leaving everyone behind.  But I know I can’t do that, just like I know I’ll never let my hand fully heal.

(fun challenge: drink water every time you read the word Missouri.) At CPW this April, every time I met someone new, I had to be prepared to answer and ask the same set of questions:  what’s your name? where are you from? what are you thinking of majoring in?  It got to the point where I almost took a sharpie, wrote the responses on my flashy CPW nametag —  Teresa, Missouri, uhhhh I applied as an
 
art major but I’ll probably double major ⁠ 01 at least now I've learned to say “I'm thinking 4B and 15-1” so I kind of sound like I know what I'm doing — and preemptively held it up to anyone I hadn’t met before.  When I returned to campus on August 23rd, the cycle of introducing myself and forgetting names I’d just learned a few seconds ago and recognizing people I follow on Instagram only for them to have no idea who I was began anew. The first few weeks were an emotionally exhausting whirlwind, but a pleasant one.  Regardless, the question “where are you from?” is interesting to me — when someone asks me that now, my first response is to say Missouri with a somewhat sheepish expression.
 02 or that one time I said Burton Conner on accident because my brain was lagging a little bit. For whatever reason, the inquiry of which high school one goes to is quintessentially St. Louisan. I never realize how strange this phenomenon is because it’s just oddly important to us. Each school or district comes with its own set of generalizations which, while certainly not always accurate, I refuse to actually name for fear of starting a flame war in my email inbox. For the average St. Louis resident, the presumptions associated with each school cover things like socioeconomic class, athletic ability, likelihood of academic success, or whatever else. I feel like there’s a similar kind of microjudgement that passes when I say which state I’m from. You hear your fair share of “Bay Area”’s,
 
but very rarely will you hear “Missouri.” ⁠ 03 In fact, I never hear it when being introduced to a fellow frosh, because I know all 10 of us Missourians by face and name. In my first month here alone, I had at least three people ask me where Missouri was. I had someone open their notes app upon meeting me and type a checkmark emoji next to Missouri, saying they were trying to meet someone from every state. I had someone say I give Texas vibes, not Missouri vibes; I’m not entirely sure whether that was a compliment or not, but I think it was probably intended as one. I went through several hours and a box of
 
microwaved pad thai ⁠ 04 I asked some random Simmons residents whether you were supposed to leave the lid on your tupperware when you microwaved something, to a chorus of concerned “no, what?”'s. some 
stuff going for it, ⁠ 05 notably, the invention of ice cream cones, toasted ravioli, Panera, Grant's Farm (which is not actually that much of a landmark and I've never even been there), etc. All jokes aside, it’s weird for me to be defensive or fond of where I was raised; it’s so different from where I live now, and where I will continue to live for the next four years. It still doesn’t sit quite right with me when I refer to my dorm room as “home.” My old… “home,” or neighborhood, was established, timely, if the towering, thick oak trees were anything to go by. There weren’t any sidewalks, only a convoluted maze of pavement with occasional barricades that warned of children crossing. The house numbers made no sense, and the driveways were tens of meters long. When we first moved there, our neighbors brought brownies and sat and chatted for a while. I forgot I was supposed to send them a thank you card, and by the time I remembered, an awkward amount of time had already elapsed. I haven’t talked to any of them since. It’s by all means a very nice neighborhood. But the more I stayed in it, the more I recognized the archetypal loneliness of American suburbia in its manicured lawns and white wood fences. Still, so many parts of St. Louis became constants to me. Highway 64 was just a block away, giving me easy access to art class and the West County Mall if I drove west, and Olive Supermarket and the Forest Park golf course if I drove east. There was the guy in my grade who I was chummy with for a brief while, before the jitterings of social anxiety got the best of me and I ghosted him. There was the lady with the two biggest, prettiest dogs I’ve ever seen. There was the mom parked in the Volvo right by the entrance of the neighborhood every afternoon waiting to pick up her child, which reminds me of how
 
I’d once wake up at 5:50 every morning ⁠ 06 but now it takes every ounce of willpower in my body to get out of bed at my 8:30a.m. alarm In the weeks before I came to Cambridge, I was driving down Price Rd. to get onto Olive Blvd. and I couldn’t help but think about how I probably will never again make this drive once I leave for college. The same post-8th-period drive that my friends and I would take, crammed into somebody’s car after fighting for shotgun/aux privileges, to get boba at the shop I used to work at. I couldn’t help but think about how the roads I was just starting to get intimately familiar with, in spite of my extremely poor navigational abilities, will be replaced with new streets and highways and shuttle stops I’ll have to memorize. I couldn’t help but think about how much I’ll miss these constants when I’m lost in a new city, because it’s not my Highway 64, not my Price Rd., not my Olive Blvd. anymore. My old room’s walls were aggressively beige and the bedframe was extraordinarily bland, because I never really got around to decorating my room. The large, blank walls were too intimidating for me to try and fill. Other than the small army of teddy bears I had on the left side of my bed, I guess I just never felt like the two or so years I had before I moved to college was enough time to really make the room feel like mine. My parents never let me get the cat I’ve always wanted, probably for the same reason. I’d be moving soon enough, and then the poor cat would be in custody of my younger brother, which, okay yeah I can see why my parents didn’t want that to happen.  Now that I’ve settled into my dorm and plastered my art and posters all over the tiny wallspace and petted every cat I’ve seen on campus, I wonder if someday I’ll think about coming “home” only to realize it isn’t my “home” anymore.

Like many I’ve talked to, I’m still stuck a couple years before me. In my case, that’s 10th grade, right before COVID hit. Senior year was a blur, and junior year basically never existed. I forgot that I graduated from grade school. Ironically, it’s really starting to hit me that I’m now a college student. Not only do I have a bunch of clubs and classes to do, I also have to figure out how to balance that with keeping myself alive. Can you believe that? I have to remember to drink water. (Speaking of which, here’s a friendly reminder to go get water.) I’m stuck in a bit of a situation where I’m weirdly better at the things I used to suck at (ie. waking up early, keeping my room organized, doing laundry regularly), and worse at the things I used to do automatically (ie. drinking water, eating food, turning off the lights before I sleep). Even so, some things never change, like how terrible I am at organizing stuff. I have tried to start using a google calendar, but it’s not completely filled in yet. as i walk into the giant 10-250 lecture hall for 3.091, i become deeply confuzzled as it suddenly hits me that i’m actually in college. I made friends, and I’m still making new ones! I used to be good at names in middle school, but that’s taken a nosedive since then. I can remember names and faces separately, with no connection in between the two. But even though I have the memory of a lobotomized goldfish, people are really nice about it, which is why I shamelessly ask them over and over again, sometimes multiple times within the same sitting. I’ve never regularly gone clothes shopping or grocery shopping with friends before coming to college. I went to Garment District the other day, and the five of us spent a good while trying on trench coats, putting shark heads on each other and crafting the most ridiculous outfit possible. While I was looking through the racks for pants, Leek came out of the dressing room wearing high heels with their oversized T-shirt horrendously tucked into the knee folds of a pair of flare bottom jeans. Worse, it seemed like we were legitimately considering buying it. I found a cargo vest and a hooded jean jacket to put into my wardrobe, which previously consisted of only T-shirts and sweatpants, and I’m proud to say that I no longer look basic. But that’s debatable relative to the style of several people I’ve met at East Campus (and West campus as well). Regularly, a bunch of my friends hold something called “frosh tea time,” which usually, but not always, involves tea. Sometimes it’s a pset party, or just a regular late night hangout. Our numbers usually range anywhere from 5 to 15-ish people. The day before the career fair, a group of us got together and started slapping together our resumes, skillfully embellishing our wondrous accomplishments from high school. What started out as an impromptu workshop in a group room at Hayden Library quickly turned into a cram session in Talbot Lounge with cups of iced tea to stay awake and boba that one of us cooked. Arthur sent us an overleaf resume template, which I proceeded to format very badly because I didn’t know how to use LaTex. Not knowing how many booths we can realistically talk to, we each printed 25 to 30 copies, with Powell topping the list at a whopping 40. And though I don’t know why the printers broke the next day, I like to think that it was because people were printing stuff out last minute for the career fair. A couple days after that, we stayed up until late again studying for the upcoming physics exams. The lot of us got distracted belting out musical soundtracks from hammocks and double decker sofas, but such is frosh tea time. Making friends in college is drastically different from high school. You get closer to each other a lot quicker when you share the same living space and interact with them more often outside of school. When you get to see people all hours of the day, when they’re happy, sad, stressed, and dramatically dancing to an hour long loop of that one Morbius song playing in the lounge, friends no longer feel one dimensional. It’s refreshing in a really nice way. sitting around a fire with friends at the end of the day. immaculate vibes  rice cooker (it’s really cute) and among other things, adapting to the chaos that comes with living away from home. a ketchup plizzy Remember, Ziploc bags also make great tupperware! Two days ago, I finally managed to do one pull-up. I probably couldn’t do it again if you asked me to, but it sure happened. I have the stamina of a diseased rat and very noodly arms, but I’m strangely improving after coming to MIT. Although I came here for tech and tinkering, between the rock climbing, building, walking to and from classes and food in Boston, the pullup bar in Tetazoo, fire spinning, as well as climbing many many stairs on a daily basis, I think I might actually gain some muscle. By the end of my four years here, I think I’ll at least be a couple pull-ups consistently. I’ve been described as having very strong frosh energy. Scared frosh, confused frosh, excited frosh, too-much-energy frosh— I have all the bases covered. There are just so many things happening all at once that emotional regulation sometimes just flies out the window. It’s so fun always having stuff to do, but when there’s perpetually something better to do than sleeping, you get thrown off balance. When sleep deprivation becomes habit, it becomes more difficult to invest time into doing the things you like. Especially because I live in East Campus where three shopping trips, a party, and a new building project are happening every week, it’s difficult coming to terms with the fact that I can’t always do everything I want to. I’m still constantly running from pset deadlines, and laundry still needs to be washed. This wide range of reactions to new things is fun though. When the year goes on and I become inevitably more tired, I still hope to be just as excited about new experiences as I am right now at the beginning of the year. Classes have barely started, but through FPOPs, orientation, and meeting new people, I’ve already changed a lot since high school. I’ve been a lot less afraid of being judged for just about anything and everything I do, from my usual demeanor, to how I dress and how I talk to others. It’s a bit of a vague description, because I’m still figuring out exactly what’s different myself.

I do not know if I have mentioned this on the blogs or in public, ever, but I am  actually majoring in mechanical engineering 
build as much ⁠ 01 actually I think each building project is like a sidequest: fully unnecessary and a lot of work, but also what is the point of the game if you do zero sidequests? I do not know. I haven’t played games for years I learned new things with every project, so here’s a list of the 10 most useful lessons. 1.  Lightning-bolt earrings What do they represent?  “Those are sick Killers earrings,” said a MechE friend. We bond over a shared love for the Killers. David Bowie, a postdoc at my lab suggested. Another postdoc brought up a video game character I had never heard of. “Oh my god, you actually made Harry Potter earrings,” said my little sister.  In truth, I’d thought of zero of these things. I simply had some copper plate and a bandsaw in front of me, and I’d learned recently that bandsaws, unlike scroll saws, don’t cut curves too well. The lightning bolt was all straight lines.  Once I had the lightning bolts, I wanted to connect the earring ring to the back via solder wire. Solder doesn’t take to every type of metal the same way (especially when your flux keeps evaporating), and copper and pseudo-brass aren’t the best of matches; but ultimately I was able to get it to stick, and voila, earrings! This was probably the first project that travelled around half-finished in my backpack until I happened upon the equipment I needed to finish it; in this case, a
 
soldering iron. ⁠ 02 they seemed much rarer back in September, before I had access to as many makerspaces, or realized many of my friends had one in their dorm room 2. trapeze lyra and trapeze hanging in east campus Fundamentally, a trapeze is a simple system. There is a bar held up by two ropes, with padding around the bar-rope joints to protect your joints. The only tricky part is sewing the padding together. The padding is fairly thick and therefore must be done by hand, and also needs to adhere to the rope. I used foam, which worked, though if I re-make this I’ll go for fabric scraps next time. I learned some basic things, like how to burn the ends of ropes so that they do not fray, and how to operate a mill. I also learned what a strap wrench is — see below — which is incredibly useful for when the collet on a mill gets stuck. I *love* these! they make you so strong This was also when I realized that I can be real bad at asking for help. Being independent is a good habit generally, but it isn’t super useful when, for instance, the mill collet gets stuck, and you aren’t sure if you just need to apply a lot more force unscrewing it, or if something went wrong. I was working on a persnickety mill, so a couple of problems that could be easy fixes kept cropping up, and I, new to milling, wasn’t sure how to fix them. Each time, I wasted a good bit of time before asking a shop mentor. By the end I had resolved to work on this and learn to ask for guidance when I needed. As it turns out, extra force was often the key; hence the strap wrench, which grips round objects tighter than human hands.  3. abc costume This one was
 
fun!! ⁠ 03 also the longest section, whoops There is a yearly ABC (Anything But Clothes) party which people make costumes for — this year saw a lot of covid bags taped or stapled together. My friends made really cool costumes from duct tape and ziploc bags filled with miscellaneous objects and snacks. I made ragtag bikini armor, like the heroines from fantasy paperbacks in the 1970’s. As a cross country runner, I have poured hours of research into sports bra mechanics. Bikini armor felt like something I was uniquely suited to make. I cut a bra pattern into a sheet of aluminum and began to shape the cups. It was surprisingly easy. The main trick was cutting down the aluminum so that it fit. This was early October, when I was new to shops. An alum I’d not met before came up and started offering me advice — repeatedly, despite the fact that he didn’t know much more about bending metal than I did. In fairness, I  was  new. Still, there were a lot of new people, most of them men, and he wasn’t returning again and again to offer help to them. I was one of few women in the shop. I was making bikini armor. I didn’t need help, but I didn’t know how to tell him I would be better served if he didn’t waste my time. The alum told me he’d seen on Youtube some years ago that you can hammer rounded objects into sheet metal to round out the
 
sheet ⁠ 04 he wasn’t entirely wrong; since then I’ve seen the technique used correctly in the forge Looking at the rod, I knew in my gut that it would not work, and I should not say yes. “Yeah, sure.” It did not work! The alum didn’t round out the sheet at all, just left a dent somewhat smaller than a dime. At that point I said that I’d prefer to work alone and took my project back. He slinked away. I don’t remember seeing him again. I took the rounded rod and made a line of tiny dents, hoping it would look intentional.  In fact the end product looked messy, as ABC costumes do, and the lights were too low for anyone to see the dents. This was a fairly low-cost way to cement the importance of setting boundaries around your projects and learning process. I’m much better at that now;  I want the scars in my projects to be from my own learning, not someone else’s mistake. The vast majority of people in the shops around MIT, of any gender, have been respectful and welcoming. I’ve learned a lot from mentors and friends who share their knowledge. But when that isn’t the case, it’s okay to say, thanks, but I’ve got it. I know what I’m doing.  Anyway I was like ‘wow! Metal can just be bent how you want it to be! That’s kinda cool yo.’ Cutting copper or steel on a lathe or a mill made sense — hard materials require big machines. But metal is ultimately just a material, one which holds its shape and bends under the right amount of force. Sometimes it takes a great deal of force — but sometimes it doesn’t. You can make the right shape with your hands.  4. bike We welded bikes in a  D-Lab class I learned how to weld, as well as how to use a tap and die, how to sandblast, and a lot of bike mechanics. This was the class where I realized there is a distinction between being taugh t a new skill and practicing it enough to do it on your own. Since this class, I have been trying to make sure that after I learn a new skill, I repeat it enough to solidify it before the training wears off. 5. blacksmithing I’ve written a whole  blog 
intimidating. ⁠ 05 I’m now taking an ironwork class with one of them! He's still a little intimidating but also wry and funny. Between welding, grinding down welds, and blacksmithing, I had my second epiphany of “metal just  moves .” You can change it. You heat it up and hammer it and suddenly you have a leaf, a hook, a spiral, when before you just had a cold rod of iron.  I learned many blacksmithing techniques, like making bottle openers, leaves, and twists, and also forge welding. Here are some objects I made: Previous Next 6. lyra For my fall  ProjX I also cut a nd welded the connector joint, cleaned up the metal, and painted it. This was my first welding project that I executed entirely independently. Hanging this is also an exercise in knot-tying and problem-solving, because there are not many designated trapeze-hanging locations on campus. 7. 2.007 robot! 2.007 is a class about building a robot to compete in an end-of-semester competition, which consists of challenges such as pushing various buttons, pulling a pendulum, rings, and Tim the Beaver, and pushing balls into bins. This class and this robot may be a blog unto itself; 2.007 is certainly an experience. he makes the edges of holes not sharp I practiced milling and turning on a lathe, and picked up many new skills: how to waterjet and laser-cut metal, when to use (and not use) epoxy, and the fact that the triangular deburring heads are the
 
best. ⁠ 06 the fact that I like them so much is distinctly stockholm-ish because deburring hurts like a bitch The main takeaways from this class are also planning and design skills: how to set yourself up to build a robot, and what the iteration process looks like. I re-designed one system several times, then integrated that sysem into the robot and saw what the additional weight and different geometry did to the robot’s other capabilities, like driving up a ramp. Driving up a ramp was unsurprisingly much harder, so I played around with how the different modules were integrated, and worked on improving them until the competition rolled around. I learned a lot — my systems at the end came together much faster than at the beginning — and overall building this robot was a highly educational trial by fire. Previous Next 8. laser cut earrings and earring stand I was trained on a laser cutter my freshman year, and I was excited to come back to it! The earrings were for a St Patrick’s Day party, and the display (see below) was drawn up in a harried half-hour before a ProjX presentation when I realized I had no way to array the other earrings and jewelry I’d designed. 9. misc other earrings, ie pennies, wine corks, bottles I make a lotta earrings, and I did my spring ProjX project on earrings from recycled or unlikely materials. I also finally had a drill in my room (thanks 2.007!), so I could now put holes in things when I wanted to, which is vital for jewelry-making. My favorites here were the MIG welder tips and the tiny bottles full of beads. Previous Next 10. the forge stand  This May, I built a stand for a forge to be set up in D-Lab. The shop mentor had drawn up a CAD model, and another student had done a few welds, so my part was to bend the side pieces, complete welding, and compile the frame into a 3-D stand. I figured out how to use square clamps, which was probably the biggest new skill. I worked mostly at night, when other students were in the shop but without mentors present. When the MIG welder malfunctioned, I fixed it; I bent tubes, sanded, grinded, cut and welded — all skills I’d learned this year. When I finished, I left the lab around 1 am. The nights were growing warmer, and you could see a star or two in this light-polluted city if you looked. I felt exhausted but deeply satisfied. The tops of my leather boots were shiny with steel dust. Previous Next I had fun with these projects! It was great to see my learning curve. I have a lot of goals for projects going forth, from adding more electronics and dynamic mechanisms, to figuring out resin printing and embroidery, to working in bigger groups of people and integrating my work with more complex systems. I’m excited for things to pick up this semester! #D-Lab #IDC #machine #makerspace #making #projx #shop

 October 2021. It all started last year when Jonathan H. ’25 asked Nicole H. ’22 and I quote, “ Do you have time to waste? ” He pulled up the  iafisher.com  website which features a series of geography quizzes regarding how many cities you can name in the US, Europe, Asia, Africa or the entire world.  They tried to name all the cities in the US. I wasn’t there for this but he describes it as easily the craziest four hours. They completely decimated west New York and Jess H. ’24 named the craziest cities in Arizona.   Last week.  This came back around again when David H. ’25 asked Jonathan if he could name all the  major US sports teams . This included baseball, basketball, hockey and
 
football. ⁠ 01 American football, he adds September 17, 2022. Saturday morning around 2:30 am, after a game of trying to name all the sports teams in which I was just a spectator, we decided to try to name all the cities in the world. The goal when we started was to get to 25% of the world population. We went through each of the continents and tried to name all the cities we could remember at 3 in the morning. At one point, Jonathan was scribbling down cities on a paper, I was going through the alphabet written down on a whiteboard trying to remember any cities I could and Alan Z. ’23 was typing in the smallest cities they knew. This included Lost Springs, WY with a total population of six people as of the 2020 census.    Around 4:13 am, we had gotten to  25% of the world population September 18, 2022. On Sunday, before celebrating
 
the birthdays of Katie K. ’24 and Justin Y. ’25, ⁠ 02 it’s a 4W tradition to celebrate the birthdays for all the people in the wing. we buy a cake, sing our own version of happy birthday and take a selfie! 33% Going through the cities we missed, we resolved to come prepared next time. We had planned for people to go over their respective areas of expertise, usually where they are from.  We advertised in the
 
4W ⁠ 03 the floors in Next House are divided into two wings: East and West. i live on the west wing of the fourth floor. Misremembering the time of this great activity, I had planned to work with Holden M. ’25 from 9 till 11. Luckily, as I came back to my room, I ran into Alan and they reminded me of the correct time. I rescheduled meeting with Holden from 8:30 to 10 and went through big cities in Pakistan and India multiple times before 8:30. Now, September 24, 2022. I got back to the lounge around 10:20pm and there was clearly a crowd. Presumably, some of the 4W people informed their friends and so we had the geography knowledge of 4W-adjacent people at our disposal too. When I walked in, some of the people were going through cities in Europe and I was, well, amazed. After a day of career fair-ing and student holiday-ing, people had come together in the main lounge for a night of
 
city-naming. ⁠ 04 Wow, isn’t this sentence the epitome of literature? Jonathan’s laptop was connected to the TV in the lounge and he was streaming on Discord for the quarantining folks. This time, there was more order as we went through different areas and continents one at a time.  I decided it would be best if I wrote all the cities down somewhere so I started erasing the whiteboard but halfway through, Katie K. ’24 pointed out that I erased the Liechtenstein cities Andrew L. ’24 had especially prepared for and written
 
down. ⁠ 05 Don’t worry, we recovered the cities. Disappointed in myself, I resorted instead to my iPad and started writing down all the cities I could remember. I went back to my room before we got to Asia but they saved Pakistan for me. When I came back, people were going through California. Right after, I was offered the keyboard. Jonathan read out the cities from my list and I typed them in, slowly and badly. This list included Ziarat, a city with less than 800 people but not Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. After someone pointed this out, we were at around 34%.  Previous Next It was past 1 am by now, meaning we had thrown all sanity out our defenestration-friendly window. I could try to write elaborate paragraphs and superfluous words to describe what happened next, but I think these snippets do a much better job than I ever can at capturing the pure chaos.   –  Jonathan picks up a brownie from the floor like you pick up someone’s abandoned sock in the laundry and asks, “Is this someone’s brownie? I will eat it.”
 06 He didn’t actually do it.  – I finally download the mentori sticker pack that Matthew H. ’25 introduced me to and we send
 
every single of them ⁠ 07 There’s about 30 of them  – “NO, WE ALREADY HAVE MOSCOW, IDAHO. WE ALREADY HAVE MOSCOW, TEXAS.” “WE WANNA GO TO BED.”  – Jonathan has been writing and collecting cities on a napkin. He loses one of his pens. He declares that we should build a new version of this which is better in the sense that it allows multiple people to enter the cities at the same time and hence, saves a lot of time.   –  “How can you be dumb when you are crimes?” “There are dumb crimes.”  – After 3 hours 31 minutes 34.24 seconds, we have successfully named  2124 cities  in the world which corresponds to 36.90% of the world’s urban population! People declare their exhaustion with the current state of the website and say they would not want to do this again unless it is improved. That is, for the next group activity, we should work on improving the website.   – We are talking about
 
selenium. ⁠ 08 I would explain what this means but. I don't know.  – There is some conversation about ingressive and egressive
 
hhaup’s. ⁠ 09 A chomping sound that has become quite prevalent around the wing.  – Carl S. ’23: “Okay, time to download selenium.”  Apparently, we are doing it right now!   – Alan says, “I have written my code.” Addendum by Jeffery L. ’23, “There is a Vincent, California.”  – “We made this work!”  – Initial testing is successful but there are some bugs if inputs are fast enough.  – “In what situation would it make city a float?” “In this case, we will guess the city NaN.” Will we figure this out today? I’m pretty sure, but that’s a story for another day!

Among my defining personality traits are playing 2048 in the year of our lord 2022 — many people have made fun of me for this, but it’s like a fidget toy for me at this point — as well as baking banana bread, and being the number one Carly Rae Jepsen fan in most of my social circles. Like most people,   was my first exposure to Carly Rae Jepsen. For some reason, the
 
sixth graders ⁠ 01 because for some other reason, my elementary school went up to sixth grade instead of ending at fifth In fourth grade,   was the song that the sixth graders decided to do a flash mob to. And then afterwards, I went home, logged onto my dad’s PC and looked up the  music video. (And also, whenever I bring up the fact that there’d be flash mobs at my elementary school, people look at me funny. It   kind of weird. In fifth grade, the sixth graders did the  , but there weren’t any cool songs that came out in  year, except   by Pharrell Williams, which is an inherently annoying song, and also the teachers had already done a video to it so we couldn’t do it. I think we ended up doing some boring song, proved by the fact that I can’t even remember what it was.) I feel like Carly Rae Jepsen just had a large impact on everyone’s psyche in elementary school. I was talking about her with my friend Rui and she told me how Carly came to her school for some sort of concert, and when she sang  Anyway, her album E•MO•TION came out in middle school. I remember coming across it on my shiny new Spotify account and listening to  
geometry class ⁠ 02 my least favorite class in middle school. i feel like you're either an algebra or geometry person, and i was definitely an algebra person. funnily enough, when i was a little kid my mom took me to get iq tested and the guy told me that i had poor spatial reasoning skills, which meant i'd be bad at physics and geometry. i guess he was right, because i am not in fact the biggest fans of those subjects Honestly, I thought being a hardcore Carly fan was just one of those things I’d have to defend to others until I met Alex and Ace in 2020 and she dropped  Dedication Side B Recently, by virtue of talking about Carly Rae Jepsen enough around her and making her an intro playlist with some Carly essentials, I’ve gotten Chris into a few of her songs, namely  , and  . And then we went to the Carly concert on Monday. carly outfit hehe (featuring my cringe MIT ID photo that i’ve been meaning to update for a whileeee) “I need to look so hot for Carly Rae Jepsen that she’ll come down to the stage and give me a kiss on the forehead,” I told Chris. It was at the  Roadrunner Also, apparently one of August’s friends was also at the Boston concert? The opener was  Empress Of And holy shit did she make an entrance. August has seen Carly live before, and what they told me is that along with Japanese Breakfast, she’s got one of the brightest voices they’ve ever heard. She definitely lived up to those words. She’s got   a mesmerizing stage presence. After she sang  Julien , which is about how she’ll never forget some guy named Julien, she was like, “I don’t even know where that boy is now!” Icon. Queen. I love her. And then for her last song,  Cut To The Feeling , she somehow obtained a Minecraft diamond sword from someone in the audience and she was waving it around as she was singing. Again, an icon. Overall? One of the best concerts I’ve ever been to, and my favorite night so far this semester. I’m paying the price for spending Monday night having fun instead of doing psets — I just spent six hours camping at  Nu Delta 
6.046 ⁠ 03 i really don't know how anyone would survive 6.046 by themselves unless they were super insanely cracked at algorithms, which i am not, so i'm glad i'm taking it with a bunch of friends Thank you Carly Slay Jepsen for healing my inner middle schooler. (And here’s her setlist from the Boston show!)

A few weeks ago, MIT —  in conjunction with Stanford, IBM, and Aeris Communications —  filed an
 
amicus brief ⁠ 01 For those less familiar with American litigation practices, an amicus brief — from the Latin for <em>friend, </em>also known as ‘friend-of-the-court’ — is filed by entities not themselves parties to the lawsuit in question, but that have a stake or insight into the matter before the Court. MIT had previously filed similar briefs in prior Supreme Court cases having to do with affirmative action, most recently <em>Fisher v. University of Texas </em>back in 2015 (<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/mit-joins-supreme-court-amicus-brief-supporting-race-admissions-1102">brief</a>). two cases As MIT’s
 
Office of General Counsel ⁠ 02 Our lawyers. statement [This brief asks] the Court to uphold over 40 years of precedent allowing colleges and universities to consider race as one of many factors in admissions. The joint academic/industry brief addresses (1) the vital role that diversity, including racial diversity, plays in achieving the educational missions of institutions of higher education for all students, with particular focus on STEM fields; (2) the importance of diversity to our nation’s success in the global economy; and (3) why consideration of race as one among many factors in the admission of students to selective STEM degree programs is essential to achieve these critical educational goals. As the brief explains, “Not only does diversity contribute to better outcomes for students in STEM — it contributes to better science. As such, American businesses at the forefront of innovation in STEM depend on the availability of a diverse cross-section of talented graduates from the nation’s most rigorous and elite institutions.” Affirmative action is legally complicated, politically controversial, and widely misunderstood. Under the currently controlling precedent,  (2003) to the extent —  and only for the   —  that it is “narrowly tailored…to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body” by ensuring there is a “critical mass” of students from underrepresented backgrounds, and  if they can demonstrate that no other workable methods can achieve that critical mass. We’ve written about how we think about the goals of creating a diverse and talented MIT in many posts and pages over the years, including  here here here diversity statement committee holistic admissions process In making undergraduate admissions decisions, MIT does not and cannot rely on grades and test scores alone…[Indeed] MIT regularly denies admission to individuals with very high grades and scores in considering the sum total of all distinctive qualities sought in its students. In selecting the students who will be offered admission, MIT does not use any quotas or targets, and does not engage in racial or ethnic balancing. Instead, MIT considers all aspects of each candidate’s background, including racial and ethnic factors (on a non-determinative basis) among many other factors both qualitative and quantitative. This individual, holistic and contextualized assessment of each applicant has proven to be the most effective way to discern an applicant’s talent and potential. If this is a topic you care about, I would encourage you to  read the amicus brief Additionally, last week, the MIT leadership announced our  Strategic Action Plan for
 
Belonging, Achievement, and Composition. ⁠ 03 The report notes: "We use the terms belonging, achievement, and composition in this plan because they better reflect how MIT defines community, its focus, and its values than the more commonly used inclusion, equity, and diversity." I’ve started thinking about it as "the ABC report," in the sense that the ABCs are foundational for education. executive summary says MIT has offered generations of people the opportunity to change the trajectory of their lives, develop their full potential, and have an impact in the world. Yet the Institute is part of a society in which opportunity is not evenly distributed and in which not all people feel their contributions are valued. To more fully live up to its mission and increase its impact, MIT will continue increasing the diversity and sense of belonging in its community, removing barriers to opportunity, and shaping an environment in which all people can do their best work and thrive. If you’re interested in the concrete goals MIT is setting for itself, and the strategies it plans to take to undertake them, you can  download the plan These conversations aren’t easy. They cut to the core of the hardest issues —  of identity, of justice, of resources, and how we ought to make a common world together. We do not know yet how the Supreme Court will rule in these cases that govern the work of admissions, or if the Strategic Action Plan will succeed on the terms it has set. But I’m glad that MIT is sharing its reasoning in both cases to help inform and advance a broader public understanding of the issues at stake as we see them. As I’ve often said in my information sessions: the word “institution” comes from the Latin for “custom, or way of habit” —  and the way of habit for MIT, at its best, is  in the public interest.

特别的爱给特别的你 
我的寂寞逃不过你的眼睛 This summer, during
 
my three-month internship in Seattle, ⁠ 01 which I will describe to you in painful detail in a later post. One of our many stops that weekend was the Richmond Night Market, a local attraction full of Asian food stalls and all of sorts of other small booths selling various trinkets, like jewelry, stuffed animals, so on and so forth. Unfortunately, the market was also cash-only, and we had not brought enough
 
Canadian dollars ⁠ 02 which we consistently referred to as 'fake money' throughout our trip. Something about this performance stopped me in my tracks, even though the first two songs were sung in Cantonese, a language I cannot understand. It was something about the fact that there were five Chinese people who had just decided to make music together, in this world where such “frivolous” endeavors are often discouraged. The last song they sang was a song in Mandarin from the 1990s called “特别的爱给特别的你”, commonly translated as “Special Love for Special You”. I had never heard it before, but as the choruses repeated, I began to sing along. When we left, I felt like my heart had been opened anew. Liebst du um Liebe, 
O ja, mich liebe! 
Liebe mich immer, 
Dich lieb’ ich immerdar. I am once again  busier than ever

By every account, this class should be a terrible experience, but by the end of every rehearsal, I emerge renewed, ready to face the day ahead of me. There is something transformative about making art in a group, about the way the voices complement each other into something we call music, something that makes one  feel so utterly alive Last year, the Chamber Chorus performed an arrangement of Clara Schumann’s “Liebst du um Schönheit” for 21M.011, MIT’s Intro to Western Music class. The piece is lovely and yet utterly tranquil, and afterwards, the professor of the class asked us “how do you get into the calm headspace for music outside of the insanity of MIT?” One-by-one, the choir members answered that music is exactly the escape which brings us into that calm headspace. It is the way we free ourselves from the overwhelming nature of our day-to-day lives. Yet, when the winds blew against you, you were powerless to stop them. If she was a piercing gust of air, cold and calculating, ready to cut through you with just a few words, then he was a derecho rushing across the plains, blasting through the landscape with full force. Outside of Chamber Chorus, I am taking

three technicals ⁠ 07 on database systems, computer system architecture, and computer security.

Much of the satisfaction of writing comes in the moment of reception, rather than the moment of creation, which can often be delayed days, or weeks, or months. Sometimes, I do feel very alone. I meet once a week with Fatima N. ’25 to discuss the poems we’ve written that week, and once a week with my (auto)biography class to
 
discuss our pieces, ⁠ 09 among a litany of other subjects. Despite, this,  I keep writing

To be clear, I am not good at Chinese, and the poem (included above) is also not good, but, the process of writing it was incredibly difficult and revealing. Because of the tight constraints of writing a poem in 20 or 28 characters (not to mention the rhyme and tone constraints), grammatical subjects and context necessary to establish tense are often missing, creating this weird and eerie sense of timelessness. The information density of a good, classic Chinese poem is this truly incredible, magical experience. I think I am not sure I have an answer to this question, except to say that we will have to continue living, and find out where the art takes us. I am not sure I will have the energy to keep on making things, although perhaps I am underestimating myself in that regard. Sometimes, however, I think about the cover band at the Richmond Night Market. I think about five people on a stage, making music, having the time of their life, and sometimes, I think it will be okay.

: This is a guest post by my friend Mitali C. ’24, a course 20 and a very lovely soul, who I invited to write a post anytime. This is the wonderful result, reflecting on the midpoint of a journey through MIT as well as a collection of significant places Mitali frequented. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! It has hit me that I have officially completed two years at MIT, and I plan to graduate after I finish four years here. Two divided by four is one half, and that’s a little terrifying. But it’s also a bit of a comfortable spot to do some reflecting and planning ahead. Without further ado, here’s some places I’ve been and some things I’ll be doing.  a map of Boston with major water bodies because I enjoy being by them and the T lines because I like trains. oh, and the places I’ll be talking about, because I guess that’s relevant The first time I went to the end of a T line was when some of my podmates and I went out to Alewife. We hadn’t seen much of Boston, and it was an enthralling new experience to sit on the subway for so long. We ate lunch together in the nature reserve and walked around a bit before the ride back to campus, listening to the song  Alewife by Clairo. Sometimes MIT still feels so novel, and I find myself thinking of my high school friends and hobbies as my “old” life while college is “new.” But it’s hitting me that this is the halfway point now, and some of these new college things are now relatively old. I have a hard time letting go, but I’m also excited to try new things. For the first four semesters of MIT, this has led to piling on more and more clubs, social commitments, classes, and responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, this ended up being a bad idea. I finished out sophomore year with an unreasonably packed schedule, yet couldn’t name a single thing I felt dedicated to. I was burnt out by my longer term hobbies, stressed by the new activities, and all around unsatisfied. I’ve thought a lot about how to make the next half of MIT feel better, and concluded that I need to say “no” to more things. Especially when this means stepping away from what I love, it seems a bit counterintuitive, but I’ll have a lot more energy to enjoy what I do. I hope that this also keeps balance in my social life, since I’m meeting new people while having more time to spend with my old friends. Maybe I’ll go back to Alewife with new friends, and explore a new town with my podmates. Haymarket: self love is self care After months of hearing about the Haymarket farmers’ market, I finally went to check it out. The first couple of times I went I was entirely overwhelmed. It was crowded, loud, and smelly. One vendor almost knocked me over with a giant box of bananas as I stood there, frozen in the midst of all the hustle happening around me. After that, I didn’t go back to Haymarket until the summer, when a friend and I bought boxes of strawberries for a dollar each. It was a sweltering hot day, so we retreated to my air conditioned room and made nice, cool glasses of strawberry milk. We marveled at the cheap, fresh produce we had gotten, and at how much better this was than store bought drinks. I promised that we would go to Haymarket more often during  the semester. Now that the rhythm of the semester is starting to set in, we’re actually planning on going this weekend, and I’m really looking forward to the trip. unflattering picture of the best strawberry milk i’ve ever had Grocery shopping becoming one of my favorite activities was certainly not something I expected from college. But now I realize that college isn’t just about academic learning.  A huge part of it has been learning how to be an adult and take care of myself. I’ve spent a lot of the past year especially focused on building healthy habits, like going to the gym regularly and making balanced meals. Sometimes it’s really tedious, but as I’ve cemented these habits, they have become important cornerstones in my day to day life. And doing this self care right is an excellent gift to myself, whether that is waking up feeling well rested, getting a delicious homemade meal, or listening to my favorite music while I work out. I faltered a lot on these habits as things got busy throughout the semesters, but I really hope to maintain them better from now on. The summer has been really excellent for rediscovering the joy in listening to my needs and treating myself, and I’m excited to build on these self care routines as an upperclassman. Harvard Bridge: there’s always time to watch the sunset I can’t remember the first time I crossed the Harvard Bridge into Boston, but by now, I’ve crossed too many times to count. For the summer, I lived at tEp and it was a blast. In addition to the fun social events, nightly dinner, and adorable cats, I took advantage of being so close to downtown Boston. Whenever I needed to go to work or campus, I crossed the river back into Cambridge across the Harvard Bridge. Sometimes, this was a curse, like on sunny 100 degree days, or on windy days that I chose to wear a hat. But other times, it was a blessing. Besides being a pleasant walk, the bridge has a gorgeous view, and the sunsets over the river never fail to impress. My camera roll for the summer consists almost entirely of cats and sunsets. Previous Next I didn’t spend a lot of time at tEp last year because it was “too far” to go most days. Each time I did go I grumbled about how much of the walk was just the bridge. But having done the walk many times this summer, I have grown to appreciate it a lot more. These next couple of years, I want to stop over-optimizing my days to try and expend minimal energy, and take opportunities like longer walks to just relax and take in the beauty of the world around me. I’ve been noticing that blocking out large chunks of time to work on homework results in me wasting most of that time. On the other hand, if I let myself have fun or do whatever I feel like doing sprinkled around the work time, I get a similar amount done without feeling guilty for wasting time. My goal is to change what I optimize for and get more satisfaction out of the time I put into my classwork and clubs. As of now, the most concrete way I plan on doing this is by going to more office hours, getting more learning out of every hour I spend on my psets. And that way, I’ll have my evenings free to watch the sunset over the river. Allston: mistakes are just spontaneous adventures One summer evening, after a long day of work, I wanted to take the bus back to tEp. Without any kind of planning ahead, I left the office and saw a bus going past me. No big deal – the bus comes often enough. I got to the bus stop and looked up a bus schedule to see that the next one was… over thirty minutes away. This stop, fortunately, was also a stop for other T lines, and one of the other buses pulled up. Without hesitation, I got on the bus, and then looked at the bus map to see where I was going. I ended up by BU 10 minutes later, where I got off the bus and bought some groceries, then took the green line the rest of the way back. I found myself on a new bus line one other day after work too, when I had ordered some boba from a nearby store before realizing that the store location was, in fact, in Allston, which is 30 minutes away from the office. Once again, I took a spontaneous adventure out to a new part of Boston and then took the Green Line back to tEp. Throughout the first half of MIT, I feel like I’ve made my fair share of mistakes. I mess up lab procedures because I don’t pay attention, say yes to too many commitments, and forget to stir something that I have on the stove. But from each mistake, I learn something new, and now I’m getting better at double checking procedures, balancing my life with the need to rest, and turning the heat down  before #guest post

People in dorms with dining halls occasionally ask me, “So in East Campus, what do you eat?” My answers have varied, from “Free food!” to “A lot of things,” to “Uhh… I mean… I certainly did. I actually have no idea what.” At one point I turned to a friend and said, bro, what  did  I… You get the point. So now, I am conducting an anthropological study on what I eat. This is partly out of curiosity toward my own collegiate habits, and also to show frosh and prospective future frosh how free food culture can be
 
leveraged. ⁠ 01 though y'all who experienced CPW and REX already understand Trust me, y’all, I learned from the best. Beast (2E) has food on the free food table nearly every day of the week. A few tips: always be prepared to consume free food, if you so desire it’s free! saves time and makes meals a social activity gather friends who will go to free food events with you or make new friends at said events! this is also great because y’all can take each other to events only one of you has access to, such as events put on by cultural clubs.  plan ahead for free food events I have email notifications on my phone. When I see an event I want to go to, I chuck it in my calendar with the event name and room number. Some notifications come from  [email protected] disclaimer: this is from the first week of classes, meaning many clubs were serving food at their first meetings in order to lure in new members. This level of living off of free food may not be constant. However, I don’t think it’s far from the norm. Sloan event inside a big tent on kresge! Friday 9.9 :  Eggs and steak, stolen from the dining hall during REX, when MIT gave free meal plans to the upperclassmen who returned early to volunteer. I froze a handful of meals to save for later. Rating: turns out that defrosted eggs taste terrible, 3/10, would not recommend. Healthy, though. I also had some refried beans and half a granola bar, which I paid for. : I was in the IDC and there were wraps on trays in front of us. I snatched one! Yum. : I went to a Sloan event where startups were showcasing their products! There was a free open bar, and people carrying trays of hors d’oeuvres. Excellent event, 10/10, would recommend. My only complaint is that I had safety glasses hanging from my belt and they fell out and I lost them. free meals so far: 3 Saturday 9.10 I woke up feeling rather sick, rough days out here. It wasn’t covid, and it cleared up in the afternoon. :  ordered ubereats. I feel guilty about this since it was hella expensive — another thought for another blog, I guess — but I felt much less deceased afterwards. I paired the meal with seltzer stolen from a lab earlier this week. : I did some work, then went to the BC re-opening party, where there was so much free food! They had a table with fruits and cheese and, inexplicably, a bucket of shrimp. There were also food trucks for ice cream sandwiches and Mexican food. free meal count: 5 cake from the BC event Sunday 9.11  burrito from the free food truck on Friday lunch:  : A few friends and I were going camping, which pulled us away from MIT’s campus and all the free food there. Instead we ate hot dogs and marshmallows, your typical camping fare. free meal count: 7 Monday 9.12 : camp food, and an energy drink I guzzled on the way back. I loved camping. We arrived not long before sunset, and committed to summitting at night. We donned headlamps and climbed through the mist, often pausing to look for the next trail sign: a spray-painted white circle, or cross, gleaming under our lights. I felt like I was in another world, even though we were just two hours north of MIT. a friend and I were texting about the abundant free food, and how they had an extra serving of fried noodles because they kept getting free food at events — then lo and behold, they gave me half the noodles!  I wouldn’t count this as exactly free, since they paid for ingredients. I also had a banana from the banana lounge. Tuesday 9.13 I woke up late and snagged a bagel at the cafe in Lobby 7. for dinner I had the last of my leftovers from the BC food trucks. For after dinner snacks, I went to a climate-focused career fair at  Greentown Labs The career fair was amazing; it was much smaller than MIT’s annual career fair, but more of the companies suited my interests, and it was cool to see how many climate-focused startups are growing in Cambridge. free snack count: 2 Wednesday 9.14 : for the first time this week, I cooked a meal! It was supposed to be eggs and veggies, but I forgot to get eggs, so it was in fact just veggies. I added some other salad-shaped veggies as well, since keeping this list made me realize my vegetable serving count was sorely lacking. Also, kombucha. I had free pizza slices and free leaves at the inaugural meeting of MIT Wind, a club for the DoE  collegiate wind competition The club is just starting out this year, but I knew some of the new members already. The competition seems to encompass a wide variety of areas, from design and prototyping, to building, to networking. I’m excited to see where it goes! vegetable servings count: at least 3 Thursday 9.15 : bagel, not free 
MIXED ⁠ 02 MIT's club for students of mixed-race backgrounds : I met a friend in for dinner at El Jefe’s Boston location  — I am on an inadvertent mission to try all the Mexican food in the Boston area. To no one’s surprise, this one tasted exactly like the Jefe’s near Harvard. Pretty good, would recommend; not free. free meal count: 9 full meals! free snacks count: 3 separate occasions When I tabulated this list for myself, I kept a record of how much money I spent on each non-free item, too. The two times I ate out cost a hefty sum, and I, like many college students, waste too much money buying coffee that I could very well make myself. Other than those costs, free food helped lower my grocery bill quite a bit; I spent about $25 on groceries this week. I realized during the writing of this blog that I am terrible at taking food pics, which is a tragedy. The food this week was quite good, albeit poorly documented. How many vegetables/sources of fiber did I eat? I’m tempted to count burrito toppings as veggies, which probably signals
 
not enough. ⁠ 03 to all the adults who read my blog... pretend you skipped this sentence That wraps up this week. However, I must highlight one massive free food event of the following weekend: the reif rager! There were tents and tents of free food, from donut holes to cuts of salmon, fancy pizza, pulled pork, and a lot more options I missed or didn’t want to stand in line for. I didn’t expect them to keep us fed throughout the dance party, so I was pleasantly surprised by the food tent right beside the dance tent, with tables that were replenished all night.

I encountered the Next House moving carts on my first day at MIT. I remember walking up to the front desk, stomach full of butterflies and a little dread, and awkwardly asking to check-in. After
 
obtaining my key, ⁠ 01 Freshman Shorna was punching the air  I grabbed one of the gigantic moving carts and, somewhat clumsily, maneuvered it to my car. The cart was bright blue, and right before I hoisted my first suitcase into it, I realized with dismay that its floor was slick with a mysterious liquid and peppered with stray hairs.
 
There were also a couple of food wrappers added, for good measure. ⁠ 02 In retrospect, this description makes the decisions I make in the body of this blog post a lot more dubious. Ew.  I quickly piled all of my things into it, my mother tutting loudly as I insisted on moving my things despite
 
my sprained ACL. ⁠ 03 Also a bad choice. I maybe have a problem. I had a brace! Unclear that this makes it <i>that </i>much better, but I did!  I navigated to my temp room
 
(550, in 5East) ⁠ 04 All I really remember thinking about 5E at the time was amazement at the fluorescence of the green walls. Green’s my favorite color, but those walls are <i>lime-colored</i>. I couldn’t decide if I loved or hated them.  and extricated my belongings from the cart as soon as physically possible. After attempting to wipe it up a bit, I quickly deposited it at the front desk and walked away with relief.  I had hoped that I wouldn’t have to deal with the moving carts for a while (if only because they were  gross ), but I was soon re-acquainted with them during my move to
 
my permanent room in 3East. ⁠ 05 For context, Next House freshmen room assignment is a full-blown saga. First, you’re given a temporary room in an arbitrary wing in Next. You’re allotted one week to wander around and figure out what wing you like (or if you want to First Year Resident Exhange (FYRE) out of Next) and find a roommate(s). After that, every freshman is given a lottery number, and then the games begin; the lottery for the perfect room is long and messy and occurs late at night and also involves a lot of yelling. I got chewed out (and was really sad about it) during at my freshman lottery, but that’s a story for another time.  This time, though, my triple-mates and I started to exploit the mischief-making possibilities of the various wheeled moving apparatus of Next House. Jen sat down on a
 
tiny wheeled platform ⁠ 06 You know those scooter boards in kindergarten? It was exactly like that, minus the primary colors.  and we tied our Orientation Lanyards together into a makeshift rope; regrettably, it wasn’t the most effective method of transit, but it was fun! This sort of shenanigans has become a strangely consistent bit; just last week, I pushed my friend Satya around on a similar board. Eventually, he started saying ‘mush!’ to me like a sled dog, at which point
 
I threatened to push him and his board down the stairs. ⁠ 07 I did not. It was only, like, mildly tempting. Anyways, the point of all of this is to give you some background on the
 
mythical Next House moving carts, ⁠ 08 To be clear, literally nobody but me would refer to these as mythical. They should, though.  because I have a story! The other day, I wandered out of my friend Alison’s room. I was
 
intending to go to sleep, ⁠ 09 It was 12:30, which was already past my bedtime.  but I ran into Ayyub, who, for undisclosed reasons, was currently in possession of one (1) bright blue moving cart. He asked, in an
 
extremely innocent voice, ⁠ 10 Anybody who knows Ayyub will tell you that my first mistake was being this unsuspecting.  if I’d like a
 
ride to my room. ⁠ 11 APPARENTLY he didn’t actually say “to your room”. He says “the room was completely inferred”  I agreed, laughing a little, and
 
hopped into the cart. ⁠ 12 OK, ‘hopped’ is a very generous term. I’m a couple of inches too short for this to go smoothly, so I sort of got one leg over by jumping, and then, like, stumbled in. It wasn’t very graceful.  My room is
 
maybe 40 feet away ⁠ 13 Um. Just being fully transparent here, I have no conception of the size of a foot. It was on this order of magnitude, probably, but my confidence interval is embarrassingly large. The important point is that it was at most a short stroll away. , but Ayyub stalled in 3E Main Lounge on the way. I popped my head out like a nursery rhyme weasel, saying
 
‘Hi!’ ⁠ 14 Saying ‘Hi!’ is my favorite thing ever. Find me and introduce yourself; you’ll understand.  When Ayyub proclaimed that human trafficking seemed like a lucrative business model, I grew concerned about when I’d actually be able to get to sleep. To be clear, I’m like, 98.3% sure that he was just talking about moving people around without their consent. Wait.  … At least he wasn’t charging me.  Somewhat surprisingly, there were only 5 people in 3E ML at this hour, and all of them were busy PSETting, so Ayyub rolled me away pretty quickly. As I had predicted, he sped right past my room. Ayyub sighed deeply when I asked why he hadn’t stopped. “You really should’ve been able to predict this, Shorna.” I buckled down and got ready for a long ride. Knowing Ayyub, I figured I was in for quite the adventure, and I wasn’t disappointed. So, I present to you the places I visited on my not-so-official tour of Next House, in
 
(I think?) ⁠ 15 Ok like, IMO the likelihood that it’s the same cart isn’t insignificant, but I <i>might </i>just be saying that because I think it sounds cool. 
first encountered over a year ago: ⁠ 16 Damn. I really decided to sit in that thing. I was really sleepy when I did this, but still. 3W ML: Ayyub – the heathen – decided that the first, best thing to do was barrel into enemy territory at top speed. In Next House, floors are split into East and West wings; the West wings are smaller
 
and suck. ⁠ 17 This is a joke, 3W is great. They have a gigantic Baymax and a functioning sink, which is more than 3E can say.  I popped up and came face-to-face with
 
my old roommate Athena and also Quinn. ⁠ 18 Huge fan of both of their work  I talked to them for a few minutes about the random CDs 3W had acquired during this past year’s
 
wing storage fiasco, ⁠ 19 It was tragic. Murder mystery material. I’ll tell you about it later. but Ayyub started rolling me away unexpectedly, apparently deciding it was time to keep moving. I shouted goodbye while Ayyub navigated to the elevators. I asked if he would consider taking me back to my room this time. Ayyub just started spinning me around repeatedly to keep me ‘disoriented’ . I laughed at him. 5W ML: Ayyub wheeled me into the elevator and randomly chose a floor. We were going up to the 5th floor, a strange, far-off land that I rarely venture into. I hear the freshmen bite up there. Ayyub is the 5W Resident Peer Mentor, but I bet that he wouldn’t know the people in 5W ML (he lives in 2W) . Unfortunately for me, Ayyub is good at his job, and we rolled into three freshmen he was already well-acquainted with. I speed-introduced myself, but, as a result of Ayyub’s flightiness, we were soon off to the races again. 5E ML: Next up was 5E, known for its fire karaoke events. 5E ML also has this
 
baller ⁠ 20 Oops. I have been forbidden from using this word by Alison. Sorry!  neon sign with the wing name on it. There were a few upperclassmen hanging out and playing Smash, who were also the only ones that seemed even mildly bewildered by my appearing act
 
(and for that, I am eternally grateful). ⁠ 21 I was really hoping for a couple more surprised pikachu faces. 
we walked away, ⁠ 22 Read: Ayyub walked away and I.. just sort of sat there.  Ayyub began pontificating about the ‘sort of people’ that,  metaphorically, ‘ push the carts’ and ‘get pushed in the carts’. He’s not great at metaphors, I think. TFL: This was the last stop on our tour! The TFL (Tastefully Furnished Lounge) is the giant gathering space on the first floor of Next House. All of the Next House student groups use this space – Next Sing has its rehearsals here, Next Act uses it for shows at the end of the semester, and Next Anime uses the TV for showings. Ayyub knew that I probably wouldn’t be in the cart for much longer, so he took the opportunity to show off some maneuvers; there was a lot of spinning and many sudden turns as he wheeled me down the TFL ramp. This was probably the most fun part of the ride, although Ayyub’s purposefully maniacal laughter was admittedly a  little  hard to stomach.  Once I finally rolled to a stop, I struggled out of the cart and we walked back to my room. I got into bed at 2 AM. I was admittedly sleepy during my morning lectures the following day, but I think it was well worth it. Don’t tell Ayyub, though.

A few weeks ago, I visited a friend at Harvard. She snuck me into the observatory. There were murals on the walls in a manner that distinctly reminded me of East Campus, and when she turned on the red lights I noticed the zodiac signs lining the circular room. “What’s your sign?” I asked her. “Guess,” she said. She’s the kind of person who exudes bright optimism and takes any shift in the winds of conversation in stride. Funnily enough, she also really likes penguins, and she’s very similar to another person I know who really likes penguins (enough that she joined a sorority because  their mascot I don’t really remember what I guessed, but it turns out she’s a Gemini. “I’m a Gemini sun, Sagittarius moon, Gemini rising,” she said. That checked out. One of my closest friends, August, is a Gemini, and the similarities clicked in my brain. Chatty, first and foremost, but in an incredibly charming way. Enthusiastic, social, and a little dreamy and elusive. “Okay, guess my sign,” I said. “Something water, definitely…Scorpio?” “God, I   I were a Scorpio. I love Scorpios.” I mean it. Some of my closest friends have been Scorpios. Something about their intensity just draws me in. “But no, I’m a Pisces.” “Oh, you’re a Pisces? That explains why you have so many Spotify playlists.” We left the observatory shortly after because it was really hot and they’d turned off the air conditioning for some reason and we were wiping the sweat off our foreheads between every sentence and it was also daytime so there was nothing to observe, but I couldn’t stop thinking about what she said, because she read me to filth. Spotify and I have a complicated relationship. But it’s true: I   have a lot of Spotify playlists. Spotify holds such a place in my heart that I’ve said it’s  one of my ultimate love languages And for some reason, almost everyone I know who takes Spotify as seriously as I do also has Pisces placements. When I was visiting Seattle last month, making dinner at my friend Alex’s house, August (who has a Pisces moon) and I were flitting around Alex’s boyfriend and their roommate like little fairies, taking their phones to make them follow our Spotify accounts. Our cardinal rule of Spotify is that we never follow anyone first. We make them follow us and then follow them back so we’re never caught participating in unreciprocated following. Fan behavior. The thought appalls us. I recently also discovered that Sidney Gish, one of my favorite artists of all time, shares my exact birthday — just five years older. This makes her a Pisces, and when I was scrolling through her  artist profile As of writing this, I’ve got 2,024 liked songs on Spotify, collecting each one carefully like rocks on the beach, testing the weight of them in my hands and the emotions they spur in me. For this post, I thought I’d put my liked songs on shuffle five times and do a little annotation of what comes up and what it means to me, kind of like those old  Tumblr ask games Also,  follow my Spotify 
:-) ⁠ 01 fun fact: apparently they invented this emoticon at carnegie mellon on september 19, 1982, and every year they put posters up about it august was telling me about how they got a $1 shirt from the guy and some smiley cookies?!! which is the cutest thing ever Okay, let’s go. Last spring, my friend Luca posted on her story asking if anyone was going to the Magdalena Bay concert. I’d seen them a few times on some of August’s playlists, but I’d never actually listened to their music before.I told Luca I’d go to the concert, but then I didn’t end up going because I forgot to buy tickets and by the time I checked they’d all sold out…only after that did I take a look at their Spotify profile and their latest album, Mercurial World. “Secrets (Your Fire)” is one of the first songs I listened to, along with “Hysterical Us,” and after that I was hooked. They have such a dreamy, trippy, synthy sound that really makes my brain sparkle — a good band to study to. Magdalena Bay was actually one of the first things Chris and I talked about. I introduced her to a few songs and we’ve had a few nights where we just listen to the whole Mercurial World album together. We’re seeing them in November, which is super exciting! They also released their  deluxe version of Mercurial World When I was a freshman in high school, there was a senior named Emily that I really looked up to. She had her own band. It was a sort of punk rock riot girl type vibe, and I remember at some sort of talent show I watched her jamming on her guitar, a head of bleached platinum blonde hair bobbing up and down, fingers flying over the strings. She was   cool. We were in the spring musical, Guys and Dolls, together. I was an extra: my job was to act like a tourist and run around the stage during Runyonland, the opening song. She was Nicely-Nicely Johnson, one of the main roles. I had a lot of free time during rehearsals and I used it to draw or just generally fuck around on the internet. I don’t quite remember how, but I stumbled upon her blog one day, and that’s where I found out that she was friends with the members of Hippo Campus back when they were all in middle school. The band members went to a performing arts high school in the Twin Cities, and my high school was in St. Paul, so it checked out. I didn’t really listen to their music until this song came up on my Discover Weekly one day in 2019 and I was reminded of Emily. I first discovered Conan Gray in 2018 when one of his music videos came up on my YouTube home page. He looked like one of my friends who had graduated last year, which is why he caught my attention, and it was just a really good song. I fell in love with his other songs about feeling stuck in his small town and  his hopes Conan Gray is one of those artists where I know their entire discography by heart. I went to his concert in March, a day before my birthday, which was funny because it was actually someone’s birthday and he sang them happy birthday. Seeing him and singing along to all of his songs and relating to every word was a cathartic experience. I was a total crying wreck by the end of the concert. Previous Next I found this song around the time when I was going through a lot emotionally during my sophomore spring. I felt a little hopeless and very lost, like I’d never find my way out of  all the holes I had dug myself into It also felt very relevant to my experiences at MIT. I have met so many incredible people here, with brains that function in ways that I can barely comprehend, but unhealthy coping mechanisms abound at the same time. It comes with the territory of such a high-stress environment, I guess — and I’ve fallen into those same traps. And very much like the song, I visited New York over spring break last semester to see Mitski at Radio City with some friends. That didn’t end up happening, because someone on her team got COVID and the concert got canceled. But I did have a good time visiting Jeff and going to Flushing with them to try all the delicious food there. Seeing the differences between their experiences at Columbia and mine at MIT was really interesting — and it was good to get a new perspective on certain things. As an upperclassman this year — which is so messed up, honestly, when did I get this   — I can’t help but feel like I’m a little jaded. Being around frosh helps, but at the same time, three weeks into the semester, the secondhand frosh energy is starting to wear off. Near Tears is right: I   want to be jaded. The first Maude Latour song I listened to was “ Superfruit Well, not really. But Maude is one of my favorite artists, ever. She went to Columbia and a lot of her songs really encapsulate a lot of what it’s like to be a college student, all the drama of relationships and finding yourself and spending time with friends out in the sun. I’ve been honored to see her grow in the past few years. I’m actually seeing her at a concert next Thursday! I have a signed poster by her, too — August goes to Carnegie Mellon and Maude sang at an event, and now it’s hanging on my wall. I can’t wait to see her sing in person. She has such an incredible presence. Here’s a short little playlist that contains these songs, plus a few more of my other favorite songs ever! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do <3

Today’s an MIT student holiday! Years ago the faculty decided that students don’t have enough holidays, so they added some to the academic calendar, to guarantee each month has at least one three-day weekend. On most years, we get two student holidays in the fall, in accordance to  Rules and Regulations of the Faculty 2.11 Classes shall be suspended during the following additional vacation periods: — A Friday in September on or after the 15th (except when Labor Day is September 6th or 7th) to be determined annually by the Registrar in consultation with the Chair of the Faculty[…] — Day following Indigenous Peoples Day (except when Labor Day is September 1st, 6th, or 7th)[…] Not only was there no class today, but lots of things were going on around MIT. For example, today the MIT Museum had an  MIT Community Day Muriel Cooper-esque Some of the sights around the Museum included Tim the Beaver beholding  an ancient version of himself The huge Brass Rat from the  Cannon hack Interview transcripts, photos from the Creative Photography Lab, a “write a poem with GPT-3” booth with a nice mechanical keyboard… Previous Next Classrooms. Large speakers that played a recording when you stood on a circle in front of them. Snacks. An art piece made from lots and lots of shirts. Previous Next As you may know from my posts about  course catalogs Campus Preview Weekend “Tech is Hell” graphic identity my dorm room  to come back later to see more. (It’s also pushing me to finish my blog post drafts…) I head out of the Museum and go past Lobby 7, where new banners were being put up along the columns. These were the new values in  the Values Statement doors that aren’t open Along the walkway across the Small Dome was a thrift pop-up for used women’s clothing. On Kresge Lawn, under a tarp, the  Great Glass Pumpkin Patch excellent post about it Past that, in Johnson Rink, was the  Fall Career Fair I also missed in-person career fairs because of the swag. If you’ve read  any previous post about career fair So yeah! Today was exhausting but fun. If you can,  check out the MIT Museum

Recently, my friend rejected several people who were interested in him. This friend is single and would like to have a girlfriend, and these women had no obvious dealbreakers that I knew of, so I asked him why he’d rejected all of them. “I really can’t say,” was his reply. “It’s like, they were inputted into the neural network of my brain and the response was  No .” Obviously, I don’t know for sure if this is the true answer. It’s possible there was some more specific reason that he didn’t want to admit. After all, these decisions can be very personal, and the real answer could have been unflattering or cruel to those women. But I’ve also known this friend to be pretty honest with me, and in the past, he has given me detailed answers on why he dumped previous girlfriends. When he told me he didn’t know why he’d rejected these women, I was surprised, simply because it’s not how I operate. I’ll confess that I spend a lot of time inside my own head: I always want to know  why  I’m choosing to do something. This doesn’t mean that the reason is always meaningful. For example, I would probably reject anyone who asked me out if they shared a name with my brother (this scenario hasn’t happened yet; like me, my brother has an uncommon name), and that’s not exactly a deep or fair reason for rejecting someone. But it would just be way too awkward to date someone who was also named Kyler. This also doesn’t mean that the reason needs to be disclosed to the other party. I’ve rejected plenty of people for reasons that might be hurtful to them; there was someone who spent our entire first (and only) date talking about himself, but it would’ve been rude for me to inform him that’s why I didn’t want to see him again, especially since he didn’t ask for that feedback. Of course, my desire for self-knowledge extends to domains besides romance. In fact, it permeates most everything I do. Taking an example from when I was younger, in the aftermath of the 2015 Paris terror attacks, Facebook introduced a profile filter of the French national flag. Users could apply it to their profile photo to show solidarity with those affected. Soon, my entire feed was awash with stripes of blue, white, and red. I considered using it too, but I couldn’t justify the reasoning to myself. What difference would it make to the civilians of Paris if a high school student from Portland changed her profile photo on social media? Was there any real purpose to doing this besides signaling to my peers that I cared, too? (And that’s not even to say that signaling is inherently wrong. In this situation, signaling seems mostly harmless; at most, it might distract from more meaningful actions towards making change, but I don’t know if there is much else I could’ve contributed anyway.) If I did apply this filter, would I be doing so to attain social approval, while telling myself that this was a magnanimous act? Intuitively, I find self-deception appalling. To delude myself about why I do something feels like sleepwalking through life. It’s pretty unfortunate that shame and self-castigation prevent self-awareness. Returning to the aforementioned Facebook profile filter, I don’t believe that applying the filter just to socially signal is wrong. We signal all the time! When I affix a pink, purple, and blue sticker to my laptop, I am signaling that I am bisexual. When I state that I am a computer science and mathematics double-major on my resumé, I am signaling that I am skilled and technically competent. But those signals are widely accepted. Signaling moral virtue, however, is a contradiction: you’re selfishly claiming to be selfless. This contradiction is met with derision (“virtue-signaling” is a common insult applied to those posting about social justice issues), which has never encouraged anyone to become more genuine in their intentions but instead prevents people from being honest with themselves about their motivations. Truthfully, I am a jumble of contradictions. Like, back in high school, I believed that the college admissions rat race was elitist and shallow, but also I grinded for top grades and a high SAT score and impressive extracurriculars. Sure, I enjoyed the process of attaining those achievements, but I doubt I would’ve invested all that effort and time if I hadn’t wanted to attend a great university. For example, I took an extra biology class marked as “IB”, meaning it was advanced and could boost my GPA, instead of enrolling in a fine arts or culinary course I would’ve preferred had I been optimizing simply for personal passions. I don’t feel the need to lie to myself by claiming this was out of genuine interest in the subject matter; I still don’t enjoy biology that much. Nor do I want to pretend that this motive was somehow charitable, that by attending a more prestigious school I might be able to help more people in the world or something. When I was sixteen years old, while some part of me did care about making a difference and uplifting others, a large part of me also wanted the approval of my peers and parents by getting into a school like MIT. So even though I intellectually understood that the game I was playing was bullshit, I still wanted to win the game. (Another argument: despite the game itself being bullshit, the rewards of the game are  not  bullshit, especially if you otherwise lack the resources to forge a strong professional network or find great early-career opportunities.) To be honest towards myself, I have to admit this misalignment between my choices and my professed values. To be able to admit the misalignment, I have to greet myself with kindness, to create a safe environment at least within myself so I don’t need to hide. In  Mockingjay  by Suzanne Collins, there is a moment where the narrator, Katniss, says: “It takes a long time before I get to the bottom of why I’m so upset. When I do, it’s almost too mortifying to admit. All those months of taking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful are over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am. Violent. Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly. And I hate him for it.” It’s been years since I’ve read the  Hunger Games  trilogy, yet that passage has never left me. Why is it so difficult for us to see ourselves as we are? How can we know our true selves when we have created a facade to protect ourselves? Online articles on self-love have told me to accept the acne scars on my forehead, the low quiz score on my physics exam, the waddle in my gait. All of that is easy to love. It’s everything else that is hard. In this blog post, I haven’t made much of a case for  why  self-knowledge is important, and I’m not sure I believe that everybody should analyze themselves to hell and back about why they do everything they do. My friend rejected that woman and he doesn’t know why; sure, maybe if he introspected some more, he would learn something new about himself, or be able to achieve some new echelon of romantic success, but I don’t have any evidence that the result would be net positive, that this effort would be worth it.  All I can say is that I’ve always been searching for myself, and I find it unbearable when I can’t articulate my own inner cause and effect. If I’m not aware of the forces driving me, what agency do I truly hold? That isn’t to say there are no downsides to this philosophy. As I’ve mentioned earlier, I spend a lot of time in my own head, but life is meant to be experienced, not only scrutinized from a distance. For example, last fall, I was struggling to complete an assignment in a timely manner. “I should reflect on why I feel this urge to procrastinate,” I told my then-boyfriend. “No, you should just ignore that and do the work,” he said. And he was correct. When a house is on a fire, it is more important to douse the flames than to investigate their cause. Still, I cannot resist the fundamental questions:  why am I doing this? Why do I feel this way? Why am I the way I am?  I suspect I’ll spend the rest of my life looking for the answers.

Warning: this blog features spoilers for the video game  Celeste  regarding the plot. I highly encourage you to play the game if you haven’t, it’s one of my favorite platformers. But there are spoilers. So. If that really bothers you, go download the game, play it through, and this blog will be waiting for you when you’re done. You have been warned. (I will also clearly note where spoilers begin and where they end.) 1. Voices In My Head 
Song: ⁠ 01 Right now I plan to keep finding music to go with my posts until I deem it cringe Voices in my Head : imposter syndrome exists. If you don’t experience imposter syndrome: I am glad, because it is more painful and hollowing than nearly any PSET or bad relationship that I’ve ever gone through. If you do: I’m so sorry I know what that feels like, and
 
you are not alone. ⁠ 02 and if you believe otherwise that is just the imposter syndrome talking Imposter syndrome: always there, always grinning, ominously. (original comic by Shen Comix) My experience with imposter syndrome has been a somewhat interesting one. For me, imposter syndrome just sort of, exists. It’s a voice in the back of my head reminding me how behind I am, or how ahead others are, especially when it comes to math. To some extent, I’ve learned how to quiet this voice: I just cover it up with the confidence of facts. : I am on track to graduate, and so, in two years, I should have a degree in mathematics from MIT.  : There are plenty of people who are “ahead” of me in math, whatever that means, but I still enjoy doing math and that’s what matters.  : Learning is a process, not a competition, and I’m excited to be going through it. Typing this out, these facts almost feel like Stockholm syndrome. I’ve just sort of,  grown  around this pest I can’t get rid of. Sometimes, I wish I could get rid of the voice. That it didn’t just linger in the background, poking and prodding at my insecurities. But I also don’t know who I would be without it. Isn’t that terrifying? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, after I attended the first  Women in Math  lunch seminar of the semester last Friday (9/16). This
 
seminar/informal conversation ⁠ 03 with free food, always a plus Jinyoung Park , a Szegö Assistant Professor from Stanford. At one point during the interview, she was talking about imposter syndrome in a way that I related to quite a bit: she personified imposter syndrome as a Part of Her. She (roughly) said: “I don’t want this Part of Me to stop me. I don’t want this Part of Me to win. This is very different from how I visualized my imposter syndrome. Sure, I don’t want this
 
Voice in my head ⁠ 04 which is frankly quite irrational albeit persuasive  to win similar to Park, but the way she described her experiences with imposter syndrome personified it. Made it human. Made it,  competitive . And if there’s one thing I’ve learned a bit of while at MIT, it’s how to deal with a competitive spirit. 2. Part of Me Song:  Resurrections After first hearing the depiction of imposter syndrome as “Part of Me”, my mind went to the video game  Celeste . This
 
game ⁠ 05 that I spent way too much time playing my freshman year There is a lot to say about the  gameplay, music, and plot (all of which you can read about in CJ’s amazing post on  Celeste Plot spoilers begin here. One of the most interesting parts of the game, in my opinion, is its lack of bad guys that platformers usually have. The Bowser in the Mario franchise, and the Hollow Knight in,, well,
 
Hollow Knight. ⁠ 06 another amazing game go play it and come back /half joking But in Celeste, it’s just Madeline, the mountain, the various whimsical characters she meets along the way, and oh yeah, her anxiety . Badeline, aka “Part of Me”, is a personified version of Madeline’s anxiety and depression. In early parts of the game Madeline is driven further along by Badeline in an epic chase scene, while later on we see Madeline confronting and challenging her reflection. But it is only when they agree to coexist as both  true  and  valid  parts of Madeline that Madeline becomes
 
stronger ⁠ 07 mechanically and emotionally Spoilers vaguely end here. So, where does that leave me? Confused. To some extent. I mean,  Celeste , like Park’s depiction of her imposter syndrome, is yet another clear case of personifying insecurities so that one can battle them and hopefully make it out the other side.  And this personification is clearly helpful! I mean, I had been picturing my imposter syndrome as something in my head and that was  unhelpful . It was frustrating feeling like my biggest battles were just in my head, and it isn’t as though personifying them changes the fact that they are internal feelings, but it does? Doesn’t it? Personifying imposter syndrome turns insecurities into “some asshole whose opinion I couldn’t care less about anyways.” And I  un fortunately get the opportunity to deal with people with opinions like those all the time. So personification is a helpful way to think about various parts of myself, but for some reason this still feels unsatisfying, because in the end Madeline, like Jinyoung and myself with imposter syndrome, learn to coexist, but this doesn’t always feel possible. 3. Parts of Me Song:  Past Life , by Jules Paymer There are a lot of parts to me. Some of the largest parts are ones that require the least amount of worrying because they’re so  grounded  in facts.  Like the fact that I’m trans. You might think that this fact would play a large role in my life, which to some extent is true, but mentally it’s rather light. Facts sort of work that way; they simply  are . So while I spend time thinking about trans-related topics, it doesn’t weigh on my mind. At one point it used to, but it doesn’t anymore. This is like Badeline. Badeline learned to coexist with Madeline, and Madeline with Badeline. Both characters have their own innate faults, but they can both merge to form a stronger collective. But there are parts of me, the smaller, less identity-intense parts, that feel so much heavier. They feel like a pebble with the mass of the sun, begging to be picked up but at such a large potential cost. Maybe this would be more clear if I stopped being so vague. Some parts of me: I like math. I like education. I like to write. For the sake of this blog I’ll just focus on these three. I have loved these three parts of me for as long as I can remember. And that has been great while I’ve been in school because all three of these parts can continue to coexist as I take math courses, teach classes, and write blogs. But around the corner, slowly but surely, is the year 2024. The year that I graduate from MIT. What happens then? Well, I hope, I will get to more closely pursue any of these aspects of myself that I have come to love. I can get a PhD in math and teach classes for the rest of my life to fulfill the first two parts. Or travel the world writing expository pieces on education and communication. Or I could try my hand at writing math textbooks or a math blog. I don’t know. But whichever way I choose to go, I feel like I am letting some part of myself down. I can try to continue pursuing all of these options equally but that doesn’t  seem  smart.  That  would lead to one of two cases as far as I can tell: 1) I become just ~eh~ in each of these parts or
 
2) ⁠ 08 more likely I can visualize these parts of myself distinctly. It’s like, there’s one with chalk in her hair, one with a pen tucked behind her ear, and another clichely
 
eating an apple. ⁠ 09 because I ran out of ways to personify these parts parts of me . They’re tangible. Their dreams are my own. I worry that any one of these parts can’t thrive without diminishing the others, but I also  know  that realistically I can’t grow if I don’t make any choices about what I want to do. So what do I do? I don’t know. But writing this out, I think I found a somewhat common link. 4. Spontaneity Song:  Soldier, Poet, King  by The Oh Hellos : I believe that I will one day be truly happy doing *something* related to math, education, or writing, and I know that I won’t be happy in the long run if I try to do it all.  : I don’t need to know what that *something* is yet. These facts are ones that are based on feelings and intuition, but as of right now, this is as close to true as I can make the statement. I don’t truly  know  that I would find true happiness that way, I just  know  that I have felt happiest when committing to my hobbies intensely and intentionally. I mean that’s how I got here *gestures vaguely*. What frustrates me most, is that if I chose one of these Parts to chase after, I think I could make
 
their ⁠ 10 i.e. the Part’s go  for it. I wish I was spontaneous. I don’t think I am a very spontaneous person. I try to sit with my thoughts and ensure that I’m not acting too irrationally. And yet, the most  amazing things  can happen at the drop of a hat. I can fly to a state I’ve never been to before and live there my freshman fall (another story for another time), and I can decide to teach a class (yet another story for yet another time). So why is it so hard to just  decide  what I’m going to do with my life? Well, for one thing, maybe it’s because I keep viewing the decision as affecting the rest of my life, as if putting my heart and soul into my work also means literally putting my soul into it. But also, maybe it’s because being spontaneous requires  energy . Energy to put in the work, and the mental/physical energy to be okay with the possibility of failing. I don’t think I have that energy right now. I want to! I really do. Maybe it’s the many cups of coffee running through my veins, or maybe it’s the fact that I have two more years here, but I don’t have that energy right now. I will have the energy eventually I’m sure of it. But right now, my energy has been going into growing at MIT. The past two years I’ve grown into myself quite a bit. I mean, as a concept, “myself” existed before MIT, and a version of “myself” will exist afterwards, but those concepts were defined by my environment more than anything else. Before MIT, I was just a kid who liked school, nothing more, nothing less. Who knows where I’ll be two years from now. Who knows, maybe (hopefully) one day soon I will be ready to go on an epic quest to explore the world outside of MIT. But for now, I’m not quite ready for another adventure. For now, this desire to be spontaneous will have to just remain a part of me. #imposter syndrome #video games

In the process of moving our office from its inaugural location on the Infinite Corridor to its new home in the MIT Welcome Center, I stumbled into some accidental admissions archeology. For nearly a century,  
for as long as there had been an admissions office at MIT, ⁠ 01 <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/mithistory/institute/offices/mit-admissions-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to MIT Libraries</a>, the MIT Admissions Office was formally created in 1929, led by the Institute’s first-ever admissions officer, Dr. James Libby Tryon.</span> MIT Bulletin from 1930 Anyway, let me set the scene: one day in the summer of 2020—at the height of the campus COVID-19 lockdown—I was permitted to visit the office to clear any personal belongings out of my space in 3-001 before the professional movers got to work. Prohibition style, I met a colleague with authorized campus access at an unmarked service door at the basement level of our building; he ushered me in and we exchanged an awkward hello after having not seen each other in months. “Make it quick,” he remarked, as if we were orchestrating some kind of heist—and like a mysterious oracle, he vanished in an instant. It would be another year until I saw him again in person. I didn’t make it quick, after all. After spending a few minutes going through all of my stuff, I spent a good hour rummaging through all our old filing cabinets, taking full advantage of being in the office unsupervised. At the bottom of an old metal filing cabinet, I found a trove of vintage MIT relics, everything from a set of vibrant neon Campus Preview Weekend brochures from the 90s, stacks of old MIT Admissions marketing materials, and even a mysterious
 
VHS tape titled MIT: Mind and Hand. ⁠ 02 Does anyone have a VHS player handy? I’d love to see what’s on this tape. CJ At the very bottom of the cabinet, I found the most exciting discovery of all:  in perfect condition. I had no choice but to assume this copy of the application had been sitting unnoticed at the bottom of this drawer since the 1970s, waiting to be excavated by some admissions officer 50 years later. Since this application would have been completed by students in the 1972–1973 application cycle, I thought it would be appropriate to share it with you all now, a half-century later, as the 2022–2023 application cycle is in full swing. Previous Next Set in modernist International Style/Swiss typography—undoubtedly a product of legendary designers  Cooper and Casey One of my favorite parts of the 1973 application is the letter from the Director of Admissions, Peter Hughes Richardson, that greets the applicant on the first page. Peter Richardson served as Director of Admissions from 1972–1984, and coincidentally led the admissions office when  Stu Schmill We are pleased that the undergraduate educational opportunities at M.IT. have attracted your attention. Our basic approach to the purposes and goals of undergraduate education is characterized by a flexibility and openmindedness that was not evident a few short years ago. Faculty attention and student efforts focus on a style of educational encounter which emphasizes the context of the learning experience—the relationship of teacher and student—as contrasted with the subject matter of that experience. It is clear that no single style of education and no small set of alternative styles is appropriate for our student body with its extraordinary diversity in interests, abilities, preparation, and experience. The primary goal of the faculty is to assist students to arrive at the threshold of educational self-sufficiency and independence. We hope you will decide to join us in this endeavor. The Admissions Office looks forward to receiving your application, and we at M.I.T. look forward to the coming exchange of information as you make plans for your future. Sincerely yours, Peter Richardson 
Director of Admissions Several pages of information about MIT’s academic program and campus life follow the Director’s Letter. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many aspects of contemporary MIT reflected in these pages, including references to the  Hobby Shop Black Students Union January Independent Activity Period MIT Symphony Orchestra The application advertises 33 majors for the Bachelor of Science degree, including a few programs no longer offered (like Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and History, Theory, and Criticism of Visual Arts). Though the number of  undergraduate majors MIT offers has nearly doubled Emphasis on fundamentals and self-reliance are central in M.I.T.’s educational philosophy. A strong sense of the quantitative and the analytical, a critical analysis of the cause and effect, a demand for precision, and a powerful curiosity about things not understood enter every classroom. And even in the 1970s, MIT was making an effort to shine a light on its esteemed programs in the  humanities and social sciences While teaching and research in engineering have been the source of M.I.T.’s reputation, the scope of the Institute has always been broader than its title suggests. Today the increasing interaction of science and its applications with industry and research in the environment, the humanities, economics, psychology, political science, linguistics, the history and philosophy of science, as well as architecture, management, and urban studies are based upon the traditional fields of engineering and science—still the dominant “majors” here. The discussion of the first-year academic program feels largely familiar to the current structure of our current program—with the exception of “pass-fail grading” now taking on a newer form as  P/NR The first-year program commonly contains electives and required subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and humanities. While there are alternative versions of each of the required subjects, they provide appropriate preparation for all the fields of undergraduate study. Pass-fail grading is used in the freshman year. Previous Next Before the application itself, the booklet provides some general information about the “application procedure,” including application deadlines,
 
recommended high school coursework, ⁠ 03 “Specifically required for entrance are four years of English, mathematics through trigonometry, physics, and chemistry. The precise form of the mathematics curriculum is not important as long as it will prepare a student to go on directly to calculus. Students who have covered the standard topics before their senior year probably should continue by taking either calculus or other more advanced topics in mathematics that may be offered by their school.” interview In addition to the SAT, MIT required three Achievement Tests (ACH), renamed SAT II: Subject Tests in 2005, in three categories: math, science, and social sciences/humanities: M.I.T. requires every applicant to take the College Board (C.E.E.B.) tests; the Scholastic Aptitude Test and three Achievement Tests in: 1. Level I or Level II Mathematics, 2. Physics or Chemistry, 3. English Composition or American History and Social Studies or European History and World Cultures. The tests may be taken at any time and any number of times but should be completed not later than January of the senior year. Though it is now widely known that we release our Regular Action admissions decisions on Pi Day (March 14), that convention—now something of an MIT tradition—didn’t arise  until the 2000s wasn’t even a guaranteed date The Admissions Committee completes the selection of the freshman class early in the spring and most candidates are informed of the decision on their applications in early April. The 1973 application provides separate instructions for Early Action applicants (they used the same November 1 deadline back then, and also followed a non-binding process), though it seems that the majority of applicants followed the standard timeline that we now call Regular Action. Students who have taken all of the required tests before their senior year have returned all of the application material by November 1, and have made a request in writing will have their applications reviewed by December 1. If their qualifications are so excellent that they are clearly acceptable, an offer of admission will be made. Other applications will be held without prejudice for consideration at the usual time in the spring. A student admitted under this plan is not required to reply to the offer of admission until May 1, the Candidates reply Date. Other parts of the process have remained unchanged: similar to contemporary policy, students were required to reply to their offer of admission by early May, and students admitted through Early Action are not required (or “bound”) to attend MIT. While today I would tell applicants “There’s no need to apply early and rush your application—apply when you are ready. Just do not wait until the last minute!” the instructions in the 1973 application are a bit more direct.  To remove application forms, open staples at center fold, remove pages 7-22, then reclose staples. The Application for Admission from Secondary School and the Secondary School Report are 4-page forms. You should separate the Teacher Evaluations and the Financial Aid Application. Also separate the College Board Test Information Card from the two-part Referral Card. Complete your application early and avoid the rush. 1. Return the enclosed referral card at once, if you have not already received instructions about your interview. We will send you the name of a member of the M.I.T. Educational Council with whom you should arrange your conference. 2. Send directly to the Office of Admissions the FINAL APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION together with the $15 APPLICATION FEE made payable to “M.I.T.” Include the CEEB INFORMATION CARD with your Final Application. 3. The required SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE (SAT) AND ACHIEVEMENT TESTS (ACH) should betaken no later than the January 1973 testing date. Foreign students see special instructions on page 27. 4. Give the SECONDARY SCHOOL REPORT FORM to your high school Guidance Counselor. Your counselor will return it directly to M.I.T. 5. Ask two of your teachers to fill out the EVALUATION OF APPLICANT BY TEACHER forms to be returned directly to M.I.T. We suggest you place a stamp on each form. 6. Give the other EVALUATION OF APPLICANT form to a third person. This person should be someone who has worked with you outside of the classroom (perhaps as well as inside the classroom). Again a stamp is sure to be appreciated. 7. If you think you may need financial aid:a) Fill out the APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID and send it directly to the Student Financial Aid Office (M.I.T. Room 5-119) by January 10. You need not apply for aid from specific funds, such as the National Defense Loan Fund. Your aid application will not affect your application for admission; decisions are made by separate committees.b) U.S. and Canadian citizens must submit the PARENTS’ CONFIDENTIAL STATEMENT(PCS) to the College Scholarship Service with the required fee by January 10. Citizens of other countries need not file a PCS. 8. An applicant for EARLY ACTION must have completed all the requirements by November 1, 1972. The applicant must request Early Action in writing when submitting the Final Application. Aside from the application form needing to be typewritten or written in ink, the applicant form from the 70s feels largely consistent with our current application. Just as we do now, the 1973 application asks for a student’s “principal recent school and community activities and individual pursuits including participation in such areas a student government, athletics, music, religions and social work, and projects or hobbies.” Students are also asked to share jobs they’ve held, and information about how they’ve spent their summers. (I appreciate the snarky instructions that state, “Be reasonably specific on the allocation of time.”) Perhaps the most radical difference I noticed were in some of the “short answer” questions, some that do not have directly analogues on our current application. 16. Comment on a book that has affected your point of view, or some topic that you have read into extensively, apart from your school work. I love how prompt 16 directs the student to engage in meaningful self-reflection, leading the student to discuss a topic they have explored   This prompt sends a clear message that MIT is interested in identifying students who cultivate intellectual interests on their own time—not only when they are required to. While this is still something we value at MIT, we don’t currently have a section of the application that explicitly solicits this information. 17. List in order of preference the fields of study you are most seriously considering: Prompt 17 is the only question that lives on in similar format on the current application. Today, we ask students to select an area of study at MIT that interests them from a drop-down menu of programs at MIT, and then in 100 words we ask them to elaborate on their interest. 18. In a paragraph or two discuss one of your interests that you would like to develop over the next four years. Prompt 18 takes a more open-ended approach to a student’s long-term interests in a format that our current application doesn’t quite capture. In today’s application, students often end up inadvertently sharing their long-term goals and interests—whether in a short answer response, in an optional portfolio, or elsewhere—but prompt 18 intentionally invites students to share how their goals intersect with MIT in the longer-term, past the point of admission. Previous Next  (with periods between each letter). These days, we tend to write the acronym without punctuation, simply  . I suspect it was in the 90s,  with the advent of the sans serif graphic identity . Who knew that document-based questions (DBQs) from AP World History would one day come in handy? Poring over this 30-page application opened up so many rabbit holes about MIT history that this post has barely scratched the surface of. At this point, I am left grappling with the paradoxical sense that 1972 feels somehow unfathomably distant and incredibly close to 2022. While much about MIT’s admissions process, the larger landscape of college admissions, and the composition of the MIT student body has changed, it is fascinating that our fundamental approach to both sharing information about this place and identifying its future members has remained the same. I wonder what the next 50 years will bring for MIT and our admissions office. What essay questions will we be asking, if any at all? Is the future dean of admissions a current undergraduate student right now? Will a researcher at MIT CSAIL design an artificially intelligent system that will render my job obsolete? Or will an admissions officer 50 years from now stumble this blog saved on an old hard drive somewhere in the MIT Welcome Center and laugh? #1970s #college applications #MIT Admissions history #MIT history

32-123 ⁠ 01 One of the big lecture halls in the Stata Center When I joined MITWE at the start of my freshman fall, we were still amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we needed proper PPE, which included high-tech music accessories such as… facemasks draping over our mouthpieces and trash bags covering all other holes in our instruments. Spot the clarinet. (I’m using a drawstring bag here, but I had to use a literal trash bag with an elastic band for the first few rehearsals) Not the most exciting things in the world. Especially when you have to turn pages while wearing them; luckily, the bags did not stick around for long. It had been more than a year since MITWE rehearsed in person as a group, so we were still figuring things out and trying to make rehearsals more streamlined. The pandemic had disrupted so many existing processes, but one good outcome was the rise of digital classroom technologies. The newfound prevalence of loaner iPads across the MIT campus must have given Dr Fred Harris (MITWE director) a brilliant idea because, during the first rehearsal of the new semester, he made an exciting announcement: “We are going paperless, starting next week!” MITWE was well-established as my favourite MIT class then, so this was just the cherry on top. I could hear hushed whispers amongst the ensemble as I imagined life without having to carry around hard copies of music anymore. Gone are the days of papercuts, misaligned photocopies, and dropping a stack of paper in the middle of a performance. Eco-friendly   a renewable source of HASS-A credits – talk about sustainability! The music department in a nutshell “But Andi!” I hear you cry, “How could you read sheet music off your tiny loaner iPad?” That’s where Fred comes in. Somehow, he pulled enough strings (pun intended, but not really because we are a wind ensemble) to convince IS&T to loan out 12.9-inch iPad pros to everyone in MITWE and the Festival Jazz Ensemble! That’s right – the ones with face ID, magnetic Apple pencils, and USB-C charging. Admittedly, this may seem overkill for reading and annotating music, but hey, I’m not complaining. What my friends imagine when they first hear about my upgrade And to top it all off, we also got Bluetooth foot pedals to automate page-turning. I tried one out on Monday, and it just worked like magic. I felt simultaneously like a child discovering the joys of a computer and a professional musician performing in Carnegie Hall. Truly life-changing. W O A H I could go on and on, but words alone cannot describe how powerful Fred is. But numbers can –

It’s been— —two weeks since I last posted, which is a week’s gap longer than usual. Oops! As part of 21W.765 Interactive Narrative, we were assigned to read Raymond Queneau’s classic  . In it are 99 retellings of the same story, each written in a different style, ranging from “Hesitation” to “Tactile” to “Spoonerisms”. We discussed, in class, our favorite and least favorite styles. Then we were assigned to narrate a short story of our own, in both our favorite   least favorite styles. I decided to narrate a scene from last Saturday night. I had a lot of fun with this exercise and decided to write not just twice, but ten times: my top five and my bottom five. Can you guess which is which? On a certain date, I carried a crate with a lot of weight, and on a cart it did skate. It was late, three hours past eight, and it began to precipitate. With straight gait, I accelerate to an undergraduate congregate. Through an ornate gate, the cart I did elevate and escalate. The journey to migrate this crate did culminate, to where it did originate, the office appropriate for the guild assassinate. Aftrate a short wait, I escate the officiate, and entrate a room alternate. I notate three friendates, talkate about a partate, and ate some popcornate from a mate. In a dim moonless night, a fish made its way upstream, as it nursed a school of smaller fish. They swam, avoiding predators and nets, intent on approaching a desination. They swam past a rock and some grass, before diving into a deep trench. The bigger fish greeted the family of the school of smaller fish, and left the smaller fish before swimming away. Later, I saw the bigger fish looking at the surface of the ocean, as stray bait floated down from the sky. The fish consumed the bait and left. I transported some objects upward, and returned them to where I took them from. Later, I meet some friends and eat food. Tonight you will find yourself pushing a grocery cart filled with Nerf guns down the path known as the Outfinite. Then it will become windier, and you’ll push the cart faster to compensate. On your way to your destination you will pass by many people outside, where on a typical night there would be none. You will then push the cart into an elevator, and return the Nerf guns to the office of the Assassins Guild. A little later, you will exit this office. You will then enter another office, and you will see three of your friends, who were part of the crowd of people you saw on your way. Two friends will leave, and the third will offer you food; you must accept it. I was offered popcorn by a friend, and the two of us were left in the ESP office after two others left. I had just exited the Assassins Guild office, where I had dropped off some Nerf guns. These were carried into the office on a grocery cart, that I had taken up the Student Center elevator. On my way to the Student Center, I saw several people, and before that I was pushing the cart faster, because the wind was blowing so hard. This happened at the Outfinite, at eleven in the evening. I was carrying the cart one night it so happened that I became conscious of the items in the cart which you might say was a premonition or a prophecy of what is to come to me as it just so happens I was and the in the items in my cart were these plastic guns that I or perhaps something else revealed something larger about me I don’t know but I thought you would know. Certainly while the cart was in motion the breeze began to blow and this gathering of people, lots of people you see, I saw them walking around and full of energy I could feel in the air but the gathering was not my cup of tea. What this gathering was for I do not know, well perhaps this is a fib as I do know it was related to a larger event, but I do not know for certain whether this was related to the event or merely incident to it, and I, well, fair enough, I mean to say, the people were probably gathering for some event, really, I couldn’t care less about it. I wanted to get the cart up into the office, and I reckoned it’d be best to avoid everything distracting me from it. I was old now, and that’s what old people do, you know, they’re just tired of everything, right? But the thing is that moments later I saw several people, them, and they were from the gathering, and talking about it. And as some people left and some of us were left behind I became quite curious about the scent of something I caught in the air and soon found the source as it was given to me. It was midday, clear, sunny, and hot. A car bereft of passengers drives itself, slowly, across the highway. The car did not contain any boxes, and these non-existent boxes did not contain toys of any sort. The car passes by an empty city. It then descends down a poorly-maintained ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, I put some items into the car, and then drive it even further down the ramp. Immediately before that, I ran out of an office and three people saw me. I tried explaining what was happening inside, which was to say, nothing. More people arrived, and I gave one person some popcorn. Articles: the, a. Substantives: Outfinite, eleven, evening, cart, Nerf, gun, wind, person, tent, party, Student Center, elevator, Assassins Guild, office, ESP, door, friend, popcorn. Adjectives: full, several, next, three, downstairs, two, one, some. Verbs: to be, to roll, to blow, to start, to push, to pass, to gather, to seem, to enter, to go, to return, to come, to leave, to enter, to talk, to happen, to stay, to offer, to eat. Pronouns: I, what, where, they, that, my, there, who, we, them, me, which. Adverbs: hard, faster, after, behind. Prepositions: at, in, of, by, outside, underneath, up, with, from, about. Conjunctions: so, and. Well, you know, it was night, and I was coming from a, you know, a game. So, you know, I was pushing along this cart, you know, full of, that thing from the game, you know. I mean, it’s sort of, you know, the thing? And then, you know, there were people doing that, you know, that thing outside. And, you know, what happened next, I went up to the, yes, you know, the office, and returned the… things, you know. Well, you know, later on, I left the thing, you know, and went to the other office. You know, that other office! And I saw three, you know, friends, right? And they came from, you know, the thing. Then we uh, you know, talked about a, the party. Someone, you know, that person, then gave me some thing. You know. How can one describe the impression created by the flashy clattering of a cart’s wheels against patterned pavement animatedly jostling its plastic contents up and down in a discordant symphony? How can one express the impression made by the night fall breeze passing through a mesh of metal holes speedily whistling faster and faster as they move in opposite directions? How can one convey the impression given by the sight of throngs of people like particles smoothly bouncing in Brownian motion gathered to loudly celebrate? How can one translate the impression provoked by the jerky flight of a plastic box in a metal box in a metal box in a concrete box in an act of container recursion? Finally, how can one formulate the impression caused by the appearence of three partygoers inside an office room later one of whom carries a small bag of garlicky popcorn?

I have so many people who care about me and so many people I so dearly care about.  As I went around from event to event, re-discovering how the communities on campus choose to express themselves, I felt so happy knowing that I am part of some of these communities and getting the chance to represent them.  I would come back every day and hang around in the lounge, talking to people, making door signs or tea(my only two personality traits), or doing absolutely nothing. I felt very okay in a very good way.  dear past me, At the  
MC^2 conference ⁠ 09 the Multicultural Conference organized by the Office of Minority Education be actively grateful of being here and appreciate everything this place has to offer, instead of focusing on what it requires you to give. When I was mailed the postcard later in the spring, I felt very sad to see that I had not done most of the things I said I would. I was mostly resentful and barely reading and barely getting through the semester.  dear past me, In May, I got an email titled  ‘A letter from the past.’  There is an Orientation event, Dear Future Me, in which all the freshmen write a letter to themselves, one year in the future. When I first read it, I didn’t even recognize I wrote that. I remembered nothing of it. The good part though was that even though I was overly optimistic in the letter, I had still managed to do a lot of what I said in the letter. when you get this, i hope you realize that you’ve come a long way and i hope you would’ve grown and be a different person than i am today. and be unapologetic of the change.  dear past me,  yes, I know. I didn’t get around to do fire spinning or a digital arts UROP. I haven’t seen sunrise from the Harvard bridge yet. I couldn’t do glassblowing or a fellowship with PKG.  but dear past me,  I did take poetry classes. I started writing more regularly. I can mostly navigate through Cambridge and Boston. I found a community I can’t imagine being without.  I have started to feel home here. dear past me, During REX, I finally realized how much I changed in the past year. There are some changes I could point out, write out explicitly, and some that I just can’t quite put my finger on but one thing is for sure, I have grown.  oh, and dear future me,  after convolutions and seemingly unravelable knots, everything always works out. if you remember a sliver of who I am today, you will know that everything is important and nothing is ever too important. so, care. but care only as much as you could ever hope to carry.  august 30, 2022 #Freshman Orientation #REX

 in the business world, a  unicorn  is a startup with a valuation of over one billion dollars. this says very little about the internals of the company – there are many examples of unicorns with almost zero revenue (apna’s estimated revenue was ~2mil/year when its valuation hit 1bil) or which have never come close to profitability (doordash loses a few hundred million dollars per quarter). valuation is a subjective number determined by investors and venture capitalists, and it is only meant to serve as a rough estimate of a company’s expected value in the distant future people can be unicorns too. not in the business sense of the word, since, barring strange web3 schemes that try to tokenize people, individuals don’t have valuations or investors. but there are people where the general consensus is that they will have a “successful” future, even though success isn’t well-defined, and even if, like some unicorn companies, there isn’t much concrete evidence that their current trajectory will bring them “success” i have often been feeling like a unicorn lately, and it’s not because i expect to be worth a billion dollars in the future. rather, what i mean is that people often tell me that i’m doing great or that they believe in me, but i have no idea why on earth they would think those things. i don’t have much to show for my time in college other than a smattering of low-impact  projects  and a lot of friends. i trust my ability to do exactly three things: read, write, and talk to people. every other skill i’ve supposedly demonstrated is not something i’m confident i can replicate – sure, maybe there was that one time where i worked on a cool website or came up with a good research idea or resolved a mental health problem, but if i’ve only done these things once or twice then how can i know i’ll be able to do them again when i need to? last week one of my friends told me:  it’s cool that you’ve explored so many different areas. you worked on biotech and crypto and psych. you can literally do anything you want after college.  i wanted to cry after they said that, because it was such a break from how i’ve been viewing the world. how is it possible that when my friend looks at my life they conclude that i can do  anything , yet when i look at my life i genuinely feel like i’m able to do  nothing ?  i don’t think i suffer from imposters’ syndrome. my issue isn’t thinking that i’m worse than other people or that i don’t belong, but rather that i don’t believe in small sample sizes. i know i’ve done a few things which have been meaningful and significant, but lone data points never have the power to generalize, so i have a hard time believing that i’ll do anything meaningful or significant in the future the problem is that i only get one life, so i will never have enough statistical evidence to prove anything substantial about myself. my crisis is a spiritual one, and i do not know where to find the confidence to resolve it. i’m reminded of this beautiful line from  fight club :  “We have no Great War, no Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives.” iii.  what does it mean to be a unicorn far from profitability? it means a company has a few impressive strengths (like user count or an excellent team) but also a few serious problems that it hasn’t solved yet (like distribution or monetization). it means that there are still important decisions up ahead, and some of the options will lead to extreme success while others will lead to continued unprofitability. the valuation is an average over all potential paths, but of course only one of these paths will ever be realized i am trying to figure out what to do next year, but i do not have the foresight to understand which paths will lead to me rotting away and which paths will lead to me thriving. without realizing it i have acquired a lot of optionality, and now i am realizing how worthless and overvalued optionality is, because it must all be discarded soon, because all the options will soon collapse into one path anyway that, by the way, is the only thing i’m sure of – that i will decide soon. i have no idea what i’ll decide on, but i won’t  sit in front of the fig tree, struggling to decide on a fig to pick, while all the figs wither away . it is the one path i know to avoid at all costs  recently i’ve been thinking about nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence as a way to keep my life in perspective: “What if, some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence.’… Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‘You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine!'” i’m not sure what i want, but i know that i don’t want to throw myself down and gnash my teeth when i face this demon based on my limited understanding of his writing, nietzsche believes the difference between people who despair and people who rejoice when confronted with eternal recurrence is not that one group has better lives than the other. rather, the difference is just that one group has the confidence to affirm their own life and to choose it over and over again, while the other group doesn’t. this is a kind of confidence that i have only ever seen a handful of times in my life, and i wonder where it comes from. it is a confidence that i could really use right now  i’ve known for a long time that i perceive other people very differently from how i perceive myself when interacting with others, i utilize  inference  very freely. often within thirty minutes of meeting someone, i’ll have some good guesses as to their personality, what they care about, how i’d expect them to behave in different situations, and so on. those guesses aren’t always correct, but the point is that i allow myself to come to conclusions without worrying too much about rigor. for example, i enjoy inferring whether people like or dislike each other based on very limited evidence, and over the past year i’ve become pretty accurate in predicting when my friends will date or break up and yet when it comes to myself, i refuse to make the same kinds of inferences. i demand justification and large sample sizes and proofs. i don’t trust that i’ve learned a subject until i’ve demonstrated repeated mastery over it, i don’t trust that i’ve changed until old habits are so long gone that my friends barely remember them, and so on. i am unwilling to jump to conclusions about myself, maybe because the stakes are higher or maybe because i’m more afraid of mischaracterizing myself than i am of mischaracterizing others. and as a result of all this aversion, my predictions for other peoples’ futures are often more accurate than my predictions for my own  i am learning to care less about proofs and guarantees, and to embrace heuristics and induction. in other words, i am learning to develop a more fluid model of myself. the challenge is doing so in a way that isn’t confining or prescriptive, in making sure that whatever models i use for self-understanding don’t cement themselves and become self-fulfilling. i used to think such models were abstract and impractical, byproducts of people with too much time on their hands. now i believe they are indispensable in struggling to decide what to do after college, i have realized that i don’t understand myself as well as i thought, and i’ve also realized that it is impossible to consistently make good decisions without a good understanding of myself. people who approach hard choices without knowing what they want usually end up adopting the values of the loudest voices in their lives, because those values are the metrics they best understand for me some of those loud voices include the tech community (which values grinding on startups), my parents (who value financial security and favor going into finance), and academia (which values curiosity and working on interesting problems regardless of utility). in theory i could just pick one of these voices to listen to and probably do a good job of optimizing my life with respect to its value system, but that feels like doing myself a disservice. i have been procrastinating for a while now, and would much rather take the time to finally confront the question at the heart of the problem: what do i actually care about? i don’t have an answer yet, but the video  how to cook beans and resist dread  has given me a lot of comfort lately: “…think about how really you’re just sort of a flesh worm with limbs. How there’s a tube that goes through the middle of you, just like there is for many other animals. Perhaps you should be a bit more forgiving of yourself, you know, given that you’re literally a mammal. Like, you’re basically an advanced squirrel… Of course you get scared and don’t know which way to turn in your life.” i am an advanced squirrel working on a problem far more abstract and ill-defined than any task our brains have evolved to excel at. i suppose i should be more forgiving of myself

I picked up this trick from my last UROP supervisor,  and I was kind of hoping that the guilt of having murdered two baby trees would also get me to actually read these papers. It did not. I carried a small pile of paper and the weight of shredding two baby trees with me but only periodically read a page or three. To be clear, the problem is not that I don’t like thinking about making mice poop with lasers. I signed myself up for this SuperUROP, and they gave me the freedom to choose where I wanted to take this project, and I am excited that they’re giving me this much freedom because I’ve wanted to go
 
optogenetically poke things ⁠ 08 more on this later, by which I mean, after I make some slides to actually present my project As of late, I’ve been asking Dylan R. ‘24 to put me in “email purgatory” — where I’m stuck in my current location and Dylan stares at me menacingly until I respond to all relevant emails in my inbox — and it’s kept my inbox surprisingly clear. So I asked Dylan to put me in papurgatory, an extension of email purgatory, except in this case I read 115 pages and write a few short paragraphs on their relevance for my work while Dylan finishes their 8.07 pset. We hauled our backpacks and some large fuzzy blankets up to the roofdeck. I do my one (1) roofdeck cartwheel. I stick in my earbuds and start aggressively shoving more information into my head to a soundtrack of sad instrumental music and the scratching of Dylan’s Apple Pencil. At some point, Grace S. ‘23 and Aquila S. ‘23 appear and start meditating nearby, so now I’m working to a soundtrack of sad instrumental music, the scratching of Dylan’s Apple Pencil, and a meditative podcast rambling into the void. Sometimes I feel pretty lonely because a) I don’t always enjoy working in pset groups and b) I spend a lot of time working. I’ve never really pset with other people before, mostly because I have trouble hanging on to my train of thought when other people are also injecting their trains of thought, which makes psets take me several times as long as they would’ve otherwise. For some reason, I’d subconsciously assumed that since the most common way to work together didn’t work well for me, I was just doomed to work alone. I’d never really thought about finding different ways to work with people, especially as most of my friends are in wildly different majors and classes, but I did leave our little motley roofdeck crew with 89/115 pages read. This is maybe a strange definition of “working with people,” but it is one I enjoy, and I’m okay with that. #6.uar

I’m taking 21W.744, The Art of Comic Book Writing, taught by  Marjorie Liu , meaning that we are writing the descriptions that will then be given to an illustrator. Then this illustrator will take our script and transform it into the comics you know and love. This is an especially challenging task because comics live in the in-between of novels and movies. Novels allow for endless words — descriptions and dialogue that can enhance our understanding of the world and the situation. Movies are moving pictures, giving us motion and timespan and an easy to follow path. Comic books, though, are static images that rely more on its pictures to tell story rather than its dialogue. For our first assignment of the class, we were challenged to write a script for a three-paged comic about anything we would like. We actually didn’t have to illustrate it, but I thought it would be a neat challenge to illustrate it and see the difference between writing and drawing. Here is that script in it’s picture form and script form. ATOMIC FRIENDS PAGE ONE PANEL 1 Title text: ATOMIC FRIENDS Text should be in all caps and in handwritten script to make the comic feel more journaled/blog-like. PAGE ONE PANEL 2 A young 14 year old girl, Cami, with her hair tightly pulled back sits in a high school chemistry classroom reading a thick hardcover textbook titled ‘HONORS CHEMISTRY’. The cover of the textbook has some vague chemistry-like things on it like atoms and Erlenmeyer flasks and beakers filled with nondescript liquids. An Expo marker drawing of Niels Bohr is drawn onto a whiteboard in the background, with his name next to the sketch. Cami sits at the desk reading the textbook expressionless. CAPTION: In the 9th grade… CAPTION: I learned about Bohr’s atomic model. PAGE ONE PANEL 3 A simple scientific drawing of the Bohr atomic model sits in the middle of the panel. The background can be black or can be some purple-bluey space color, whichever fits best. There should be at least one electron in one of the orbits, with a squiggly line going into the electron to depict energy going in and another squiggly line coming out of the electron pointing to the next       orbit. CAPTION: According to Bohr, atoms have discrete energy levels they can occupy. CAPTION: And with enough energy, they could jump to the next level or leave the atom altogether. PAGE ONE PANEL 4 Current-day Cami is closer to the frame, smiling and staring off at her friends sitting at a lunch table in the distance. The surrounding is the New Vassar cafeteria. Around the lunch table are 4 friends, with each friend having a corresponding atomic orbital above their head, n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4. The friends are generic and nondistinctive, except for the one with n=1. n=1 is Liam, who wears glasses and has soft brown hair that swoops to the side. He wears a plaid button up and has an awkward, but kind look to him. To Cami’s right, depicted in her thought bubble, is the Bohr model, but instead of electrons, it’s her friends’ faces and her as the nucleus. CAPTION: I used to think friendships followed this model, too. PAGE TWO PANEL 1 (contains 2 panels) PANEL 1A Cami and Liam are laying in a bed of grass at night, staring into nothingness. They look contemplative and content. PANEL 1B The same scene as before but Cami has her mouth open, speaking, her eyebrows furrowed a bit. CAMI: Do you think rocks are sentient? 
LIAM: Yeah, I’d say so. CAPTION (PANEL 1): Where my closest friends took the least energy to be around, PAGE TWO PANEL 2 Cami talks with one of her friends, once again a generic face without much detail. Above their head hangs an atomic label, n=4. Cami is smiling at her friend. The smile is warm, but maybe a little strained. The friend’s face is also this blank smile, like a default reaction. Pleasantries. CAMI: So how are classes? FRIEND: They’re okay! CAPTION: more distant ones required more conscious effort. PAGE TWO PANEL 3 A fourteen year old Cami sits in her high school chemistry classroom, watching her teacher at the front of the room draw on the whiteboard. Her back is to the panel and we can see an angled side portrait of her face where she is studious and attentive. The main focus is on her teacher, who is pointing at a diagram drawn on the whiteboard and explaining how more energy is required to eject electrons that are closer to the nucleus, and farther away electrons require less energy. The squiggles from before can be used to depict this. Her professor is a heavy-set, pear-shaped man with large eyebags underneath beady black eyes. His hair, a small tuft of black combed over to one side, is thinning. He looks determined as he explains this concept. Note that though the teacher looks strict, he is also kind deep at heart, like somewhat of a grumpy teddy bear. CAPTION: In Bohr’s model, it takes a tremendous amount of energy for closer electrons to be ejected from the atom. PAGE TWO PANEL 4 PANEL 4A Current Cami looks again at the lunch table but this time a chair is empty. We see friends n=2, n=3, and n=4 but decidedly n=2 is missing. Cami is frowning and confused in his absence, with her phone just barely in frame. PANEL 4B A zoom in shot on Cami frowning down at her phone, with her phone completely in view. The phone shows a text conversation between her and Liam. It’s all messages from Cami: PHONE MESSAGES: A week ago Lunch? Four days ago Lunch? Two days ago Lunch? CAPTION (PANEL 4): Which is why it was especially confusing when one of my close friends suddenly disappeared. PAGE THREE SPLASH This splash should take up about half the page. It’s a close up of the electron cloud model of the atom, a nucleus at the center with an outwards radial gradient meant to represent electrons. Drawn on top of this depiction is the prototypical atom model, with ellipses drawn as light streaks to depict electron movement. CAPTION: It turned out Bohr’s model was wrong. CAPTION: Instead, atoms follow the electron cloud model, where electrons surround the nucleus in a giant cloud. The next major image should be a super close up of the atomic model, zoomed in on the nucleus and its first orbit. We see the nucleus in view and we only see part of the orbit, with an electron zooming around the nucleus. The electron can be slightly blurred and with speed lines. The electron appears further along the orbit, solid now, showing it’s moving along the arc. CAPTION: Electrons are free moving in this big cloud. CAPTION: Usually we can guess where they are pretty well. CAPTION: But sometimes we can’t. PAGE THREE PANEL 1 Cami stands in the hallway. The posters on the wall behind her all indicate winter events, like ice skating, hot cocoa, upcoming Christmas break. She’s dressed in a thick snow jacket with boots and a scarf, her cheeks slightly tinged with pink from the cold. She looks down at her phone, looking slightly perplexed. She’s chewing on her bottom lip and her eyebrows are furrowed in concern. PHONE (SFX): BZZT! CAPTION: I think friendship is the same. PAGEL THREE PANEL 2 A zoom in on Cami’s phone. It is once again a conversation with Liam. We still see her past messages at the top, the three “Lunch?”es. The last “Lunch?” was sent Sep 8. The new message comes from Liam, seen at the bottom of the phone. It reads: Today Hey! I’m sorry I’ve been MIA. Lunch to catch up? Her thumb hovers over the send button. Typed into the message field is a simple “sure !!” CAPTION: Sometimes, electrons just float onto the outskirts. PAGE THREE PANEL 3 Cami and Liam sit at a small lunch table. We see just the back of Cami’s head and the shot is more focused on Liam, still wearing the same glasses but his face is a bit more angular and chiseled, with maybe some slight scruff. It’s as if he’s gone through something, matured a bit. He looks relaxed as he talks to Cami, softness in his eyes, a slight smile as he talks. LIAM: How’ve you been? CAPTION: But they’re not out there forever. Sometimes, they find their way back in. #21W.744

This isn’t about cross-registering at Harvard. I was thinking about cross-reg, but I didn’t want to overload myself this semester. It’s about a running joke between Fatima and me that started about a week before Orientation, when I decided on a whim to get a Harvard library card, which is free for MIT students. I filled out an online application and reserved an appointment at Widener Library, where they checked my government-issued ID and proof of vaccination. Appointments like these usually make my social anxiety shoot up, but the lady at the counter was pretty nice to me the entire time. Because the campus center was closed by the time my appointment ended, I had to go the next day to pick up my card. Fatima, who also wanted to get a library card, came with me and we both got our cards fresh out of the printer. Everything seemed too easy, so we went to the Cabot Science Library to make sure our cards worked. They did! It was going great. There was an event for freshmen going on that day, so it looked less like a library and more like a mini convention center. People gathered around numerous booths set up along the walls of the library, chatting with the organization leaders there and taking free items from the tables. At the very front of the venue was the chief of all the booths—a shiny prize wheel in front of a heap of good prizes. A Harvard athlete, this big guy who was probably taller than both Fatima and me combined, closely guarded the treasure. We approached the booth with the apprehension, yet bold curiosity, of two thieves crawling into a dragon’s den. Our objective was to walk out of that library with   from that prize wheel in our hands. The athlete smiled at us and held up a QR code. He made us download some app called the “CrimZone,” the whole purpose of which is for getting students to go to Harvard’s sports events. We had to fill out a profile and check-in to the event before we could spin the wheel, so Fatima and I made up fake identities on the spot. Our guises somehow worked, or the guy just didn’t care enough to stop us. We got a tote bag and a cup. Afterwards, we got busy with  
REX ⁠ 01 Residence Exploration. MIT Freshmen explore the different dorms and go to student-hosted events to figure out which dorm they want to live in. A week ago, Fatima and I both received this notification at approximately 5pm. I had just woken up from a nap and was greeted by this cryptic message. We opened the app again. In the midst of blazing through the profile section to spin the wheel last time, we didn’t get to see the other features the app had. First, we played around with our profiles. Whether or not we still look like legit Harvard students is up for contention. me ft. saul goodman from the hit show breaking bad fatima ft. family guy death pose Some of the other features the app has to offer: The leaderboards caught our attention. We were far from making it on the leaderboard for reward points, which wasn’t a surprise since we haven’t gone to any of Harvard’s sports events in the first place. But the kicker was that   has ever used the “Follow” feature but us. We were the only users who had any fans at all. So we’re the only people on the leaderboard specifically for people with the most fans on the app. And that’s how we started off our school year: winning a competition that nobody else cares about.

Putting together a semester’s course schedule is a nontrivial endeavor. Aside from making sure that I’m on track to graduating on time, there’s a lot of “darn I can’t take class A if I take class B because they have mandatory lectures at the same time, but if I push back class B to another semester I’ll have to take it with class C which is an estimated 20 hours/week… aiya I give up.” And no less than five seconds later, I’ll reopen my  firehose Courseroad 
course audit ⁠ 01 website that shows which major requirements you have and have not completed; handy for making sure you're graduating on time 
upperclassmen ⁠ 02 yes i know that i'm technically an upperclassman right now. just let me live my wee underclassman days for one last blog Even better, there is no standardized system for determining who gets to take an overenrolled class. Generally, priority is first given to seniors who need that class to graduate, then based on descending class year and whether you’re a major/minor. But the specifics and exactly when you’re notified of whether you have a spot in that class are subject to the whim of the professor.  Some ask preregistered students to detail why they want to take their class through an
 
email ⁠ 03 the anxiety of writing an email to a writing professor as to why you want to take their writing class I’d like to share the classes I’m taking this semester, but they’re still in flux. Instead, I’ll share some instances where I was really glad I emailed a professor about something related to course scheduling. In many of these instances, had I not complained about these situations to an emotional support upperclassman, I wouldn’t have known to ask.  1. Ask the prof to save you a seat ahead of time Sorry this is no longer timely given that the semester is already in full swing, but mayhaps you’ll find this useful for future semesters. If you know way before Registration Day that you want to take a certain class with an enrollment cap, email the prof asking if they can save you a seat! Bonus points if you wax poetic about how your whole life has been leading up to taking this class. I’ve heard that doing so has gotten someone into How to Stage a Revolution, a fairly popular class. Obviously you don’t have to be this dramatic, but it generally helps your case to state your interest.  2. Ask the prof if you can still join their class I was so certain and excited about taking 21W.744 Art of Comic Writing, until I realized that it conflicted with another highly anticipated class with mandatory lectures. Pushing that other class back another semester would force me to either take a hell semester or overhaul my Courseroad for my remaining time at MIT. Begrudgingly, I chose the other class over 21W.744, for which I stupidly did
 
not preregister. ⁠ 04 did i mention you should always preregister for classes that you're even vaguely interested in? Fate had it that I didn’t get into the other class! There I was, feeling dejected about not being able to take either class… until Rihn the wonderful upperclassman swooped over to say, “What if you just emailed the comic writing prof?” So I did. It would be an overexaggeration to say I poured my heart and soul into explaining how much I loved drawing comics and wanted to improve on the writing part, but I did try. The prof initially emailed back saying that the class was full, but then opened a spot for me a few days later!  I absolutely love this class and will not drop it for anything this semester. It’s going to be so worth the Courseroad overhaul and upcoming hell semester (easy to say because that’s a problem for future me). Every week we’ll write a comic script, so I’m hoping to end up with a few good scripts that I can
 
illustrate ⁠ 05 (and maybe publish?? 🥺)  in my own time afterwards.  3. Ask the prof to save you a seat for next year While I was dealing with the comic writing vs other highly anticipated class dilemma, I preregistered for 21W.784 Apocalyptic Storytelling as a backup plan. While I’ve never been super into dystopian novels, another wonderful upperclassman Zawad had given me rave reviews about 21W.784. After getting off a rather long waitlist, I realized it conflicted with yet another class with mandatory lectures. So of course I instantly went to Zawad to work through this new dilemma. “What if you just emailed the prof to save you a seat for next year?” So I did. I made sure to stress the fact that next fall, my  senior  fall, will be my last chance to take 21W.784. The prof said sure! Problem solved.  when in doubt, preregister when in doubt, email the prof not explicitly stated anywhere above, but scheduling issues are inevitably going to throw curveballs (tbh more like explosive bowling balls) at the Courseroad you’ve just spent hours curating. don’t get too attached to them.

When I first arrived at MIT last year, the International Student Office gave a presentation about adjusting to life in the alien environment that was the United States. As a chronically online Gen Z-er, I’d already consumed so much American media that I felt more than ready for this transition. However, nothing could have truly prepared me for the absolute travesty that is… American cream soda. It do be like that sometimes Cream soda was one of my favourite drinks back home in South Africa; naturally, I was excited to learn that it also existed in the US. None of the MIT dining halls has the drink, though, so I lived in blissful ignorance about the atrocity of the American version for about a month. That all changed one fateful night during a  Phineas and Ferb  marathon. What exactly is cream soda anyway? Cream soda (sometimes spelt “creme soda”) is traditionally an ice-cream-flavoured soda (hence the name). The specific taste varies across different countries, but it’s almost always vanilla flavoured. For example, South Africa’s version is less creamy with a light, rosy/floral taste, while the Japanese make theirs from melon soda and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I actually didn’t know that the base flavour was vanilla until a few years ago! That’s partially due to how prevalent creme soda is  as a flavour  in South Africa. I grew up eating cream-soda-flavoured candies, drinking cream-soda-flavoured milk, and (only once because it was kinda gross) eating cream-soda-flavoured cereal. Back to  Phineas and Ferb In the episode “Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs To You!”, the gang visits Baljeet’s uncle  Sabu who owns a rubber factory in the Himalayas. Sabu proceeds to burst into a song about how he manufactures nothing but rubber bands and rubber balls. It was all well and good until he started listing things that the factory doesn’t produce. Suddenly, an image of “cream soda” appeared for just a second; just a second was enough for all the world’s evils to escape Pandora’s box. I paused the video and stared at the screen in disbelief. The frame that proves Phineas and Ferb is a work of fiction Notice anything wrong in this frame? Probably not if you’re an American reader, but ask any South African, and they’ll tell you the cream soda in that drawing… Is not green. Green cream soda I couldn’t believe my eyes – surely it was just some animation error? No, it couldn’t be – a big animation studio like Disney wouldn’t make such a blatant mistake. What if it’s nothing but an indication that the show takes place in a fictional universe? Maybe if I could get a second opinion from my friends… To my horror, none of them saw the glaring mistake staring them in the face. Some didn’t even know what cream soda was! To my friends’ horror, I showed them a photo of the emerald-green drink I knew and loved. “Why would it ever be that colour?” “Neither vanilla nor cream is green, though.” “Are you sure that’s safe to drink? It looks radioactive.” I’d heard horror stories from my international friends (Italians in particular) about American versions of their food back home, but I never imagined it would happen to me too. Here were my friends, 18 years old and still thinking that cream soda is brown! I knew I needed to show them the truth, but unfortunately, I had no correctly-coloured cream soda on hand. Luckily, one of my friends has Pakistani parents who visited MIT around then. I explained my plight to them, and they were kind enough to send over a can of Pakola (Pakistani cream soda) for us to try. Everyone agreed that it was delicious, but alas, many of them remain non-believers. Hopefully, the proceeding list will change that: Top 10 (totally legit) reasons why cream soda should be green Green is a fun colour and adds a splash of life to any meal. Green also makes it seem exotic; almost healthy, even. It’s also good for your eyes, and a  2016 study  found that exposure to the colour helps you live longer. The drink tastes so different from vanilla ice cream that they don’t need to share colours. The colour also adds mystique to the drink’s flavour, and I think discovering the base flavours of cream soda should be a major milestone in everyone’s life. The ice cream soda’s inventor is none other than Robert M.  Green . Coincidence? I think not. Green makes the drink unmistakable; brown and beige are bland, generic and overused. It’s already green in so many other countries, so the US may as well follow suit. Sparletta cream soda (the biggest cream soda brand in South Africa) has smiley faces on its bottles. American cream soda has nothing but sadness. There is simply no other colour that cream soda should be. Moral of the story This post was just meant to be a tongue-in-cheek rant about a drink that many of you probably have never heard of before, but most other blogs seem to involve some character development too. I suppose I learned that you never really know what will be different at college (or in any new environment). Sometimes only minor things change, but the small things often make the biggest difference. Addendum “Cream Soda” I actually found a bottle of American cream soda recently in La Verdes! I bought it and had a cream soda tasting party with my friends, and it tasted… n ot the best. I guess the true moral of the story is to eat your greens, kids (and by “greens”, I mean correctly-coloured cream soda). #cream soda #food #international

It’s 7:59am. The natural lighting fills the room– every square inch of a pink shag rug, and every piece of laundry that I still need to do– but none of that is important right now. It’s the first day of Junior year, and then, after a complete 60 seconds of awkward silence as the camera pans around the dorm room, it’s 8am, and an alarm goes off. A hand slams against it, and the beginning notes to  The Middle  by Jimmy Eat World
 
[0:00] ⁠ 01 to be clear this is the time stamp in the song, I will use these this post I used to hate the first week of classes, especially in high school. I hated how boring it was. The droning on of teachers talking
 
about academic integrity ⁠ 02 yes this is important I know but still 
But then, ⁠ 03 to repeat a phrase that is in almost every conversation about high school memories And MIT… is anything but boring. [0:35] The front door of Next House swings open, and the trek from Where the Sidewalk Ends to Where the Sidewalk Begins begins.  But then again, everyone has their own subjective view of what boring is. For instance, some find the 10 minute walk (or dead sprint, tomato tomato) from Next House to campus boring. I find it just long enough for a good conversation with a friend on the way to classes, and the perfect amount of time to let the mind wander and daydream before coming down to Earth and having to “be an MIT student”. The first day of classes had a daydreaming sort of walk. I was wondering about the narrative arcs of my life that had ended with summer, the arcs in progress, and those that are just beginning. I find it peaceful to think like this at times. Growing up, I used to imagine my life as some sort of TV show where the live studio audience was my consciousness and the executive producer was some form of a higher power. Some of my friends think this sort of framework may not be the most healthy– something something “Life doesn’t work out like a satisfying story.”– but I think that is what makes the story  interesting . In life there are any number of times when a friendship randomly ends, or when a person you cared deeply about sadly passes away. But I think it is helpful, to me at least, to think about the idea of this being a part of  some  story. And with the new year comes a new season.  So, the walk from Next House to campus was a daydreaming one. [1:35] The camera pans upwards towards the sky, and then quickly smash cuts to a hallway filled with students, some in a rush, some catching up with friends, and some, like Paige, with their headphones on listening to music and imagining what this scene would look like if it was a part of a 2007~ teenage coming of age film while they walk to class. One narrative arc that ended was Sophomore Year! Oh my god I am somehow on the latter half of my MIT undergraduate experience, and yet here I am still not knowing
 
where Building 26 is. ⁠ 04 spoiler alert, it’s the one with 26-100, which in hindsight, I should’ve remembered The last two years were pretty alright. I mean sure, the first year was remote, but if nothing else the last year was really  something . I tried new things. Joined clubs. Learned so much math. I invested a lot of time into academics (and writing), but I didn’t really invest time in my social life? The life I have after I throw my backpack onto the floor and feel the (literal and physical) weight be lifted off of my shoulders. I didn’t buy dorm decor and didn’t spend much time in my room as it was. I packed my backpack in the morning, went to campus, and when I came back in the evening I was ready to go to bed. But near the end of the semester, I found myself doing  more  in a way that didn’t feel  extra . It was just  fun . Like, during finals week my friends and I watched  Everything, Everywhere, All at Once ,
 
and then ⁠ 05 after a brief crying session a few of us walked around Boston. Stargazing in Boston is a very different experience than in the suburbs of a relatively small quiet town in California. My friends and I found ourselves at the Boston Harbor, where the high tide caused the water to overflow onto the sidewalk, which was more than enough to tempt the four of us to take off our shoes and socks and wade into the water. One senior even jumped in. And for the first time during finals week, I wasn’t stressed about chemistry anymore. I thought I would be stressed– I thought I would spend the entire night worrying over whether or not hanging out with friends would be my undoing. But of course
 
it wasn’t. ⁠ 06 and even if it was I could’ve put it on PNR  Instead, it was just nice to be with friends. And I started to realize that this feeling of relief and calm when I kicked my feet in the water was one I needed to start exploring in the narrative arc that is Junior Year. [1:59]  The Middle  starts to fade out, being completely silent at [2:20]. The camera smash cuts again to a classroom, probably a math one, in which the professor says some profound thing whose importance will only be understood by the end of the semester (or at least the end of some arc I can’t see yet). Paige takes a note to revisit this blog later to see if some profound thing like that comes to light. So what awaits in the Junior Year arc? Well for one thing, being a blogger. I’ve applied a few times (three to be exact), but have been writing around campus for a while on a personal blog and for  The Tech , and I’m glad to be *gestures vaguely to the World Wide Web* here. On a more general note, I think this is really the year of settling into whatever “role” I play at MIT. For instance, since moving into
 
my room at Next, ⁠ 07 where I am going to stay next year as well, love squatting rights  I’ve started decorating. I got a fuzzy pink rug, and lofted my bed, and bought a rolly cart to store various mugs for when friends come over in the winter and drink hot cocoa or tea (or COFFEE!!). I got a sunset lamp that changes colors– perfect for adjusting to any vibe– and a simple clip-on lamp– perfect for late night reading, cramming, or blogging. And now, when I look around my room, I see a Home: A place I want to be, and a place I want others to experience, and a place I want to make memories. So I’m starting/trying to step into some role of “chill Next 2East” upperclassman. But I’m also trying to figure out who I want to be with math. There are so many things I want to do, and we only have four, short, short years here and there is never enough time. (No music playing.) Quick smash cut to every time the word “PSET due” was said in a class during the first two days of school, with a graphic visual of an
 
insane Google calendar starting to fill. ⁠ 08 Not that I use Google Calendar. I should. But also. I like writing things down physically. So. The scene transitions to dialogue (that I won’t write out as dialogue) between Paige and friends around campus. I don’t  dislike  the things I have to do for MIT. After all, the reason I hated the first week of school was because it used to be boring. But all this means is that I need to decide what activities are important to me. For instance, I’m definitely continuing to edit notes for classes. It was something I started a few semesters ago, when I reached out to the professor of a class I was taking and asked if I could give feedback on the lecture notes. He said yes, and surprise surprise reading the notes actually helped me better understand the material. And I started working with professors more! Win win. That being said, this year I’m being paid for it a little. As much as I would love to do things for free, what isn’t free is the coffee that I drink  while  doing them. I also want to teach a class again over IAP– god that was so cool more on that in a later blog– but in any case that requires time to set up during the Fall. And I want to continue my math research I started this summer. And I also– You get the point. I am excited to keep doing things, both in math and in my social life, but it all comes down to choices.  What do I want, and how can I achieve that?  What is weird about MIT is that the “how” of that question never feels impossible, just, difficult. Wake Me up When September Ends (written by Green Day, covered by AcousticTrench) [0:00] starts to play in the background softly as Paige makes the walk back to Next after an exciting but reflective first day of school. Internal monologue continues. MIT is the perfect place to daydream. There are so many things you can just  do , or at least try to. At first, I was hesitant of this idea. For instance, one of the main reasons I came to MIT was because of OCW (OpenCourseWare) : a website full of open educational resources from MIT, online,  for free . And I thought to myself: if I do cool education stuff, this was the place to do it. One semester and a short email later, I started working with OCW! One. Email. Talking to people who know more than you about what you’re passionate about can be so powerful here. The people you talk to can be just the right connection, and the next thing you know your dream is a tangible reality, or at the very least it’s more tangible than the concept in your brain and nowhere else. In the same way though, reality starts to feel like a dream. Which is a great thing! I love getting to exist in a weird liminal space where everyone is just (as Cami perfectly put it in  and they’re going to better places ) “absolutely, [and] unabashedly themselves.” Still, the reality is, that reality isn’t always like MIT. I’m glad I’ve been having cool experiences at MIT, and I hope these will continue to exist for me after I graduate, but at some point these experiences will end. But for now, I think this will have to be an issue for future Paige. Because as much as I hate the first, future Paige will certainly hate the last more.

It is that time of year again! The semester is starting, campus is coming alive, and here on the blogs we have a fresh new crop of baby bloggers to introduce! Staff and senior bloggers read our way through sixty-two applications, went back and forth for hours, wished we could hire just a few more people, and finally after much difficulty went with seven amazing new bloggers. And I am so excited for you to get to read their work! Please give a warm welcome to: of South Africa, connoisseur of fizzy green liquids, owner of a popular LinkedIn meme account, and wizard of modular origami of California, a ham radio enthusiast with her call sign as her kerb, who makes beautiful abstract (and less abstract) art and also. catches bugs of Pakistan, not-so-closet romantic and beautiful poet, who has drunk more milk tea than anyone else I know  of Nevada, spreadsheet queen, went skydiving on her gap year which I just think is freaking awesome, who is on a quest to open every door at MIT of California, prolific blogger extraordinaire and recent joiner of the ranks of the notebook addicted, and the person to ask if you want a coffee shop recommendation of Arkansas, light mode Discord user and frog collector (not live ones as far as I know? but it could still happen!) of Missouri, who I am hoping will publish a book about her coworkers at The Shack Frontenac, varsity golfer and witch of balancing objects on top of each other Their first blogs will be coming very soon, so keep an eye out! And finally, thank you to everyone who applied. It was a privilege to read your words and look at your art; it’s not always easy to share your life with strangers and we’re honoured that you did so.

Since Fall 2018, I’ve lived at WILG, an independent living group at 355 Massachusetts Avenue, a seven-minute walk from main campus. You may know us from my previous blog post where  I investigated a fire that occurred at our house I first moved to WILG after I took a gap year and thus couldn’t get on-campus housing anymore. I used to live in McCormick, and being in a community full of other marginalized genders was important to me, but I didn’t want to stay on the mandatory meal plan. WILG also has a meal plan, but it is all cooked by us! We get dinners six nights a week, as well as plenty of snacks. the theme for this dinner was “purple” We usually go on retreat once a semester and have lots of social events, like mixers with other living groups and an annual formal. Also, we are not required to be “dry”, a.k.a. we can have alcohol in the house. (For any potential employers reading this, I personally would  drink . . .) two of our members at retreat last autumn we had a white elephant swap last december Also, we have bunnies! As promised in the subheading of this blog post, here they are. ear hug In case you’re curious about the house itself, here are some photos of our amenities: our main kitchen our fourth floor kitchen our third floor lounge If I were to be sentimental and talk about what WILG means to me, I would say something like: it is difficult to look back on my time at MIT and not also see it as my time at WILG, since the two are so inextricably intertwined. My memories of dorm life are dim and faraway; I’ve been in this house since fall 2018, save for a year and a half spent elsewhere due to the pandemic. For a long time, I thought that WILG gave me close proximity to people who were very different from me. In my classes, I mostly meet students who are in the same major as me and have the same professional interests as me. At WILG, I meet people in all sorts of majors, wanting to do all sorts of things with their lives after MIT. And this is still true, yes, but I’ve also come to realize that WILG attracts people with similar values: people who place importance on self-reliance, on creating a community distanced from institutional authority, and on eating yummy food. I’ve met a lot of the most important people in my life through WILG. I do believe that serendipity and geographic proximity plays some role: after all, who is to say that I wouldn’t have an equally fulfilling and amazing support system elsewhere? But it helped that WILG has a lot of queer women and non-binary people of color, and it helped that WILG has a lot of people who have taken time off from MIT or need more semesters to graduate. It helped that I never feel academic or professional pressure at WILG: I haven’t encountered any of the typical “so where are  interning this summer” posturing that is prevalent in some other corners of this school. But that’s what I would say if I were sentimental. I’m one of the rush chairs for WILG this semester, and we are looking for new members!

As they said in the old, more hardkore days of MIT, you all might have heard of a liberal arts school down the road. It’s got buildings of red brick and marble, Corinthian columns, old-style decor. T-shirts that bear its name are sold everywhere from the airport to Boston Commons. That name is Harvard. Harvard has another feature, known as a wide variety of humanities classes.  Don’t get me wrong, MIT has its share of humanities. I’ve taken classes from the history of the French Revolution, to Latinx studies, to a literature class on dystopian novels. However, looking through the  Harvard catalog Fortunately, MIT makes it quite easy to cross-register for up to two classes at Harvard. This semester, I took advantage of that for the first time, and cross-registered for two classes: one on Irish folklore, the other a writing seminar with a focus on re-telling fairy tales. Want to cross-reg? Simply choose a class in the vast and expansive Harvard  course catalog Here’s my first impressions of those classes: , not numbers, and the courses are referred to by the material they cover, like ‘abstract algebra,’ so I know what major people are and what classes they’re taking. It’s actually a fairly efficient method of sharing information. Harvard has its own jargon, too, though it doesn’t seem to have as much. On the first day, we introduced ourselves by class year (“junior”),
 
concentration, ⁠ 01 I was too focused on not saying a number that I forgot this is Harvard's word for 'major'  There’s something to be said for brutalism, and windows that are either very large or very small, and generally do not open. But back in high school, I’d pictured myself on a pretty green campus with historic architecture and libraries that smelled like old books. I enjoy how Harvard fills that for me now. steps of the fancy majestic Lamont library, where I used to eat boba with my housemates during the pandemic. ! I dressed well for my first day of Harvard classes — and spent about twice as much time doing so as I did for my first day of MIT classes. I take fashion inspo from my MIT peers all the time. I think that on the whole, however, Harvard tends to dress more colorfully. Less dyed hair, fewer grey or burgundy sweaters.  My writing seminar assigned four novels, to be read in the first four weeks, with additional craft essays and commentaries as well. This is exactly what I was looking for.  also, you tend to find people at Harvard who have chosen to dedicate a greater proportion of their lives to the arts. This makes sense, because at Harvard it is societally easier to major in a humanities field. For example, most people in my advanced fiction workshop at MIT wrote occasionally. Three of us had written novels, out of about fourteen. In my Harvard class, that number was somewhat higher, at least 5 out of fourteen — nearly twice as many.  The bus is late or crowded sometimes, but the ride doesn’t take long — about 20 minutes, including wait times, which is enough time to get from my Irish folklore class to a MechE class at MIT. I’m going to start biking, which will be glorious, I think, for at least two weeks. After that it will be cold and I will shiver and moan.  I don’t mind working in corporate corners of brutalist buildings — and uh, if I did, tough luck — and some study areas in MIT are great. Lovingly, though, those teeny tiny desks in Hayden? The cold fluorescent light of Stud 5? Ech. I may have raved about Mexican fast food before, one of my favorite things about growing up in Tucson.  Felipe’s Jefe’s All this said, I’m glad I went to MIT — I love our culture and communities, our makerspaces and fancy tools, our tunnels and east side dorms (the ones that haven’t been

I went to a lot of classes in the first week of the fall semester. According to my iCal, I have spent nineteen hours in class in the last three days. Why? Because I want to experience everything. look at all those purple blocks Here’s every class I went to: This class is a replacement for Artificial Intelligence, so it would fulfill a requirement I need. The lecture was really good but also noisy construction was happening in the background so I was slightly losing my mind. It was very mathematical, which I liked, but it also seems more difficult than Artificial Intelligence, and if there’s a class I’m investing a lot of effort into this semester, I’m not sure I want it to be this one. I took part of this class last year before dropping it. It is pretty much the same as what I remember. I don’t know if this class will ever be that exciting to me—honestly, I feel like I’m just not that interested in this side of computer science—but it’s manageable. It fulfills the same requirement as 6.4110. I really, really like this class. We get to build our own virtual machine and learn about all the nitty-gritty details of how a language environment works. I just think it’s so fascinating. This course is supposed to be a lot of time and effort, but I think it’s worth it. . Showed up late because I was in 6.1120, not sure how much I truly got out of the last thirty minutes. I didn’t really intend on taking this class. It’s an interesting topic, but the class is supposedly a lot of work, and I’m more interested in other parts of computer science. This was in the same lecture hall as 18.425, which is partially why I went to 18.425. I really like this class too. It aligns well with a lot of web development skills I already have, and front-end development has a really fast feedback loop. Plus, my friends Deniz, An Bo, and Grace are in it, so I don’t have to worry about finding a group for projects. Again, this class is supposed to be a lot of time and effort, but it’s worth it. AI and Web3 for Impact:Venture Studio.  I saw that this class was having a meet-and-greet before the first day of lecture on Thursday, so I went to the Media Lab to see what was up. The current start-up I work at is in the Web3 space, so I thought this class might be a good opportunity. To be honest, it didn’t seem well-aligned with what we were doing, and everybody else I met was a graduate student, so I decided to get some food and leave. My friend Athena was taking this class, so I wanted to tag along and see if I liked it, even though from the summary in the course catalog, I didn’t think I was that interested in the topics. Spoiler alert: I wasn’t that interested in the topics. I’m not really into photography, so learning about the technology behind it doesn’t engage me. The class seemed chill and if there were no other classes I wanted to take, it would definitely be doable. But given that there are other computer science classes I liked better, I didn’t think this was right for me. My friend Deniz was trying to get me to take this class but it’s so much work and I don’t even have all the prerequisites. Anyway, apparently the lecture halls for this class and 18.404, the class I was trying to go to, got switched last minute. So I walked in and saw Deniz sitting in the front row and got very confused, because I was pretty sure he wasn’t taking 18.404. Then he tried to get me to stay but I left before someone made me optimize some C++ or something. On the way out, I ran into my friend Maritza, who also was supposed to be going to 18.404 but was headed to 6.1060 instead. I took half of this class last year before dropping it. It is pretty much the same as what I remember. The professor, Sipser, is excellent, and the course material is fun but so fast. I’m intending on taking this class. Next time I’m going to try to get there early to avoid sitting in the nosebleed section. I didn’t pre-register for this class but my friends Athena and Alexis were taking it, so I decided to go, since I’ve always wanted to take a class in the Women and Gender Studies department. But since I didn’t pre-register and the class was already overenrolled, I got kicked out within the first fifteen minutes, so I just went to Hayden and wrote admissions blog posts for an hour or two. I heard that the class had a dog, though. I’m sad I missed it. THERE WAS ALSO A DOG IN THIS CLASS! Anyway, I decided to go to this lecture because it also fulfills a requirement. I’d heard that there is a lot of overlap with the machine learning class, though. The lecture was pretty slow, but to be fair, this was only the second one (I’d missed the first one for the other AI class, the mathematical one). I decided to go to this class after reading Vincent H. ’23’s blog post where he mentions that it is “like magic.” Class took place in the MIT Nano building and we got n&n’s, which I found hilarious. Then we got to take a tour of the Nano building and wear bunny suits. But I lost interest; I guess I just don’t really like lab classes. So halfway through, I asked to leave. This was slightly embarrassing because most of the time, if I want to leave a class, I can just get up, but this time, I had to be walked out of the lab and instructed how to de-gown (a.k.a. remove my bunny suit). yum

Last fall So, this year, I proceeded to make the exact same set of mistakes as last year. I landed in Boston at 11:59 PM on Saturday, and I was up the next morning at 10:30 AM to give a tour of Next House. I organized the
 
two 4W wing events ⁠ 01 during which we put together a custom 2000-piece puzzle and watched <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/here-i-go-again/"><em>Mamma Mia!</em></a> with first-years. 
their internal move, ⁠ 02 see <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-last-twenty-days/">this post</a> for a better explanation, but, essentially, first-year students at Next go through a process of exploring the various subcommunities of their dorm, after which they pick their own final room assignment. this process occurs in various forms in other dorms. On the Tuesday before classes started, for one of the many introductory meetings that herald the start of a semester, the icebreaker question was “what in the last week were you pleasantly exhausted by?” My honest answer was that I had ceased to be pleasantly exhausted by the previous Tuesday. Instead, I was merely exhausted, in that pure and complete way which saps away any hint of other emotion, positive or negative. Just like the previous year, I had completely drained myself before the semester had even started. Last fall 
LA ⁠ 03 technically this stands for Lab Assistant, but as a Course 6 student, 'lab' really means working on coding assignments, which I feel does not really match up with a person's image of a hypothetical 'lab assistant.' This semester, I am in almost precisely the same number of units as last year; I am in three “hardcore” CS classes, which each spark delight in their own unique ways, a class on musicals, a writing class on (auto)biography, and a smattering of other smaller commitments. I am still in the Asymptones, still on Next Exec, still on DormCon, still sorting mail at Next Desk. Instead of LA or grading roles, I am doing policy research on social media regulation. I am just as busy as I was last fall, if not more. Most dauntingly, new obligations keep slipping in through the cracks. It is almost as if it is impossible for me to last a week without creating some new obligation for myself. I am working with administrators on a particular issue at MIT which means a lot to me; I am sitting as a student representative on the Committee for Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid; I am heavily considering attending more MIT
 
Lindy Hop ⁠ 04 this is a form of swing dancing! I hate dancing and am generally bad at it, but have found swing dancing oddly liberating every time I have done it. only dropped two classes This is my last fall at MIT—or, at the very least, it is the last fall of my undergraduate career here—and it is frustrating to feel like I haven’t learned any lessons at all. After all, it’s my senior fall. I should be taking fewer classes, slowing down, sticking with the things I already have, starting to reap the rewards of three long years of hard work. In some ways, this has happened—I’ve been getting eight hours of sleep every night, my classes don’t start until 11 AM, and I have no required classes on Friday. Yet, I go to bed exhausted every night, and though I’ve learned to say “no” to many opportunities, new ones keep popping up. My overwhelming sense is that I should have adjusted my value function to prioritize my own well-being; that I should be putting my foot down and saying no to everything.  These are the basics of being at MIT; these are  the first things we tell first-years when they step on campus …MIT becomes one of the hardest optimization/prioritization problems you will ever encounter in your near-adult life. Because there is just so much to do all the time, you really want to protect your time at MIT and learn the important lesson of   and  I think my core frustration is that I have still not really figured out  where the balance lies When is it okay to try new things, and when will it destroy you? one’s core values tacking towards the mean And, I suppose, I have been enjoying life—regardless of exhaustion—and maybe that is what matters, rather than the particular idea of optimizing for enjoyment, regardless of if enjoyment happens to be “doing more things” or “doing less things”. I’ve loved sitting in classes, learning about computer system architecture and  and everything in between. I’ve loved the feeling that I am accomplishing some small approximation of progress in my student government roles, and the joy of the give and take of moving around a dance floor with a partner. I’ve been getting good sleep, and eating well, and all the other important bits of life. On the night before classes started, I sat in the 4W main lounge with a bunch of
 
Shirefolk, ⁠ 05 the proper demonym for 4W residents. So, tentatively, I will keep pushing forward, and maybe it will be alright if I merely keep all of these ill-learned lessons in mind, if not in heart. Maybe the only way to learn how to live is to do so, and to stop overthinking what, exactly, it means to thrive. We will find out soon enough, one way or another. It is, after all, my last undergraduate fall.

Since my sophomore year at MIT, I’ve been an  , an undergraduate student that works with MIT faculty to provide support and act as a resource/guide for MIT first-years. This is a program under the  It’s one of the most fulfilling things I do here at MIT and I really have loved watching first-years really fall into their rhythm at MIT. Through these past couple of years, I’ve picked up some advice and tips that my advisees have found helpful and I thought it would be even more helpful to make this information accessible and listed somewhere. It’s hard to be all-encompassing and obviously everyone has their own preferences and ideals and things, so I don’t know just how universal everything in this blogpost would be, but I hope this is helpful in some capacity. GIRs, major requirements, discovery classes: choosing classes Extracurriculars, Living Groups, and Support: Finding Community Extracurriculars, Work, UROPs, and More: Finding Balance Getting Around and Getting Out: Leaving the MIT Bubble This is probably the most asked question I get every year as an associate advisor: How do I know what to take this year? For starters, CJ has  an excellent blogpost on this. There are very commonly recurring schedule archetypes that you can use as a good template for your schedule.  Take   and add a

This is a good schedule because it (1) allows you to get requirements out of the way even if you have no idea what you want to do at MIT and (2) is a manageable schedule with enough room for extracurriculars and exploration. There are 8 total required HASSes so it’s a good rule of thumb to try and get one out of the way each semester. Take  , ⁠ 02 Note that departments only suggest doing 1 intro class for your major for your first year. If you have other interests aside from your major or are juggling between n>1 major choices, consider adding a   or substituting the HASS CI-H for another   in a different major. This is a good way to still get started on your major requirements without pigeonholing yourself too deep.
 
Many people change their minds on what to major in, ⁠ 03 I changed my major 20 times. , which showcases all of the majors available at MIT. Aside from these, I have some general recommendations. In particular, I recommend that: . You can go past this number (until you hit the max credit limit of 54 units, as of Fall 2022), but anything less won’t be quite representative of the typical MIT experience. their freshman year, if not two. This is technically required, but I know some people who don’t do this, but it usually ends poorly for them since they’re placed on a registration advisory list for not taking 1 CI-H their freshman year. If you’re somewhat of the average MIT student, chances are you don’t like writing all that much. That’s even more of a reason to get your writing requirements out of the way in your freshman year, also known as the chillest year. Because you’re not stapled to a major quite yet, the classes you take in your freshman year are usually going to be reserved for GIRs and major introductory classes. It’ll then be easy to dedicate time to writing an essay as opposed to doing this in your junior year, where you’re then taking 3 other classes that are major-specific and advanced. It’s best to just get the writing out of the way so you can focus on your more relevant classes later on. The Institute (as of Fall 2022) recommends that you take at least  class every year, which is also a good guideline. Note that you  . , which is the Introductory Python course. It’s 6 units so it slots in nicely on top of the 48 units you might already have queued, but if you are someone who is quite new to coding or unconfident in Python, consider swapping out one of your 12-unit classes for  , the longer 9-unit version of 100A dedicated to people who may need more time to grasp coding.  CI-Hs are notoriously difficult to get into, for whatever reason, especially the popular ones (

It’s a great way to destress and also work towards your PE requirements. These do not count toward your credit limit. On average, students take usually between 48-60 units, which roughly translates to 4 or 5 12-unit classes. This is what the usual semester will look like for you as an MIT student, so it’s best to use your freshman fall as test run/simulation for the next four years. Here are some good resources for planning your classes: firehose.guide CourseRoad Now for some hyperspecific situations:  –> Nope. Credit limit can be found  here –> 1. Join the waitlist for the class. 2. Email the professor for the class saying you’re interested in the class for XYZ reasons and you’re currently waitlisted. 3. Show up to the class even if you’re waitlisted. This is because if someone doesn’t show up to the first day, waitlisted students that are present will then take their spot. It is a nontrivial chance you can get into the class this way. Obviously, not guaranteed, but a good way to try. With your classes settled, let’s talk a little bit more about… With your classes chosen, let’s talk more about surviving at MIT. Your freshman fall is on PNR for a reason: to give you the chance to build community here. Because you don’t have to spend 100% of your time grinding and studying for classes, you’ll have a lot of free time to figure out how to fall into the groove of MIT.

But, truly, the TLDR of this is to  because it will help keep you sane and steady in a place as fast-paced and overwhelming as MIT. A couple quick notes on community that didn’t quite fit: the November  Rule , the mainly unspoken rule on campus of no frosh-upperclassman dating until November. I usually add an addendum of no frosh-frosh dating either, but that’s my personal input. This is a rule that a lot of frosh will scoff or roll their eyes at, but it is probably the most important rule I can think of at MIT. You have traveled hundreds or thousands of miles from home, show up in this intense environment, and are experiencing true independence for the first time in their lives. The last thing you as a freshman could possibly need is a relationship. The November Rule exists so that freshmen focus solely on  . Nisha explains this in her blogpost, but the reason November Rule exists is because an intense romantic relationship can often hinder other relationship building in your life. The worst case scenario that happens all too often is that a frosh ends up dating someone before November, spends a lot of time investing in that relationship, and then they break up and the frosh now finds themself friendless because they spent so much time with that S/O and not enough time finding true support and friend groups at MIT. . They don’t have to be your best friend, but someone you can wave at in the hallways or DM for notes is a good way to ensure you have at least one source of help. (MIT mainly uses Messenger as of Fall 2022…so you should get a Messenger). These have saved my ass a handful of times during my time at MIT. The number of times I’ve messaged in a group chat asking for help with a pset is incredibly high and it’s super helpful. If there’s no group chat for your class, feel free to just make one yourself and add people. This is a great way to get to know people, too! I’ll be the first to say that I am an upperclassman that loves spewing my advice anywhere and everywhere I can, but I will also acknowledge the fact that there are in fact different strokes for different folks. Some people here vehemently hate Greek Life while others swear by it. Some people love XYZ professors while others would rather endure horrible, horrible fates over interacting with said professors. So for sure lean into upperclassmen, but realize that what worked for them at MIT might not work for you and that is perfectly okay. Now that you have maybe a couple extracurriculars you’re doing and some established support systems at MIT, we can move more into… Even with your extracuriculars, you might find that you still have time do things. Or, probably more likely, you want to make more money on campus to fund yourself during your time here. Totally understandable. Some common places you can find jobs are… statistic that states that more than 90% of MIT students complete MIT with having done at least one paid UROP 
cold email ⁠ 10 Email without knowing them  I know this is a little vague, but I didn’t know what else to call it. You can work   on campus, or find jobs at the   as a program assistant (what I did), or work as assistants or social media interns for various groups and departments on campus. Check your email for opportunities. You can also work desk at the gyms on campus or work desk for your dorm. After doing well in a class or if you’re already qualified, you can get paid for tutoring for a class or being either a lab or teaching assistant for a class. You can message professors saying you’re interested in a position for the class. So now you have a full courseload, a couple extracurriculars, and a job. That’s a lot. How do you balance all of this? Well, that’s the hard part. I always tell first-years that they can be as busy, or as unbusy, as they would like. That’s the beauty of MIT. The downside to this, though, is that there will never be enough time to ever do absolutely everything here. And thus MIT becomes one of the hardest optimization/prioritization problems you will ever encounter in your near-adult life. Because there is just so much to do all the time, you really want to protect your time at MIT and learn the important lesson of   and   Dropping things is necessary at MIT to stay afloat. Of course, it would be better if you could see all activities through to the end, but this simply isn’t realistic. Freshman year is on PNR to help you not only adjust to the college environment, but to also give you a grace period to   See how you handle 3 extracurriculars on top of a 4 class schedule: is it doable? Is this too much? Do you have time to eat, time to go to the gym, time to still hang out with friends spontaneously? Is 3 classes too much, too little? Experiment around and figure out what you want these next four years to look like through this trial period. Through my freshman fall, I tried maybe 8 to 10 different clubs (which I all inevitably dropped) to try and figure out where I wanted to spend my time. I realized I really prioritized making money (jobs) and spending time with friends over than throwing myself into my classes or dedicating myself to extracurriculars too deeply. This PNR semester should be a learning period for you: make mistakes, try everything you want to do, fail fast, and, most importantly of all,  Drop things if it’s boring. Drop it if you don’t like it. Drop it if you’re not passionate about it. And with every drop and keep, you learn a little more about what you want out of your MIT experience. Speaking of MIT experiences, let’s talk about… Perhaps this has faded with time during the pandemic, but MIT undergraduates are notorious for sticking within the “MIT Bubble”, AKA MIT students are not as prone to leaving campus as they should be. We often get so caught up in our classes, various extracurriculars, living communities, and such that we forget that there exists a world outside of MIT, both physically and metaphorically. There are a myriad of ways to escape MIT. Here are some of my personal recommendations for getting around MIT:  or a   (electric optional) once you get to campus. The MIT Police holds  an annual bike auction a subscription based biking service around the Boston-Cambridge area. You can pay a monthly or annual subscription, or just a case by case basis, to rent a bike for less than 45 min at a BlueBike station. Just make sure you return it to a station by the end of your ride and dock it properly! , depending on who you ask, is great. All MIT IDs have a CharlieCard built into it. You can fill your CharlieCard either online or in person at a terminal usually found at every T stop (subway). Note that if you fill in your card online, you must tap a T stop terminal in order to activate your funds, AKA if you fill in your card online you can’t immediately use it on a bus since it won’t acknowledge you filled the card. Buses and the T are a great way to get around. Consider taking the Green Line into Boston, or taking the 1 Bus to Harvard.  is a Cambridge-Harvard Medical School shuttle that Harvard ID havers can ride for absolutely free. It is basically the exact same route as the 1 Bus except, once again, it’s  . Use it.  is a totally viable option and is extremely easy in Boston-Cambridge! It’s a walkable city! The air is great! It’s fresh! Walk!  Alan Z. ’23 can attest to this. a shuttle service that runs about every 30 minutes from campus. There are shuttles that go all across campus, into Boston, and also into Brookline and Cambridge. There even are shuttles that take you to Costco, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and the Daily Table. Zipcar It’s very easy to get caught up in the day to day of MIT. Because you are constantly surrounded by such brilliant people, you’ll often start to hold yourself up to incredulous standards. You may think to yourself “Ugh, I’m only doing   instead of an internship” or “I’m only taking single variable calculus when all my friends are taking multivariable calculus.” It’s important to step out of MIT sometimes and realize that the standards we are held to here aren’t at all applicable or realistic for the real world. Make sure to ground yourself by doing quick little sanity checks here and there. I do this best by keeping in touch and maintaining a circle of friends that are non-MIT folks. Just remember that MIT is not the world, and the world is not MIT. And now, just quick tidbits of advice: Lastly: If there’s any place to do it, it’s here at MIT, where diving headfirst into something scary and unknown is not only encouraged, but expected. There will be people to catch you if you fall. Mistakes are welcome. You’re bound to mess up a couple times here at this hell school. Enjoy it while you can. After all, there is truly no place like MIT. Happy first year!

Content warning: mention of suicide, discussion of death. Quotes are taken from  Your Last First Day There Is No Antimemetics Division where are you going? I remember the dozens of  things people told me about MIT I remember the form I had to fill out to accept my offer of admission. People called this “committing” to MIT, and I remember finding it strange that people could commit to a college much like one could commit to a responsibility or a relationship. The word   is from Latin  , which has  evolved meanings I remember going through each stage of this evolution, in much the same way a person goes through the  Kubler-Ross model of grief I remember reading  Although of course you end up becoming yourself hold on to who I thought I was  be changed, and that I   this choice, and that to commit is to “trust oneself completely to”, and that when I committed to MIT I committed to being changed. I remember the form I had to fill out to accept my offer of admission. It’s been too long ago that I know I’m inventing the details, but the memory feels like this: I click the “submit” button. The icon on the browser changes, from the letter M to a spinner. Seconds pass. I see a life flash before my eyes, one of four years spent in MIT, one filled with doubt, depression, and difficult decisions. My cursor moves to the back button, but before I can click, the page loads. To commit is to “bring into danger by an irrevocable preliminary act”, and in those few seconds I had brought the next four years of my life into the unknown. She remembers the dozens of warning signs covering the package; she remembers the three-factor authorisation procedure she had to follow to get into the sealed container where it was stored; she remembers the centimetre-thick book of medical advisory information, which she discarded; and, rolling her left sleeve back, she finds a fresh needle mark with a speck of blood, and remembers administering the injection. Two years after I committed to MIT, or one year ago, I experienced this feeling I called  Wheeler collects these fragments but fails to remember the memory itself. Because: life is only ever experienced in parts. (Why else are our memories like frames on camera film?) Because: life can only ever be explained in retrospect. (Why else can we only tell stories about things after they happen?) Because: life is a series of irrevocable commitments. (Why else do we have regrets?) We, external observers, see Wheeler’s fragments and, in the context of the story, are able to piece together what happened. But can she? During the Activities Midway, which happens near the end of orientation week, the student groups put on a show. The first-year students don’t realize this, but they are being used as the unit of measurement. How many frosh stopped by your booth? How many frosh signed up for your mailing list? To the student groups, the Midway is one of the precious few opportunities to extend the lifespan of their club. To the first-year students, the Midway is a spectacle for the senses. In my first Midway I put my email on every Google Form that caught my fancy. The Assassins Guild had Nerf guns and costumes. The Association of Taiwanese Students had boba. The Student Information Processing Board had a vintage computer. I carried fliers from Live-Action Mafia, the Lab for Chocolate Science and the Fruit Club. I said hi to friends boothing for the Educational Studies Program and the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, and Tech Squares. I wished I brought a bag to fill with all the goodies I’d collected. As I went through MIT, so did the clubs I claimed and clinged to. Some become less active, others more active; some I become less interested in, others more interested in. And the feeling of jumping ship is often like:   or,  At Midway this year I saw a first-year student whom I thought looked liked me. He stopped at the same booths I did, writing his email on every sheet of paper he came across. I saw gray creases under his glasses, saw his eyes fluttering wider every few seconds, in sync with the noise of the Johnson Rink. With the hundreds of student groups in MIT, it’s unlikely he’d pick the same set I did. The dose is taking effect now. Wheeler didn’t read the book because she already knew every word of it. She knows everything that’s about to happen to her. She can already feel her mind hardening, like steel, and the developing symptoms of extreme sensory overload. Last week I dreamt that I was a first-year student at Midway. Every booth I went to was staffed by an older version of me, who’d list all the reasons he loved that group. Whenever I’d stop to look around, more and more tables would appear, filled with more and more people, none of whom I saw the face of. With each conversation with myself, the background noise grew louder and louder. I found it harder and harder to concentrate on my conversations. The noise grew to a crescendo, morphed into an alarm, and woke me up. Counting the Activities Midways during CPW, this is my fourth Midway. This time around I spent most of my time with the Assassins Guild booth, handing passersby Nerf guns and teaching them how to shoot. Four people told me that this was a good method of advertising the Guild. I would know, because people have told me this in the previous Midway, and the one before that, and I told this to people during my Midway. I know everything that’s about to happen, because I’ve read it all before. As I was choosing which classes to take this semester, it felt like I’ve never had to make a decision this hard before. This is blatantly false, because I have chosen my classes for the previous six semesters, and I have made more impactful decisions like  choosing where to go to college choosing between job offers Yet every semester feels like rolling fresh. Somehow the  advice I’ve given before  to   And as I waffle between which classes to take, it felt like I was a frosh again, in wide-eyed wonder that I get to   which classes I can take in the first place, confronted with a dizzying array of choices. “The first thing it did when it saw me,” she explains to her reflection, “was eat everything I knew about the Division. And everything I knew about it. If I had a plan, it ate the plan. …But I’m still me. So I can come up with that plan again. It’s already right in front of me, I just need to see it. If I were me, what would my plan have been?” I’ve managed to choose a set of classes anyway, one that doesn’t break every piece of advice I’ve given. On first glance, as Wheeler points out, it isn’t that surprising. I was the one who gave the advice in the first place, so I could come up with the advice when I need to. But if this was true, then how do people ever change? How do people learn to make decisions differently, if they’d always come up with the same plan? If you wiped my memories of my decisions, I don’t think I’d end up with the same ones. The version of CJ from a year ago might’ve talked to different people in the companies he was choosing to intern between, and might’ve ended up with a different impression of each one. If he made the decision again, it’s a better-than-even chance he would’ve chosen the same way, but it’s not guaranteed. And the first-year version of CJ could’ve skipped a Midway booth for any number of reasons. Maybe there were too many people around it at the time, or he missed it or couldn’t find it, or the person staffing it went on a bathroom break. If he did the Midway, this sleep-deprived frosh, it’s unlikely he’d pick the same set I did. The three-year-old version of CJ didn’t cry much, because he was  conditioned not to When he went to college and  experienced grief for the first time When the pandemic evicted much of the population from campus, his reaction to this was, once again,  not having emotions ” but he doesn’t. He says he tried to make his emotions louder, but couldn’t. He hasn’t realized, not yet, why it was happening. He spent much of his second year working through his emotions. Analyzing each one as it passed, without judging them as right or wrong. He began to  find names for these emotions . Grief for all the time he’s lost: time that he could’ve spent eating with friends, hanging out with friends, staying up with friends. And finally,  , he cries about it. He’s three years old again. He got his toys taken away from him, for the first time, and he cries. He yells about how unfair it all is. He’s a three-year-old inside a college sophomore, again, and he’s experiencing all these new, intense emotions for the first time. He’s a five-year-old inside a college senior, and he’s experiencing all these emotions,  , and it might as well have been his first time. “This is too much,” she says, out loud, willing her heart rate back under control. “I can’t deal with this. I shouldn’t have to deal with this. It’s my fucking first day!” And now he’s  twenty twenty-one twenty-two , yet he has the emotional range of a two-year-old. It might as well have been his first day—he might as well have skipped college—he’d be as anxious and angry and confused and depressed and lost and sad as he is now. All this to say: I’m now twenty-two. I’m now a senior. I’m now older, in many ways. I’ve learned  math, sure web development how to shoot things and hit them how to use a bandsaw how to deal with Boston weather But how do you put a name to the character development I’ve done? What about the spiritual or emotional growth? Can you list “became more emotionally mature” in a resume? What about “became more comfortable with making life decisions”? Or “became less likely to kill themselves”? They’re not things I’ve learned how to  , they’re traits I’ve picked up, a kind of person I’ve  . Each of these changes are meaningful, but there’s something deeper. A more fundamental shift, one that I couldn’t place until recently. “It’s just you, Marion, a division of one! Dying from mnestic overdose, two hundred metres underground, cared for by no one, known to exist to no one, up against an immortal, unkillable idea.” Seeing Wheeler face-to-face with the possibility of dying prompted me to think about death. If there was an immortal idea, it’d be death. If there was a consideration that’d make me rethink  , it’d be death. If there was something I’d think about unreasonably often compared to other people, it’d be death. If I died tomorrow, would I regret anything? Last night I closed my eyes and sat down, for what must have been ten or fifteen minutes, thinking about it. Would I regret not making amends with my family? No. Would I regret not having “done enough good”, whatever that means? No. Would I regret not having kept touch with people? Maybe? It’s not that I’ll regret having  lost friends over the years not spending enough time with them  at accepting this. But I don’t act like it. That’s what I’ll regret the most, I think. Not that I didn’t have enough time with my friends, because I’ll only ever have a limited time with them. Because the amount of time I want to spend with them is infinite, because I can’t   more time to spend. Because one day I’ll die, or they’ll die, or I’ll graduate, or they’ll graduate, or I’ll move on, or they’ll move on. No, what I’ll regret is that I didn’t   of my time with them. That I didn’t spend enough time charting their lives in my head, or spend enough time splaying my life for them, or that I let myself be distracted by trivialities like my problem sets or my phone while we’re together, or that I didn’t compliment them enough, or tell them I love them enough, or hug them enough. Today is my last first day, which means today is my first day. But she knows — someone taught her, she doesn’t remember who — that an Antimemetics Division operative is as good on their first day as they’re ever likely to be. My senior year feels like it’s leading up to this big final exam. The final final exam. It’s written by me, it only has one question, and I get to know what the question is right now:  I’m putting an answer together. It’s still missing parts. I have to figure out where to go to school and for what, or where to go to work and on what. In making these choices, I’ll say goodbye to dozens of friends, experience thousands of emotions, and close the doors to millions of future lives, none which I’ll ever experience. It’s a rough year ahead, but I think I’m ready. I’m as ready as I’m ever likely to be. when will you get there?

You may have noticed that the application for the class entering in 2023 is now live. While some have jumped at the chance to scope out the changes and preview the short answer prompts, a much larger group is likely to wait until the very last minute. While I certainly won’t extol the virtues of procrastination, as long as you meet the deadline, it really doesn’t matter (e.g. has no impact on our decision) when you choose to submit. It is, however, worth noting that If you experience any last minute technical issues, like an unfortunately timed power or internet outage that prevents you from clicking submit before 11:59 PM EST (technically, EDT for EA) ticks away, you will likely have no one to blame but yourself. There are some things about   you complete the application that   adversely impact our review. I have highlighted a handful of my least favorites below. This one never gets old.  I have to commend the ingenuity and innovative spirit that enables applicants to find inventive new ways to complete the application both in ways we did not intend and in ways entirely contrary to our explicit guidance.  While the sheer number of ways that applicants find to not follow directions is impressive, we are not actually impressed by the inability to follow directions.   There are a number of questions that are completely optional for any number of reasons and are clearly labeled. While there is a specific rationale for every question that we ask, not everything is equally applicable for every applicant. If there is something optional that you would prefer not to respond to, feel free to skip it. For everything that you do respond to, we really prefer to have complete information. I know some feel like it may be a hassle to list out all of their high school courses and grades, but we really appreciate it when you do, and really don’t appreciate it when you don’t.  Responding to questions about cultural background by talking exclusively about food or indicating that you don’t have any cultural background probably galls me more than most. Describing ones background as a recipe is not nearly as clever or original as many think it is, particularly when what we are really interested in is insight into the lived experience of applicants and a better understanding of how they navigate the world. Technically, the prompt may have been responded to, but often without providing any information that is actually useful to us.  We want you to be thoughtful and creative, but I, for one, prefer substance over sizzle. Try not to overthink it.  Another classic. It is difficult for me wrap my mind around what someone might actually want to accomplish by complaining about the application on the application. Perhaps it is merely subconscious anxiety bubbling up to the surface, which I can certainly understand. I know the process can be stressful, but if you really need to vent about the process, please send a note or email directly to me.  While that may result in me being aware of who you are for the wrong reason, at least you can avoid subjecting the entire admissions committee to your well-intended, albeit misguided, constructive criticism.  So while this technically falls under the general category of “failure to follow directions,” it really warrants a call-out of its own because of how problematic it is. Last year, we received over 33,000 applications, and far too many included additional supplemental information that we did not ask for.  Most would agree that we already require quite a bit of information, particularly when considering what is asked for on the application, in addition to transcripts, test scores and recommendations.

Hi all! You may have encountered Arcturus, the robo-boat team, at the Activities Midway or on Instagram. Arcturus is revving up recruitment this fall, and to spread the word (and learn more about Arcturus myself), I’m doing a Q&A with the team captain Audrey Chen! All photos by Audrey (@audsphotography).  Yo Audrey hi what’s up! :D  Hi hi hi! Pretty vibey, it’s going!  Let’s start with your elevator pitch for Arcturus — how are you introducing it to incoming frosh?   Arcturus is MIT’s autonomous robotics team! Self-driving robots are becoming a bigger and bigger thing these days, and we’re super stoked to be pushing the forefront of it! This year, we will be building an autonomous boat (also known as an
 
ASV ⁠ 01 Autonomous Surface Vehicle 
AUV ⁠ 02 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Arcturus’ first ASV. Ship Happens, at RoboBoat 2022.  So Arcturus is a pretty new club, yeah? Tell us about its formation!  Yeah! So this will be Arcturus’ second year of competition. Last school year, we competed in RoboBoat 2022, and we’re excited to take on RoboBoat again this year! We’re also building a submarine platform for future competitions and applications! Whether or not we compete in a sub competition this year or the next will depend on the amount of manpower we get during our first round of recruiting.  Who are you most interested in recruiting?  We are looking for all majors and years! From grad students to first-years, we are so excited to welcome people of all backgrounds. I mean, before last year, I didn’t know a single thing about marine robotics or autonomous systems!  We see a particular need for  electrical engineers programmers experienced in autonomy We’re also working on creating a spinoff team,  Arcturus Finance Shameless plug, but if anyone seeing this is interested in joining or learning more about Arcturus (whether you’re an MIT student or not!) feel free to send me an email at  [email protected] ! Team photo from 2021-2022 season! : What was your role(s) in the club last year?   I started out as Business Lead and eventually was elected captain at the turn of the semester. But before I joined, I didn’t actually know anyone on Arcturus, and funnily enough, I wasn’t even all that into marine robotics either. It’s not an exaggeration to say I joined for the vibes and stayed for the people. It’s been a crazy journey pulling together the team — like something from the Avengers hahaha — but I’m so glad we’ve been able to form a community where we can learn and have a good time together.  I’ve enjoyed the vibe every time I hung out with Arcturus. How would you describe the team culture? Any favorite memories?  Because we’re actually not a very large team (compared to Solar Car and MIT Motorsports, which have hundreds of members), we’re really tight knit, so everyone gets to know everyone really closely. Our work-a-hullic nights are stupid, all-night fun ft our classic “gay vibes” playlist on Spotify and plenty of boba.  Ita wearing her many paper boats as a hat We love joking around with each other. Last April Fool’s, a couple people in the lab pranked the rest of us by telling us that they stepped on our lab pet, Turbo the sea snail! They made a little fake Turbo and everything!   Tell me about the competition! How did you feel about it? Goals for next year?  The month leading up to it during the summer, it was a non-stop grind to get everything finished in time for competition. But on our first day at competition, we accidentally switched the polarity on our power source and ended up frying our main computer! It was an absolutely wild experience trying to reconfigure everything to our backup computer, which had an entirely different software setup. But when we got it to work, it was so rewarding! We ended up pulling off 4th in autonomy and 3rd in design, winning $1.5K in prizes. I’m so proud of the team for pulling through even when unexpected mishaps happened though, and I think we learned so much during RoboBoat 2022 that we’re ready to crush it next year. Competition crew at Nathan Benderson Park in Sarasota, Florida for RoboBoat 2022! Competition crew with our prize winnings! My favorite part of the competition, though, was definitely just being able to spend time with the team. I’m so glad I was able to get closer to some of my best friends, who are some of the most brilliant and hardworking people I know. It was a ton of fun, and I still look back on our nightly gator searches and Disney World shenanigans and laugh. Arcturus Team on the Rock N’ Roller at Disney World  To close off, what’s been your favorite thing about Arcturus this past year?  Joining Arcturus has been one of the defining parts of my MIT experience. It’s been a great first season, and I’m really proud of all the work the team has put in. It’s hard enough to build a boat, but it’s even harder to build a community you know will stand the test of time. I owe so much to this team, and meeting everyone has been like finding a second family.  Thanks again for doing this! I’m excited for the build this semester.  Yeah! And we’re always more than happy to have you around! Come by anytime for a boba and a vibe!

in april my friend recommended the excellent article  becoming a magician Not only is any sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic; any sufficiently advanced technologist seems like a magician… Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different. You could not simply scale up my abilities and get Sanatan’s. You would have had to step back and build something completely different altogether. When I speak to Sanatan… I don’t get any closer to a mental model that would allow me to paint like that. It seems to require completely different mental inputs entirely… That, in fact, is my definition of magic – competence so much more advanced than yours with such alien mental models that you cannot predict the outcomes of the model at all. If you asked me to imitate the work of any of the top 20 bodypainters, I could give you a fair imitation, given enough time and access to reference images. With his work I have no idea. then they asked me what i would want to become a magician in, and for a while i wasn’t sure. most technical work doesn’t feel like magic to me – for instance, i’m fluent enough in math and cs that i can more or less understand the workflow of professional mathematicians (other than  ramanujan  i suppose) and software engineers, and i think with some effort i’d be able to understand what goes on in wet labs and mechanical engineering eventually i came up with an answer: some people are very good at reassuring others and inspiring them and making them feel better about themselves. i have only ever been able to do this passively, eg. via being a good listener or leading by example. when i see someone who can consistently do this in a more active manner, through direct words and actions, that to me is magic in february one of my friends was complaining about their social life.  i want to be the kind of person everyone wants to date , they said jokingly. then they followed that up with a more serious statement:  it’s really hard to be noticed, so i want to be the kind of person that everyone notices in a room full of people i agreed with the first part of that sentiment: i find it difficult to get people to pay attention to me in large social settings, particularly because i specialize in two-to-three-person conversations and tend to zone out in significantly larger groups. but on the other hand, i didn’t really like any of the people i knew who were very good at grabbing peoples’ attention; they all felt inauthentic and impersonal, and my interactions with them tended to feel more like entertainment than conversations. as a result i wasn’t sure if the skill of getting peoples’ attention was something i actually wanted to pursue this summer i met a magician. someone who was extremely authentic and down-to-earth in conversation, and also very entertaining and fluent in ways that didn’t compromise on substance or truth. i felt endlessly drawn to their presence, and in large groups i could feel them sparkling and glowing. they shattered my conception of the tradeoffs in social interaction and existed far outside what i thought the realm of possibility was, and for the first time in my life i understood what the narrator of  looking for alaska  must have felt when he said  “if people were rain, i was a drizzle and she was a hurricane” since then i’ve gotten much better at noticing when i encounter a magician in my life. and like i mentioned earlier, almost all the magic i’ve found has been non-academic in nature. that’s part of why i haven’t been as enthusiastic about classes this semester – i am trying to become a magician, and while many mit classes are interesting, at the moment very few of them feel like magic to me (the main exception is 6.2540 nanotechnology: from atoms to systems, which is why i am enrolled in the class) recognizing magic has left me feeling ordinary, dull, unremarkable. i feel a unique flavor of powerlessness in the presence of magicians, and that feeling is incredibly inspiring

This is PUF! I obtained a temporary cat this summer because Ilani A. ‘23 was off at a very cool math REU that, sadly, did not allow cats.
 
PUF ⁠ 01 short for Public Universal Feline For the summer, though, PUF was living with me on 5w in EC, and got to freely wander around the Wood-side lounge and kitchen. PUF spent the summer enjoying a variety of activities such as: 1.   PUF is a loud cat. PUF is also an opinionated cat. PUF also has impressively large lungs for a relatively small cat, and will go   without pause because they want to be fed at 3 am. Or maybe because they want cuddles at 3 am. Or maybe because they’ve decided they want out, also at 3 am. I don’t know if PUF stopped screaming at 3 am or if I just got really good at sleeping through early morning feline protests. 2.  “the m in mcat stands for majestic cat” -raleigh ’26 3.  I taught PUF a “sit” command, but PUF is smart enough to understand that they don’t actually have to do anything just because I told them to do it. PUF only sits if I’ve got a treat in my hand, and then will only do the bare minimum that could be considered “sitting.” Sometimes they do a sad little half-squat and then meow at me resentfully when I don’t consider it enough of a sit. 4.  but most importantly, 5.  in that PUF used to scream at me if I didn’t leave an arm outside of my blankets for them to cuddle with at night, and then they suddenly stopped doing so, and I could not figure out why PUF didn’t like me any more until I started packing everything up to move out of EC and back into Random, which meant I had to move this box that PUF liked to chill on, “Do you think the dildo reminded PUF of Black Hole?” – Grace S. ’23 and on this particular day, I find PUF curled up on it. With a purple dildo. My temporary cat really replaced me with a silicone sex toy. Thanks, PUF. I don’t know whose nor when nor why nor how PUF managed to get this up onto a loft. It didn’t look like it was small enough to be carried around in a cat’s mouth; it definitely wasn’t there when I moved into said room; someone on 5w is now one dildo short because my temporary cat is cuddling with it. I live in horrified amusement at the idea that clearly PUF is capable of carrying this thing around in their mouth, and so there is a distinct possibility that PUF has been hanging out in the lounge  ing at people while carrying their emotional support dildo, but I haven’t really gotten the courage to ask the other summer residents what shenanigans PUF has been up to when I wasn’t watching. 5w, I am so sorry. If you or a loved one have been affected by PUF’s kleptomania, you may be entitled to financial compensation in the form of “me buying a replacement.” For everyone else: fear not, PUF is now safely back on Black Hole! However, they’re so aggressively cuddly every time I visit them that I almost feel a little bad that I left their stolen dildo on 5w. #cats #East Campus #puf the dildo cat #Random Hall #this post used to be about my room

the fourth floor of E52, ⁠ 01 home of the economics department, and the place where I spend most of my time on campus these days Back in April, one of the paper towel dispensers stopped working. Something was wrong with the motor, and when you put your hand in front of it, it’d churn out a piece of paper at about a fifth of the normal rate. https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/test2.mp4 I knew there were things I could easily do about this — call
 
FIX-IT ⁠ 02 a service repair hotline for on-campus buildings It took about a month for it to be fixed. For three straight weekends in June, I went on hikes. My  road trip last summer 5-mile, relatively-flat loop Skyline Trail Previous Next These trips took up a lot (if not all) of my weekends, and so on the surface, it seems like I care a lot about hiking. But I don’t particularly identify as a hiker — so why did I do this all? Well, the first Blue Hills trip was intended as a way of relaxation and meditation; a time to be alone and disconnected, free to just think for a bit with some space away from the world. The second was a bit of a “prove to myself that I can”, given how long/difficult that it was, and also a time to hang out with my roommates. The final trip, I was invited by an economics friend, and I said yes because it seemed fun to explore hikes a bit further away and to hang out with new people in my department. When it comes down to it, I feel like I’ve been going on these hikes just because … I wanted to. And so long as I keep enjoying it, I can see myself continuing to hikes for the rest of my adult life. But there are a few things that have been nagging at me as I start turning hiking into a hobby. First is a feeling of “stagnation” — the feeling that I’m “settling” into habits and hobbies, and not going out and trying new things as much as I used to. It’s a feeling I never had in college, in part because college is defined by new experiences and development and growth. But now that I’m past undergrad, “new” things happen much less frequently, and I’m not feeling great about it. Of course, that isn’t to say that there aren’t virtues of “settling” —  the idea that you can just take activities you enjoy and do them again and again, without a need for always trying to better oneself 
just being happy with where you’re at.  ⁠ 03 i know that I need to introspect about my aversion to doing this. i've always tried to strive for happiness in the present, and it sure seems that finding activities you enjoy and repeatedly do them, aka settling, seems like a pretty good way to achieve that. so why do i dislike settling? Second is feeling like I’m a less interesting person. I feel the same thing whenever I tell people “I boulder now!”, which I always follow up with “The thing that every single 20-something is doing these days…” I say it in jest, but it’s kind of true — it’s a hobby that so many around me have picked up, or tried at least once. In a similar way, hiking feels like a “standard” hobby, and if I bring it up, there’s a good chance that the conversation will be connecting about the specifics of the hobby and shared experiences rather than us learning about   things through each other’s experiences. To be clear, I don’t judge   in this way when they tell me that they like hiking or bouldering or any other “common” hobby — it’s solely an issue with self-image, and I don’t know why I judge myself like this. I’ve been in and out of town during July, and spent most of August moving, and only had one chance to go hiking (back up to New Hampshire for Mount Washington) — but even with this time off, I still haven’t sorted through these feelings completely. As the title of this post suggests, I’ve been thinking a lot about motivation recently. Why I choose to do some things, why I choose to not do other things. There are many theories of motivation in psychology, and because I am no expert in that field, I won’t even  attempt  to explain any of them. But each theory claims to represent some part of human behavior; a framework for understanding why it is that people act the way that they do. I like to try and come up with my own frameworks — perhaps this shows through in some of my previous posts. With motivation, I’ve been categorizing things that motivate me (and things that don’t) with the following
 
table: ⁠ 04 this table shows up as a 3×3 box on desktop browsers. sorry for mobile users i just can't figure out how to fix it for you At the most basic level, we choose to do something whenever the benefits exceed the costs — this grid helps me identify and disentangle what those benefits and costs  . It also provides a bit more nuance than the commonly-stated “internally/externally-motivated” by also factoring in what the root of the motivating factor is. Filling in these boxes for different activities and seeing the commonalities, or what’s missing, has been helpful in understanding myself and what kind of person I am trying to be (consciously and subconsciously). For example, with hiking, some of the reasons that I listed above might fit into the box like so: 
– leaving the MIT/Boston bubble 
– feeling like i can do difficult things To be clear, I’m not trying to claim that this is the best way to look at motivation. There are clear shortcomings: things might not fit easily into these two dichotomies (e.g., leaving the bubble also changes my mentality) and there are important dimensions of motivation that aren’t indicated here (e.g., how long it takes for impacts to happen, whether these are things I’m trying to be/things I’m trying to avoid, the magnitude of impacts, and so on). All frameworks are incomplete and inaccurate representations of the real world; even so, they’re useful because they help put some structure on the messiness that is the real world. At the end of almost every semester at MIT, I’ve finished my exams, packed up all of my items, and felt like I should have spent more time around people. Quoting from a  previous post Life is much, much more than admissions, decisions, or “work” in general. One of my clearest memories at MIT comes from a group discussion the summer after my first year, where we were asked what we’d do with an extra hour in a day. The three first-years in the group, myself included, all said that we’d take more classes, spend more time exploring the academic offerings at MIT. But the two seniors in our group both said they’d spend more time with the people around them, taking in the community and the life around them while they could. Today is the start of my eleventh semester at MIT, and I still haven’t learned my lesson. At the start of this year, I made a list of people that I wanted to talk to more, then proceeded to do essentially no follow-up on that goal, despite knowing that I love being around others, seeing friends more would be great for my mental well-being, and that these are friendships I know I need to work to maintain. Hanging out with friends feels like it falls outside of the framework I mentioned above — it’s something that I know I enjoy, and it’s something that’s so easy to do (even just as low-effort as texting a friend and saying hi!), yet I find myself not prioritizing socializing again and again. And I really don’t know why. On the flip side, there are many things that I’ve found myself prioritizing without actively choosing to do so. Every day this year, I’ve finished the NYT Crossword (and Mini) and Spelling Bee, and have gotten pretty
 
decent ⁠ 05 but not competition-level good, as evidenced by the standings of a Boston crossword tournament I went to with a friend I was lucky enough to get some solos in Fugues songs last year, and when I did, I found myself sitting in front of my computer, recording myself singing, and playing it back to figure out where I could improve. They say that you are your own worst critic, and that was painfully true for this process. Yet, I listened to myself and figured out where I was off-pitch, nasally, or gasping for air, and worked to fix these issues, without   asking me to — it just  . In some ways, this is the opposite of “why is it hard to hang out with friends”. Socializing is an activity I love, and it takes little effort, yet I ended up not doing it at all. Listening to myself sing was a literally cringe-inducing process,   asked me to do it, and yet I found myself singing to dozens of recordings to figure out where to breathe and how to hit those high notes. The “ Occam’s Razor 
I’m not sure if it’s true yet or not — perhaps I will on more reflecting. ⁠ 06 of course, there’s also a more positive spin on the occam’s razor explanation, where i’m just really motivated to be a better singer. this one might be true, too. i really just don’t know Another thing that the framework above misses is making judgments about the “goodness” of different motivating factors. For example, I don’t think very highly of myself when I think about the Occam’s Razor explanation above — I don’t want to be a person who is primarily motivated by  (as opposed to someone who chooses things in pursuit of “what I want to be”). Perhaps these factors shouldn’t be judged at all. In some ways, how much does it matter the motivations, the intention behind these things, if the outcome is good? I’m sure I sounded better as a result of all of my self-critiquing; should I care about the reasons that got me to that good outcome? Or conversely: if the motivations are good, but the outcome is bad, how should we view that? Who knows. I haven’t been blogging. I’ve wanted to. But here we are, 7 months after my last blog post, with nothing to show but this long, rambling blog that doesn’t even talk directly about why I haven’t been blogging. I started drafting this post in June. It is September. As has been  previously mentioned on the blogs Petey The book, with many intertwining stories, discusses life at “elite” schools, substance addiction, capitalism, technology, and much more. In between all of that, there are many interesting quotes on motivation, and I’ve picked out two (no spoilers) that have made me think the most. Quote 1 happens in a conversation describing students at a high school tennis academy, teens who are striving to “make it” and become professional tennis players. ‘But perhaps one does attain this … You become just what you have given your life to be. Not merely very good, but the best […] Leave to one side the talent and work to become best — you are doomed if you do not have also within you some ability to transcend the goal, transcend the success of the best, if you get to there.’ […] ‘Then’, Poutrincourt said, ‘and for the ones who do become the
 
étoiles, ⁠ 07 “stars” in french. the speaker here is quebecois, which also explains the unusual grammatical style […] ‘One, one is that you attain the goal and realize
 
the shocking realization that attaining the goal does not complete or redeem you, does not make everything for your life “OK” as you are, in the culture, educated to assume it will do this, the goal. ⁠ 08 see also: <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/">applying sideways</a> […] ‘Or the other possibility of doom, for the étoiles who attain. They attain the goal, thus, and put as much equal passion into celebrating their attainment as they had put into pursuing the attainment. This is called here the Syndrome of the Endless Party. The celebrity, money, sexual behaviors, drugs and substances. The glitter. They become celebrities instead of players, and because they are celebrities only as long as they feed the culture-of-goal’s hunger for the make-it, the winning, they are doomed, because you cannot both celebrate and suffer, and play is always suffering, just so.’ And a quote from a different character, during a long passage of existential crisis: It now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We are all dying to give our lives away to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately—the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away, utterly. To games or needles, to some other person. Something pathetic about it. A flight-from in the form of a plunging-into. Flight from exactly what? […] To what purpose? I chose to spend a large chunk of my life to IJ: about 5 hours per week of reading from February through July. I’m glad that I read the book; it made me think about interesting things and showed me that I can still commit to difficult tasks. But a part of me still wonders about why I chose to spend dozens of hours on this, rather than anything else. At the end of May, a few thousand MIT 2020 and 2021 graduates came back to campus for make-up graduation! It was boatloads of fun. Previous Next Like a normal graduation ceremony, there were speeches, and they were  . One speech, by Kealoha Wong ’99, Hawaii’s first poet laureate, talked about the meaning of it all. I’ve turned an excerpt into it into paragraph form, but really, Kealoha’s delivery brings so much to this — video of the excerpt is embedded below. (I also   recommend the whole speech. It was fantastic.) Chances are that 200 years from now, hardly anybody remember our name, and the work we did on this planet will have faded. And maybe one or some of you will shift humanity in some meaningful way. And for those of you who do, shoot, make us proud of you. But for the rest of us, we may make some esoteric discovery, or some small contribution to our industries. But most likely, our most significant impact will be in our communities and in our families. Our impact will be felt in the way that we treat others, in the way that we treat ourselves. The humanity that we express during our lives will echo as a singular note in the infinite symphony of the cosmos. And trust me, there will be meaningful friendships and deep laughter along the way. We will experience drama, and sorrow, and tragedy in our days. There will be broken bones, broken contracts, and broken hearts. There’ll be moments of clarity and inspiring art. You will feel both pride and disappointment. You feel times of discontent, and times of disconnect, and times of depression. There’ll be love, and joy, and peak experiences shining brighter than all of your other times trudging through the daily mundane. And I wish for you to live all of your multifaceted human experiences presently and fully. Because soon enough, they will all fade. All of them. Even this MIT experience, as vivid as it was in real life and as high def as it was online, your mind, your memory, your sense of what this was will fade. I have a confession to make. I don’t remember most of what I learned here. [LAUGHTER] You too? OK, cool. Don’t tell my family. They still believe I still got it. But it’s true. I know that at one point I could calculate the IHTFP out of a differential equation. [LAUGHTER] That I could break down with mathematical precision what was going on in a nuclear reactor core. That at some point, I could have told you the difference between Laplace and Fourier transforms. MIT transformed my mind. But let’s say you gave me a pop quiz today in any of that — any of that. Let me retake any one of those exams that I took when I was here. Start the clock for an hour. Heck, make it open-book like how it used to be. You know what would happen? I would look at that first sheet of paper with all those Greek letters and Hindu Arabic numbers on it. And the minutes would continue to tick. I would flip through the pages and I would start to daydream about the people that I knew here, the countless hours that we spent together would flash as a mash-up of greatest hits of late night talks and long walks over and along the Charles. I would try to remember the specific pathways that took through the Infinite Corridor during a typical day to get from Lobby 7, to Building 26, then to Building 4, only to have to circle back through 10, 3, and 7, to end up at Building 5 without ever going outside to expose myself to the Cambridge snow. [LAUGHTER]. I would giggle at the fact that I walked barefoot around campus the first couple of months that I was here because I wasn’t quite yet ready to give up that part of my Hawaii upbringing. I would recall some of the hacks that I witnessed, like the time when folks dressed this dome up as R2D2 a couple of days before Star Wars, The Phantom Menace was released. I would reflect on all of my crushes, and all of my roommates, and the closeness, and the growing pains of our coming of age. I would smile over the friendships that I made. And I would be grateful for the way that MIT changed my brain. And I would turn that test in blank. And from another speech, by Chengzhao “Richard” Zhang PhD ‘21, with some thoughts on motivation, ambition, and success. (I’ve copied most of the speech here). Let me tell you a story right here. Six years ago when I first got to MIT, I looked up on the dome and told myself, I’m going to conquer the world. Just like many of you, my fellow alums, I am and have always been a very ambitious person, driven by the desire to be successful and accomplished. But what is success? Back when I was pursuing my PhD in math at MIT, success for me meant graduation. That definition was emblematic, straightforward, and unanimously agreed upon by my friends, family, and even my worst enemies. [LAUGHTER] So for five years, I worked extremely hard towards my degree just like all of you here. And I still remember the day that I defended my dissertation, Wednesday, April 28, 2021. Actually, right over there in the green pyramid top behind the trees in building two. That’s where I virtually defended. That day I felt so much accomplishment and success. But now that I’ve graduated a year ago, I’ve come to view success on different terms. Or as a mathematician would say, ill-defined and multi-valued. [LAUGHTER] Right after leaving MIT, I still had the same notion of wanting to conquer the world, per se. So I kept on hustling on my new job until I started feeling stuck by the daily mundanities of going– getting up and going to work. And this time? Guess what? There’s no symbolic universally agreed-upon finish line like the dissertation defense or the commencement. And it took me a while to realize the importance of having internal success definitions, a set of your own metrics for what it means for you to be successful. I then celebrate frequently when I succeed on my own terms. And even more than that, I find little joys over the otherwise daily mundanities, whether it be a serendipitous chat with a good friend or finding that perfect meme on Facebook. [LAUGHTER] As we embark on our next journey, whether it be academia, industry, entrepreneurship, or further education, I have no doubt that MIT’s training has enabled us to succeed on our terms and conquer our own world that nobody else can ever define for us. In the meantime, celebrate the small as well as the big wins, such as today’s graduation. Thank you so much. These graduation speeches particularly spoke to me, having just finished up my first year of grad school. I was never fully set on doing an economics PhD, even  when I chose it I still feel very far from having all of the answers For one, I’ve realized that I’m not that ambitious of a person. On a trip with cohort-mates after finishing our first year, I and others judged my ambition to be at about the 10th percentile of my cohort. [As a quick aside, I’d like to talk about the words   and  . For many, ambition and motivation are intrinsically related, but I’d like to distinguish them slightly. Motivation feels like a broad word for a generic “why do you want to do something”; ambition, as I am using it, specifically refers to the desire to succeed in or achieve something, especially things that are difficult and thus require sacrifice of some kind (hard work, time, …). The “10th percentile” bit was actually part of a conversation on economics motivation; but I think that ambition is a more accurate term to describe what we were talking about. I think that I   motivated to do so many things — it’s just that my motivation to do economics at the expense of these other activities is very, very low. (And of course, there are  many other ways to define these words There are things that I know would make me a better economist — practicing research ideation, spending more time reading papers, just having more conversations about economics — but the truth is that I just don’t want to do those things. I’m unwilling to take the time I’m spending on these other areas of my life — hiking, a cappella, reading Infinite Jest, and of course, being around people I care about — and spend more of it on economics. To be clear, it’s not like I’m  not  working; I probably put in at least 40-45 hours each week doing economics, and I’m trying to think about potential research ideas, and I’ve got a research project in the pipeline where I’m trying to get data access, and so on. But as with everything, there is so much  more  that I could be doing, and in particular, I know that I prioritize the “grad student” side of me less than many of my peers. Is there a simple explanation, like I just care less about economics than them? Is my avoidance of (academic) work a self-perception thing, where I don’t want to see myself as a person willing to sacrifice doing things I enjoy for the sake of my career? If I were to spend more time working, I could probably end up being a pretty good economist — why is it that I don’t care about becoming one? Are these my true values, or am I just scared of trying and failing? Why is it that I’m in such a lucky position — an economics graduate student at MIT, goddammit — and not trying to make the most of it? I don’t think that I’d be happy with my life if I tried to be the best economist I could be. But then why, in this world where I choose to value day-to-day happiness more than my research, do I still feel bad about making this choice for myself? As it goes with life (and many of my posts): many questions, and the vaguest inklings at answers. Those answers will only come with more reflection, more conversations with others, and more time — if ever. There is no rush to find those answers. For now, I sit here with these thoughts, just identifying and feeling, and trying to put the puzzle pieces together. #a cappella #grad school #hiking #motivation #research #why?

The other day, my friend sent me photos of herself trying on potential wedding dresses. She recently got engaged to her boyfriend on their third anniversary. I liked looking at the dresses, which were gorgeous, dreamy ball gowns. I liked thinking about her wedding, which is happening next autumn. But it also reminded me that she had met her fiancé months after I’d started dating my ex, Chris, who I was also together with for three years; we broke up this past January. Even though I’m still young in the grand scheme of things, it felt odd to see a couple that had met later than us get engaged already. What happened to my Facebook feed? It feels like no time has passed since we were posting updates like “like my status for a  truth is ” and videos of ourselves  upending a bucket of ice water over our heads . Now, in the past year, at least a dozen engagement and wedding announcements have appeared. Several of my middle school classmates are married now. An acquaintance gave birth several weeks ago.  People are conquering professional milestones, too. Another middle school classmate who graduated early from college recently finished law school. One of my best friends from MIT finished his two-year fellowship in the United Kingdom and started medical school at Stanford. Sometimes I think this was a good life hack; by befriending people my age (which is easier for me to do than befriending older people), but then taking time away from college, I now have a network of people whom I connect well with on a personal level, but who are further along in their careers and thus can offer guidance. But sometimes I’ll see a Linkedin update about someone my age getting a new promotion, moving up in the world, and have a mini-crisis about what the hell I’m doing with my own life. It’s my birthday today. Starting in 2019, I’ve always thrown a birthday party for myself, mostly because my birthday always falls at the start of the school year and it’s a good chance to see everybody before the semester begins to kick our asses. But this year, I wasn’t sure what I would do, because many of my closest friends from MIT are no longer in the area.  Sam has graduated and is working in Wisconsin, Izzy has graduated and is working in California, Jude has graduated and is visiting Norway, Chris H. has graduated and is in graduate school in Georgia, Chris X. has graduated and is in graduate school in California, Tiffany has graduated and is working in New York, Gilbert dropped out and is working in New York, Michelle has graduated and is in graduate school in California, Steven has graduated and is in graduate school in California, Ivy has graduated and is in graduate school in Texas, Agni has graduated and is working in California . . .  Listing all this out, I’m struck not so much by sadness or emptiness but by gratitude, that I had the luck to meet so many amazing people and that we are still friends, even if we don’t see each other on a regular basis.  All my friends scattered to the winds,  isn’t that what Lin-Manuel Miranda said? But I’m not sure that’s the best description, actually. It seems to suggest that my friends are stray leaves adrift in the breeze, caught by forces larger than themselves. To me, they feel more like rockets launching into the air, aiming at different patches of sky. Sometimes, a friend will come back to Boston and ask to meet up. They usually want to know where I’m living now. My answer is always the same. I’ve lived in the same house since September 2018, barring for July 2019 when I was teaching in Jerusalem and March 2020 through September 2021 when the pandemic sank its fingers into the world.  The planet has spun and spun and here I am, standing in the same place. Yesterday, I saw an elderly couple dining  al fresco  at Starbucks, sparrows hopping around near their feet. I watched them watch the birds. It made me happy.  I like small moments. I like sitting in Hayden Library as the raindrops race down the windows. I like debugging my code. I like sending the pleading-face emoji, the one with the big teary eyes. I like amusing myself with my own jokes. I like walking through the Infinite at three a.m., exhausted from finishing up an assignment. I like throwing snowballs indoors. I like everything that cannot be shared on social media, that does not count as a life accomplishment, yet is what has built the life I have. From a poem by Yena Sharma Purmasir:  I wish I invented something./Is it too late? I waited for my life and the bus drove on./The whole sky changed .  Sometimes I get scared that the bus is long gone, but that’s not quite right, is it? I’m the one behind the wheel. I always have been.

This weekend, I moved into a new apartment. This academic year, I’ll be living in Central Square with three roommates – one of us a teacher, the other three getting master’s degrees at MIT. Tomorrow is
 
Registration Day, ⁠ 01 The day before classes start, everyone meets with their advisor to register for classes. Usually, you show up knowing approximately which classes you want to take. You discuss which ones and why with your advisor and then they approve your course selection to officially register you. It feels weird to be doing things for the last time when I already sort of did them for the last time, and this time it’s different. As a master’s student, I can’t live in the
 
undergraduate dorms ⁠ 02 There are graduate dorms you can choose to live in, but I wanted to get a place with my friends :) out of 
a couple ⁠ 03 In EECS, the Master's requires six classes, but a lot of people end up completing some of them during undergrad and carrying them over. I've done 3, so I have 3 to go. 
pays ⁠ 04 Undergrads are paid hourly. The rate is actually very good, starting at Massachusetts minimum wage of $14.25 and often going up to $17 or $18 for teaching jobs. But graduate students get tuition, free health insurance, and a pretty healthy monthly stipend. But I’m still here, in the city I love at the school I love. Come this time next year, I probably won’t be in Cambridge at all. I’ll be working a job somewhere, a job I don’t yet know in a location I don’t yet know. I’ll be moving in to a different apartment in a different city. I certainly won’t be a student on this campus. I will probably
 
never ⁠ 05 unless I decide later to come back for a phd, which I’m not currently planning but isn’t out of the question For the past two decades, my life’s rhythm has been the academic calendar. I love the month of September because it’s the first month of the new year, the month of fresh starts and new beginnings. This September is one of my last fall beginnings: in the adult world, it’s up to you to choose when to take your vacation or start a new job. I may never again feel that great combined joy of a new schedule, an empty notebook, a class that just might change your life (or be really boring, but you don’t know that yet) and seats full of friends you haven’t met yet. Not to say that the adult world has none of this. There are fresh starts, beautiful autumns, new friends and new beginnings. But I’ll have to go looking, and when I find them they assuredly won’t be exactly the same as what I have now. I know when the time comes, I’ll be ready, because I always am. But it’s bittersweet: loving what you had and sorrow for losing it, mingled with excitement and readiness for what comes next. For now, I’ll just try to appreciate where I am. And that’s all I can do. See you for one last year of blogging, my friends.

Don’t tell, but I’ve never written much poetry before. I read poem books, from a tiny copy of  The Rubaiyat  bound in leather, to a weathered e e cummings collection, to W. S. Merwin’s  Shadows of Sirius  found in a little free library while I was living in my van. I wrote a poem here and there, and I read a few of Masha’s from 21W.762: Poetry Workshop. Then Alan sent out invites to join a summer poetry group — summertry, we called it — and I thought, why not? We met on Sundays at 10 pm for me in Denmark, 1 pm for those on the west coast. One poem per week, with different prompts, some as simple as a

paradelles.  ⁠ 03 theoretically one of the hardest forms, see previous note As the summer rushed on, I found myself enjoying poetry. I signed up for Advanced Poetry Workshop this fall, to keep on trying new forms and commit to workshop a new poem each week.  At the end of July, inspired by my friend Sophia W.’s penchant to commit wildly to cool and unexpected things, I thought, what if I wrote one poem for every day of August? This seemed like a foolish and daunting task, but I had time. Denmark was beautiful, and I’d spent the first two months of summer soaking up new experiences.  coffee shop, the walls plastered in posters and record labels I set to it. Often my writing routine would begin with typing up the poem I’d handwritten the previous day, making small edits. Next, I’d look for a form I was eager to try, and scribble a new poem in my notebook. The process took about an hour on good days, longer on slow days. After that, I’d switch gears to fiction work. There are many strengths to poetry, but in particular I love the ability to have something complete and easily digestible after just a few hours of work. Poems are a great way to try out new ideas, or condense existing ones into their most essential parts. Also, control over word choice and rhythm are incredibly useful for fiction of any length, and a major focus of poetry. I figured I’d learn new skills that can be applied to my longer fiction projects in the future. one of my favorite writing haunts after dark In the end, I wrote 25 new poems in August — the last day or so in Copenhagen I spent with my friends, not writing anything, and the first few days in Boston I was too busy catching up on everything but sleep to write. I had a few from earlier in the summer, so I’d say I did about 31 new poems this summer. All told, there was one paradelle, a

I was surprised by this, since my fiction writing has usually been quite steady.  I expected some of the poems to feel like diary entries, because by August 4th, I was running out of ideas. This did kind of happen, but it didn’t feel mundane. I found myself becoming more familiar with different forms. At the end, rather than choosing a form and then looking for a theme that would work, I would approach the work with a theme in mind and search my
 
growing ⁠ 05 like, grew from 1 to at least 5 The first time I wrote a pantoum, a poem where the first and third line of each stanza repeat as the second and fourth line of the following stanza, I thought I despised repetition. By the end, I found I actually quite liked it.  I found myself far more comfortable with free verse poetry, and less constrained forms, like the dictionary definition poem. Rhyme and meter got much easier. I still cheat on syllable counts all the time, but  Often, I found that my poetry was stronger after I cut out a stanza or two, reducing the poem to 75% of its original length. Cutting words in longer fiction used to be the bane of my existence — I’ve since gotten better at it, but even so, seeing that lesson reflected again in poetry was useful. Apparently fantasy / speculative fiction poetry is a thing! I found a few magazines that specifically publish spec poetry, which is lovely to find out. I wrote a few of these and definitely want to read and write more. I wrote some poems on napkins by the canals of Amsterdam One cool experience was when I condensed a 1000-word short story about a vampire into a 14-line rondel, which is a form where 4 lines are repeats of each other. A lot of detail had to be cut, of course, but the core of the story between the flash fiction piece and the poem were the same. Goals for the coming semester: I didn’t try out as many new forms as I’d originally intended, so I’m excited to be pushed to try more forms in class this fall. All told, I learned a lot from this experience, and I’m excited for the work to continue!

There’s always this hum on campus, some whisper of a noise either from the drone of some electrical wire or the whir of a machine or the clings and clangs of construction (because Boston-Cambridge is always under construction, somewhere). Above this noise, you’ll hear chatter from students idly talking about their day or intensely debating about some mathematical concept that goes way above any of our heads. But if you listen close enough, cutting through the chit-chat and the murmurs of the machines, you’ll hear it. Feel it, even. A tiny, rhythmic pulse that permeates the air, almost electric in nature. It was one of the first things I noticed about MIT–that underlying, unshakable   that echoed in my bones. As I looked around, I saw others marching along, consciously or otherwise, to it. That rhythm was their driver and catalyst, filling them with a determination and vigor I’ve never quite seen before. Each step they took was purposeful, calculated, as they walked and walked to wherever they had to go. Tentatively, I took a step. And another. And another. There were times where I felt the thrum of it all was too difficult to follow, too hard to keep in time with. Erratic. Flighty. I stumbled as I walked, tripping over my feet a couple of times. In a panic, I looked around. Had anyone noticed? Had anyone seen my misstep? But there they went; they paid no attention to my faults in rhythm or my mistimed pace. Like clockwork or wound up toy soldiers, they continued their stride, exuding a confidence and sureness that my 17-year-old self, let alone any 17 year old, didn’t quite possess yet. Three years later, I find myself once again back on the MIT grounds. I’m unsure of when the phrase “I’m going back to MIT” slipped into “I’m going back home”, but as I walked on Mass Ave, waves of familiarity and warmth washed over me. These were pathways I’ve walked thousands of times. Halls I could walk blindfolded. Buildings I could call mine. As I continued, the once foreign electric thump of the ground was now a welcome hum under my feet. Before, it was something incomprehensible, something I had to chase. Now, it’s omnipresent; I no longer stumble or lose my way, or doubt the path I walk. My feet walk for me, as if the schoolgrounds themselves were showing me the way. I look around and see  wide-eyed students take in the sights and smells for the first time. Shock paints their face because I know they can feel it. The hum. The drum. The beat. Campus is alive. It shakes and groans under the buildings, breathes passion and life into everyone and everything it touches, imbues us with an electricity and vibrancy that only MIT can bring. I’ve gone searching for this hum everywhere I go. In my friends, in my workplace, in my hometown. When I finally feel close, like it’s finally in my grasp, like I finally understand what makes me tick, the feeling leaves almost as quickly as it arrived. Is it possible to miss something before it’s even gone? To mourn something before it’s even passed? The calendar and clock on my wall mock me, constant reminders of the inevitable passage of time. There will come the day when I’m no longer at MIT and the ground underneath my feet is quiet, and that day fast approaches. But in the meantime, I walk onward, keeping the pulse of the campus, able to note each peculiarity: how it quickens down dorm row, how it slows in Hayden, how it skips and stutters in EC. Each step isn’t purposeful, or calculated–I’m simply just walking. The rhythm doesn’t drive me, isn’t forceful by nature, but just acts a suggestion, a guide. I continue on, not in any particular direction or any destination, just wherever I feel like. And I walk on, with as much confidence and sureness the average 20-year-old can muster. Steadily, I continue, determined. About what? I’m not quite sure yet, but it’s there and I follow it. . Campus is alive.

This summer, I worked for fourteen weeks as a software engineering intern at a start-up that focuses on artificial intelligence and data science. My team was focused on AI-powered audio-to-text transcription. Now that my internship is wrapping up tomorrow, I’m reflecting on what I learned this summer and what it means for me going forward: Of course, most people are not in a position where they can’t care about compensation. And to be honest, a large part of why I chose my company this summer was because it paid the highest out of all my offers, plus it was in the Cambridge, MA area so I could live at my current place for a very low cost. I had my upcoming school year’s tuition looming over my head, so I had to make financially sound decisions. But it’s also not something I want to center my career choices around, because money seems to obfuscate what’s actually interesting or valuable for my own learning and growth. Less abstractly, what I mean is, if I weigh compensation as a heavy factor in choosing what to do next, I may end up missing out on less lucrative opportunities that would’ve been more meaningful in perhaps intangible ways. I’ve been applying to internships for next summer, and to be honest, I would love to do something   somewhere that is fast-paced and making important strides in a high-impact field. Before this summer, I thought a lot of AI-based start-ups were overhyped; this belief was fueled partially by my ex-boyfriend’s bad experience at a company that claimed to use AI for drug discovery, but seemed to actually do nothing. I still believe a lot of AI-based start-ups are overhyped, but I also think this industry is very promising and can eliminate a lot of tasks that are currently tedious and unpleasant for humans to complete (such as audio transcription, which is what I worked on). Of course, I don’t want people to lose their jobs in a society that requires everyone to be employed in order to survive, and I’m no expert in economics or political science so I have no idea how complicated it would be for our country to adjust if many current jobs were eliminated by automation. But on a fundamental, gut-instinct level, I like that fewer human hours would be wasted on menial labor.  Suddenly, it was August, and even that slipped away in a moment in time just like Taylor Swift said. I’ve known this before, but this summer reminded me again that working a full-time job can make the days seem like weeks but the weeks seem like days. I’m scared of complacency, and I’m aware of my own tendency to become complacent: often, when I’m working a full-time job, I feel happy enough just doing the 9 – 5 and then letting the rest of my time fall into the ether. (And when I say ether, I mean the void where everything disappears, not the cryptocurrency. This is not a crypto shill account.) But now it’s September 1st and I haven’t finished drafting a new novel or learned differential equations or painted my bedroom walls. If I’m not intentional and proactive, how I spend my days will become how I spend my life. I like being obsessed, and the ultimate problem with most jobs I’ve had is that . . . they are just jobs to me. I put in the requisite hours and then I have money in my bank account. But I never reach any particularly fulfilling zeniths and my work doesn’t seem to ultimately matter; it seems difficult to become invested when I’m only an intern and don’t have any true ownership over a project. My dream job is one where I get to do interesting, intellectually stimulating things with people I like and then I work for ten hours straight every day. But I suspect that such a job isn’t the kind that I’d be able to apply for on Linkedin. My company had lots of nice perks, like free lunch on Tuesdays and a gym in the office. They took us on fun outings, such as canoe racing down the Charles river. Obviously, I like getting free stuff, but also I could never forget that what I truly want is freedom: the freedom to enjoy this one life to the fullest, to be surrounded by people I love dearly, to learn as much as I can and take pride in my achievements. Material perks distract me from what’s important. Years ago, one friend who interned at Dropbox once described this moment where he was biking with his coworkers and suddenly had a vision of him at age thirty, still at Dropbox, being injected by dopamine every few hours by his manager. If I were trying to optimize for happiness, I don’t know if I can argue that it is so bad to be injected by dopamine every few hours (since what is happiness anyway besides some chemicals in our brain), but I think I’ve often tried to optimize for interestingness instead, and such a future is certainly not that interesting to me. I thought the culture at my company was cute and nerdy, and people were nice. Still, it didn’t quite stir up the spark of wonder that MIT offers. Much thanks to my company for taking a chance on me; here’s to the upcoming school year and the next recruiting cycle.

I’m spending the day meeting with my  first-year advisees housing is assigned According , is a four day experience for first year students to explore MIT dorms and find their future home on campus. For those of you who haven’t already decided where you’re going to live, REX is the perfect time to explore MIT’s dorms and pick the place where you fit in best with the culture and residents. For the rest of you, REX is a great opportunity to find out about the different parts of campus that you otherwise might not experience. Most of all, REX is a time to enjoy yourself, meet as many people as possible, first years and upperclassmen, and get a feel for everything MIT has to offer. Historically, the guide to REX, which features ~350 events over ~6 days, was published in the  Tech (se e  2015 2014 2013 online I’ve embedded a PDF below if you want to idly flip through it. Hopefully some of the bloggers will post some pictures from their dorm’s REX events soon! Also, MIT released an appreciation video about how various staff around campus prepare it for the return of students, and I wanted to share it ahead of Labor Day: #REX

I spent the summer doing a software internship in New York. I lived alone and spent a lot of time with myself, and as  others mentioned 
I hate living alone, ⁠ 01 The short version is, I really like having someone else in the house with me, even if we’re just sitting there not talking, because it makes the house feel alive. On my own, I feel dead and lifeless. The view from my window at dusk. I like knowing all those glowing windows are people living their lives just like me. I honestly didn’t expect to love New York as much as I did, even though the city is so hyped up. The reasons other people seemed to have for loving NYC, like its nightlife and its theater scene, weren’t things that particularly appealed to me. And although I’ve actually expanded my horizons and enjoyed both of those this summer, it turns out that there are other, quieter day-to-day reasons I love living in New York. Mostly, it’s a city absolutely chock full of people, and I’ve realized I love people.  Before you @ me for eavesdropping, let me assure you, it is completely impossible to avoid this at New York’s level of density. And since I can’t avoid it, I might as well enjoy it. I love overhearing little snippets as people pass by me in the opposite direction, knowing that although what I heard is just a tiny unsolved mystery for me, for someone else it’s a complex and rich part of their life. Choice quotes include:  poly?” B: “No, they’re just–“  her about the divorce, but instead she said–“  Man, I never thought Boston was boring until I saw what New Yorkers wear. People walk by in the absolute wildest shit and no one bats an eye. But even beyond the truly weird, I just like seeing what average people are wearing. With so many more people walking by all the time, I started to notice fashion in a way I never did before. I can tell you that in July in the Lower East Side, asymmetric tank tops with thick straps were really in, but in August, asymmetric tank tops with thin straps started to take over. Crop tops that come to a point over the belly button only seem to be growing in popularity. And although I’m not certain, I think leg warmers might be making a comeback as August wanes into September. I love keeping a little tally in my mind, adjusting my predictions as I spot more outfits, and playing games with myself:  I found this on the street! I lived near the NYU dorms and let me tell you, you see some crazy stuff. Lots of furniture, for sure (I snagged a beautiful end table off the street myself and I’m still very proud of it), but also a lot of giant — like, larger than human sized — art canvases. And four-foot-tall plants. And a dozen extra long pool noodles. What’s the story with those? I’ll never know, but it sure makes my day to know there is one. One time, I was walking through a subway station behind a guy with one of said four-foot-tall plants. The plant had bright pink flowers at the top, but only a few. A mom and her child were walking in the other direction. The kid was maybe three or four and she stopped, totally transfixed, to stare at the flowers. I watched the man, without even saying anything, pluck off a flower, bend down, and hand it to the girl. It’s pretty hard to have a bad day after seeing that.  Especially in the summer, people were out everywhere and all the time. Picnicking in the park with their friends or family, sitting around a patio table chatting with their food long finished, setting up a folding table in the tiny green space in front of their walk-ups and playing music together. People say New York is “the city that never sleeps”, and that’s
 
definitely true, ⁠ 02 I always felt safe walking home after midnight, because there were so many people still out chatting on restaurant and bar patios.  New York has an amazing subway system, which I love, but more than that, it’s also very walkable. I don’t need the subway to get groceries, or go shopping, or even go somewhere really specific like a luggage store or a locksmith — all of these things were within a 15 minute walk of my house, and usually three or four different versions of each one. Besides being extremely freaking convenient, this creates such a sense of community, especially combined with my last point about people hanging out outside. More than once this summer, I stumbled onto a street festival while just out and about: once a huge one spanning ten blocks, and several times a tiny one, just one little block, a couple dozen chairs, and a band. When I would sit and read late into the night in the park next to my house (it was directly at the end of my block and just one of three within a 15 minute walk!), invariably someone would bring out a guitar and start playing a song. The Lower East Side felt like a place you could live, meet friends, start a community, call home. I’m writing this blog as a break from packing up my apartment, and tomorrow morning I’ll load the car and drive back to Boston. I can’t wait to get back to the people and the campus that I love — I’ve been counting down the days. But at the same time, I’m really going to miss this other place I’ve grown to love and call home. A long time ago, in another world, I was musing on the fact that MIT had come to be home to me just as Toronto was, and I  wrote #New York City

This summer, I took an art class through the Student Art Association at MIT. These classes aren’t for credit and if you’re an undergraduate student, you can become an Art Scholar and receive a scholarship for a class. (I keep putting off my Art Scholar application, so alas, I did not have a scholarship.) I missed drawing. I used to draw a lot as a kid; I got in trouble a few times for doodling on my desk. But during my time in college, I never took a visual arts class, despite looking through the Harvard and Mass Art catalogues several times. I guess there was so much else to learn. But in the last year or so, the old dream of doing a picture book or a graphic novel or something in that nature started prickling in the back of my mind again. When I was in middle school, I wanted to make my own manga. A few years ago, I took CMS.301, Critical Worldbuilding, and my final project had been a comic strip. It was only a few pages, but it still took 60 hours to make. I felt like being a writer and an MIT student concurrently was doable, but I didn’t think an extensive project like a graphic novel was doable during school. Still, I had time this summer, and I was in Cambridge. So I signed up for Alternative Explorations of Drawing (Advanced), even though I wasn’t sure how (Advanced) I actually was. Our instruction, Timmy, was fantastic. He led several workshops in creating different marks using our supplies, which offered me a new perspective on what it means to put something down on the page. It turned out he likes coding, too, and he showed us some of his computer-generated artistic creations which were really cool. At the beginning, I actually got pretty anxious glancing around at other people’s easels and realizing that my classmates were better than me. It’s not like I ever thought I was a professional artist, but I was hit with the familiar panic of  ?? which I’ve often felt at MIT. Then I reminded myself that this is supposed to be an art class for fun and nobody else was actually judging me for being bad at drawing (and even if they were, it didn’t matter). One of the suggested art supplies to purchase was a small sketchbook for daily use. I didn’t end up using it much, but here’s a water bottle I drew one morning. it had a poland springs logo too but that was too difficult to draw One of our first tasks was to draw a display of white ceramic vessels, but with only an eraser This meant we had to cover our entire paper in charcoal, then tease out the shapes by using an eraser. the bar at the top is a spectrum from light to dark we were asked to make For our first extensive assignment, Timmy asked us to do a self-portrait, but he encouraged us to use creativity to do some kind of abstraction. Here’s the photo I used as a reference: little-known fact about me: my hair is naturally wavy! i often flat-iron it I also was inspired by a racist, sexist meme apparently created by incels, which relies on dangerous tropes surrounding East Asian women and their supposed docility. I don’t want to sully MIT Admissions with the image, but if you’d like to see it, it’s  here This is the finished portrait: my friend described this as “rona, yassified” For our final project, we had the freedom to draw whatever we wanted. I stared at the blank piece of bristol paper and thought about what’s been on my mind lately.  , I thought. The linearity of time, capitalism, a sentence I read recently about how time is like a dove flitting outside a car window and if you don’t reach out to catch it, somebody else will. As a child, my mother always yelled, “抓緊!” to me, which literally translates to  but which she meant as,  . So I ended up drawing the following: the pose is inspired by Michelangelo’s Pietà, which depicts Mary holding Jesus after the Crucifixion This one is my favorite. This class reminded me of how much joy there is in the process of artmaking. I loved using my hands: rubbing charcoal dust into the paper, scrubbing a surface with an eraser, this conversation between me and whatever’s in front of me. I wish I had more of that at MIT. If you’re interested in taking a class with the SAA, f all courses are open for sign-ups soon

I have a confession to make, which is that I’ve started this post at least five times in the past few months, but never gotten around to finishing it. Every time I’ve started it, I’ve gotten caught up in this overwhelming sense that I need to talk about all the difficulties of spring semester in order to present you an honest picture of life at MIT. There is no real way, however, for me to talk you through   spring semester was without getting into very detailed specifics about my personal life, and I can’t really do that for a whole host of reasons. So, I start the post, I write a few sentences, and then within a day or two, I decide to trash it and delete it permanently, and move on with my life. The reason I keep coming back to this blog post, however, is that even in the corners of otherwise miserable semesters, there can be spots of joy. I had a lot of new feelings and experiences during my spring semester, and it always feels like a pity that I have all these little stories stocked up on the shelf with nowhere to go. So, although the storm which surrounds them cannot be tamed into a coherent narrative,
 
here are a few of those stories. ⁠ 01 some author's notes: this is probably a combination of every blog I would've written during the semester, if I'd had time, so it's pretty long; feel free to skip to the sections you find interesting. also, because I've already trashed so many drafts of this post, I'm scared that if I spend too much time editing it, I'll trash it again, so it's probably less well-put-together or well-edited than other posts. sorry! I entered MIT intending to be a double major in
 
Course 21W ⁠ 02 writing! 
18C. ⁠ 03 18 is mathematics; 18C is mathematics with computer science. 
6-3 ⁠ 04 computer science and engineering a joint program that allows you to combine any humanities field with any sciences field This was the plan for two years, starting from freshman spring. Every semester, I would register for some classes in 18, some classes in 21W, and some classes in 6, and slowly, but surely, I was working towards completing my degrees. So, this spring, I registered for a math seminar, one of the higher-level math courses which also happens to satisfy one of MIT’s communication requirements. This particular class, 18.704, was a seminar in algebra, and our topic for the semester was “Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups.” This set of words
 
probably means very little to you, ⁠ 05 and if it does mean something to you, I am sorry for what I am about to say next. 
18.701 ⁠ 06 (abstract) algebra I I had experienced an inkling of this feeling in previous math courses, but I had always found some attribute to appreciate in those cases, in spite of the abstractness.
 
18.100B ⁠ 07 real analysis only because it satisfied a major requirement So, for the first time at MIT, after a particularly long Saturday, I dropped the class. I had gone five semesters without having dropped a class, and I had finally done it, and I didn’t feel happy, but I was, at the very least, relieved. I had created  some room for me to breathe The question remained whether or not I wanted to continue with the math part of my degree. At the very least, I knew 18.704 was not for me, but part of me wanted to keep going, wanted to stick to this path which I’d been walking for two-and-a-half years.  Maybe this class just wasn’t for me; maybe some other class might be better. In order to further investigate the answer to this question, I decided to look at the classes which remained in my future, and to pick out the ones I was   excited about. 21W.740, Writing Autobiography and Biography.
 
6.5900, ⁠ 08 nobody has blogged about this yet, as far as I'm aware, but they're renumbering all the Course 6 classes. this class was formerly known as 6.823. 
6.5831, ⁠ 09 the class formerly known as 6.814 or 6.830. So, finally joining a long tradition of people
 
reconsidering their majors, ⁠ 10 during this process, I did briefly consider switching to 21S with 7 (Biology), which is consistent with everybody else's existential crises about their majors. 
became a pure 21W major. ⁠ 11 I actually haven't filed the forms for doing this yet because of <em>reasons</em>. I...should get on that. There are people who love math, and I don’t begrudge them. Doing mathematics for mathematics’ sake is perhaps just as reasonable as doing art for art’s sake. I think I have come to terms, however, with the fact that I am not that kind of person, or, perhaps, I am not the same person I was when I declared 21S, all those semesters ago. Either way, I suppose, that is fine.

its truly incredible 2019 i3 video, ⁠ 13 I have gone on a mission to watch every Next House i3 video available, and one day I will write a blog post about it—but that day is not today. a parody of “Thank U, Next.” Before Next Act, I hadn’t been in a musical since my sixth grade music class, where I played King Arthur in

Fifteen minutes of my life well-spent. A few days later, I learned that, only thirteen people had auditioned, and there were thirteen named roles in the show. It turns out that the easiest way to get me to do something is to convince me that I am either somehow needed or that I am the best person to do the job. This is one of those sort of hubristic character traits of mine that probably deserves a little more self-reflection, but, alas, this is not that kind of blog post. I went to callbacks, and I got a part. Thus began the

Next Exec ⁠ 20 the board that governs Next House Going into the semester, I conceptualized both positions as consisting of two distinct tasks: one was to run efficient meetings and rehearsals, while the other was to plan an achievable timeline for what needed to be done when, and by whom. I felt pretty confident about the timelines part of the job, having  run nREXt managed heavy workloads The one thing which terrified me was running meetings. I’ve never been a very outspoken person, and being “in charge,” in whatever sense that meant, seemed like a mortifying ordeal. Being able to guide a group through a meeting or a rehearsal while also providing space for people to express their own thoughts and feelings and to have some amount of   seemed like an extremely difficult task, and not one suited to a socially anxious person like me. I had to do it, though, and so I did. Every week, we had an Asymptones rehearsal and a Next Exec meeting, and, every week, I would go in terrified and emerge feeling that it had mostly gone okay. Through these   rehearsals and meetings, the semester itself ended up going pretty well. In both cases, the things that needed to be done got done. The Asymptones performed at the CPW acapella concert and put on a spring concert, complete with skits. Next House had its first CPW since 2019, ran an upperclassmen housing lottery, had some social events, and we made sure the house didn’t fall down, which was great! On the surface, everything went fine. I was satisfied with our performance in a difficult semester and through
 
some serious challenges. ⁠ 21 read: COVID. Despite this, I am still not sure whether I am doing a good job in either of these positions. In both cases, there were additional tasks that could have been completed, improvements that could have been made, and I wonder whether being more on top of things would’ve allowed us to function more efficiently, or if we are simply constrained by all of our busy schedules. I am still terrified of running meetings, still unsure about how to create an atmosphere where everybody feels welcome to contribute and excited to engage, still scared of making decisions that do not adequately balance people’s interests.  How do we make sure people are excited to learn their music? How do I make sure that everybody feels heard at an Exec meeting, and that when I ask a question, it is not greeted by silence? I’d like to be able to say that I have grown a lot as a leader in the last semester, but I’m not sure that I have. I think that I have gotten better at running things, or that I have gotten slightly more comfortable leading meetings and rehearsals, but I am not sure where those changes have come from, or the extent to which they are significant. And, although I know that the perfect is the enemy of the good, I also can’t help but continue to evaluate whether the small negative parts of this semester could have been resolved by better leadership, and, conversely, whether the successes of this semester had anything to do with my leadership at all. All of these questions are uncertainties wrapped in uncertainties, and I am not sure if they can ever be answered, but part of me also believes that evaluating them is part of the way to become a better leader. That, too, could be wrong. The only thing which I am confident about is that I am glad to have spent time actively serving these two communities which have meant a lot to me during my time at MIT, and I am glad to feel that I have grown at least a little. I’ll be continuing these positions in the fall, and picking up a new one, in the form of the

One particularly famous tag is  the one at the end of the Ringmasters’ Notre Dame medley 
quite the technical chops ⁠ 25 no, I cannot hold an A4 for twenty seconds; I can barely do nine or ten There’s not much more to say about this, except for that I think it’s pretty fantastic to be able to make music together in the middle of your living group, just a few feet away from your room, and I was glad to be doing more of it spontaneously. We’re not perfect—heck, we’re not even  , really—but we’re having a lot of fun, and that is what matters. I had a few writing projects come to fruition this semester! In my playwriting class, I wrote a third draft of the play I had  spent all of last semester working on Previous Next This was the first time   I’d written had been performed in public, and I was terrified, but I was also excited to have it out there, and to be known, in some sense. Perhaps unadvisedly, I sent an invitation to my entire dorm mailing list, hoping that I’d get at least a few people to come and see the thing I’d made. The director, stage manager, actors, and I went through just three hours of rehearsal in the afternoon, from 4 PM to 7 PM, and then, after a quick dinner, the public performance began at 8 PM. For fifty-five minutes, we sat in the dark, and watched a story that I had written unfold.  is not an easy play to watch. The characters are realistic, but awkward, and they are incredibly good at making bad decisions. It is an especially difficult play to watch when you are not quite sure if the people in the room are cringing because of the characters’ choices, or if they are cringing because the writing is bad. By the time my nerves died down and I was finally able to just sit and enjoy the play, it had already gotten to the most gut-wrenching part, which proceeded to emotionally destroy me, as usual. I felt very uncertain up until the very last line of the play. I knew that I had put together a story which had made me feel a lot of things, but I was completely unsure if it had the same effect on the audience. After the play ended, however, lots of people—from close friends to distant acquaintances—came down and told me that they’d enjoyed the play, or that they’d cried watching it, or, in one case, that it had felt like a “personal attack.” There were hugs, and flowers, and, for the first time, I felt happy about a piece of fiction I had written. There were still changes to be made—pacing to be altered, scenes to be re-written—but, at the core, I had produced a piece of work that was worth something, and that was a new and rare feeling. I also took 21W.771, Advanced Poetry Workshop, this semester, which was a little bit of a different endeavor, although no less enjoyable. Every week, everyone would bring in a poem, and, in turn, each person would read their poem aloud, and we would all respond to the poems aloud. We went through forms in turn—the aubade,
 
the pantoum, ⁠ 26 a form I struggled with so much I wrote five and still liked none of them I have always liked poetry and the way it can take a reader by the hand and twirl them around, and this semester, I finally
 
started to feel like I could do that too. ⁠ 27 in order to capitalize on this feeling, I ran a twelve-week ten-poem poetry workshop this summer with some MIT friends, and, although we had our ups and downs, I am very glad it happened, and I have some good poems to show for it—but maybe more on that later. I suppose that it should not be surprising that someone studying writing would slowly get better at it, or that they might get happier with their writing over time. I am, however, still surprised and overjoyed that it has happened to me in particular, and that it seems to be well-received by others as well—not because that is the primary goal, but rather because part of writing is being able to precisely communicate a feeling to someone else, and I am glad that I am finally starting to achieve that. There is still much work to be done, and much to be learned, but, at the very least, this feels like a big step in the right direction. I think one of the most important things about MIT is that there are genuinely so many ways to be happy, but if you try to do all of them at once, you will probably be very sad. I did a lot of new things in the spring, and they were all good for me in different ways, but I do sometimes wonder if I could’ve been better off doing less. After all,  I’ve found a lot of joy in the relaxed freedom of this summer. On the other hand, while working on this post, I found a note in  a journal entry The question occurs: is this what you want to be doing with your one wild and precious life? Somehow, it seems, the answer is yes. Maybe I shouldn’t be so surprised by the lack of regret, but it is an interesting belief to note. I am so tired, and everything is so stressful, but at least I’m happy enough. I’m still not entirely sure where the balance lies; I am always pulled towards the option of doing more things, taking on more responsibilities, getting busier and busier and busier. Maybe it will be okay, regardless; maybe, as long as I genuinely care about the things I am doing, and I am not so overwhelmed that I am losing sleep or losing friends, I will be  . Only time will tell. In the meantime, I’ll make sure to keep trying new things.

Last fall, I took STS.S20, Tales of Two Parallels: East Campus History. It’s a special class, offered for the first time this year, with the purpose of documenting East Campus culture and history before the dorm is renovated. The class, now labelled STS.051, will be offered this fall, and I want to encourage people to take it! The coaster we’re in the process of building this fall!! What surprised me about this class was that it isn’t the sort of lecture-based history course you encounter in high school and early years of college. It’s not a seminar, either, where you do readings and discuss during class. We did have lectures, many guest lecturers, and readings; however, the main focus of the class was research. We learned how to collect oral histories (read: interviews), access the MIT Archives, and got a crash course on art history and documenting murals — and we learned all that by doing it. There was a great emphasis on reaching out directly to alumni to gain an understanding of East Campus in days of yore. We produced a lot of interviews and documents about East Campus history — and even a minecraft rendition of the parallels, including every mural! This being a class about East Campus, there were many, many fun anecdotes. As the roster was restricted to East Campus residents, the class felt friendly and close. Those who didn’t already know each other by sight or name were quick to meet. I came in fresh from REX and already recognized a wide swath of people. This class was particularly interesting to me as a (then) prospective History double major. I came in expecting a lecture-based class, where I could sit with my friends and hear funny stories about people racing around the fifth-story ledges and setting cars on fire. The hands-on research came as a total surprise, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I appreciate the well-aged humor in letters staff sent one another back in the 1970’s, now kept in the Archives for future undergrads to judge. We met so many alumns. My interviewee was a total badass, both now and when she attended MIT in 1972. However, being a History major or minor is not at all necessary to enjoy this class. I am to my knowledge the only History student — many people took it to fill the H of the HASS requirement, or were drawn by the
 
9 units ⁠ 01 most MIT classes are 12 units; however, this class had a comparable amount of work to my other history classes. I asked some classmates for their takeaways, too. Here’s a review by Anhad S. ‘25: This was my favorite history class. I loved learning about the history of East Campus, especially because I interact directly with the result of this history every day. If you take the current pranks, events and general tomfoolery that EC residents get up to and extrapolate them over almost 100 years, there is so much interesting stuff to discover. Interviewing cruft was really eye opening, as I saw myself in their stories, interacting with the same culture I know and love today.  One of my favorite stories was from an interview my group did, about how water wars used to take place inside the building. Slugfest (4E) found a heavy optical table (called the “Third-Easterator”), which would vibrate at the resonant frequency of the east parallel when they dragged it down the hall. This allowed them to make a tremendous amount of noise from above on Tetazoo (3E). So, in response, Tetazoo would pressurize fire extinguishers full of water and invade slugfest, hoping to steal the Third-Easterator or get soaked trying. Inevitably Slugfest would barricade their doors and prepare fire extinguishers of their own, so that by the time the Tetazoan fought their way onto hall, the Third-Easterator could disappear into someone’s room. Now the concept of spraying water at each other *indoors* seems outrageous, but such water-fire extinguisher fights used to be a regular occurrence. This is why, when carpets were going to be installed in the halls in a past renovation, students specifically requested them to be “outdoor-rated”. I also got to learn the origin of many aspects of EC culture, such as the Tetazoo squanch mascot, or how the IPP (important putz poll) spread to EC discuss.  Keep an eye out for this class, and say hi to your local cruft!

campus feels alive again. frosh spilling into dorms, catching up with hallmates in the lounges, the  ec rush playlist “what did you do this summer?” i spent these three months on a languid journey of self-discovery, mostly. i did a lot of cooking, a lot of romanticizing, a lot of
 
reading ⁠ 01 my list: all about love by bell hooks, crying in hmart by michelle zauner, detransition, baby by torrey peters, stone butch blues by leslie feinberg i picked up journaling again. i’ve had the same le petit prince moleskine notebook since the beginning of junior year of high school, and now, going into my junior year of college, i’m almost done. it took me long enough. four years is a lot of time to change a person; reading my entries from august 2018, i can’t help but cringe at the unnecessarily harsh ways i interacted with the world. i think it’s borne from the wild confusion of being 16 years old, bemoaning perceived injustices to me everywhere and lashing out to try and blame it all on something, anything — but at 20, i’ve learned that staying kind is far more productive to myself in the long run. i started reading ask polly articles and subscribed to the author’s  substack vulnerability because as we’ve all heard by now, being vulnerable doesn’t make you weak. it makes you stronger. sometimes, this sounds like a canned statement, but it couldn’t ring truer for me. i wallowed for much of sophomore year, hardening my shell and building my walls up because it dulled the pain, but choosing to take a leap of faith and  open my heart again i asked my therapist if we could switch to weekly sessions for the summer, and i think that has been very helpful for me. it turns out that being honest with your therapist actually helps you solve problems, which is crazy. being honest with yourself, too. i’d say i’m a very self-aware sort of person, where i tend to know exactly what’s wrong with me. but   things is different from   my emotions and it’s very different from   and   problems. it’s like — i can journal all i want about what i’m feeling and how that makes me a flawed person or whatever, but if i don’t take any steps to change that, even in a small way, then i’ll be stuck. and so i’ve started taking baby steps. i’ve sent out urop emails so i can find a place before the direct funding deadline, and i’ve been lucky with the responses i’ve gotten. i applied to a student group i’ve always admired, and during the interview they somehow ended up taking me to the new mccormick basement gym and i showed them my dorm and my cat. (i think it went well.) i’ve started consistently going to the gym for the first time. before, i was nervous about it because i had no idea how to use any of the equipment or what to do and i also hated the idea of anyone watching me work out because then they’d have to watch me be confused and not immediately perfect at everything. but apparently the trick is finding a gym buddy. i’ve been going with chris, who actually works out regularly, and it’s nice to have someone who will be patient and encouraging with me when i am not always patient and encouraging with myself. and finally, i was paralyzed by the prospect of internships and interviews and updating my resume, but i’m so grateful to have people in my life who have offered me referrals and to edit my stuff and to read over my emails. sometimes all it takes is asking for help. and now, rather than being filled with fear, i’m actually kind of excited about the whole process. i have a lot of hope for the fall. i feel like i’m in a much more stable place than the uncertainty that plagued me for most of last year. i’d even say that i’m happy. and of course my happiness scale varies from day to day, hour to hour, but i really do think that i am content with the way my life is right now. i’m less lost than i was, which i’m proud of, and i hope that in the future i will become less lost than i am now, and i think that i will be okay.

in my favorite  naruto  scene, a samurai and a ninja charge at each other. everyone expects their blades to collide in midair, but instead, this is the result: the samurai’s sword (left) slashes straight through the ninja’s sword (right) and breaks it in half. then the samurai says something along the lines of:  people are their blades! bluntness will not last. if your blade was too dull, that is because you yourself were too dull . he goes on to talk about how people who stay true to their beliefs continue refining themselves and remain sharp, while people who allow themselves to drift into nihilism lose their edge it shouldn’t come as a surprise that all my favorite battles are mental ones. for instance, the fights in  the matrix  are about breaking through self-doubt and illusion, the struggle in the  bhagavad gita  is about conviction and dedication of the self, and this  naruto  battle… well, i suppose you can interpret it as a literal fight with swords if you want, but everybody knows that sharp swords don’t actually cut through dull ones. i think this scene makes more sense when viewed as a metaphorical struggle against dullness. by default our minds, skills, and resolve all become dull over time, and it is only through constant commitment to some kind of value or purpose that we can keep ourselves sharp around a year ago my friend asked me:  do you think you’re a spiky person or a soft person?  they clarified that spiky people tended to interact with others in a logical and utilitarian manner, whereas soft people paid more attention to others’ feelings and to cultivating relationships, and then they said that it was usually easy to classify someone as spiky or soft but they were having trouble doing so with me because i seemed to have many elements of both. i explained that i was extremely spiky in high school and had been transitioning to a soft person throughout college, and that was probably the source of the confusion at the time i thought going from spiky to soft also meant going from sharp to dull – after all, they seemed correlated, and the denotations of the words matched up very well (this is one of the problems with inventing new meanings for words: you end up with associations between concepts which sound reasonable but don’t actually make any sense. be careful about the language you create for yourself). i assumed that by becoming softer and gentler and embracing self-love and acceptance, i was also committing to losing sharpness and conviction and willpower, and i didn’t even notice this was happening because i assumed it was all part of the process i think i have become quite dull over the past year. i am less fit, more prone to distraction, less disciplined, more afraid of commitment, and so on; i am trying to find my way again, and doing so very slowly. occasionally i will dive into a contest math problem just to practice thinking and working with the same level of desperation i had back in high school. i am disappointed in myself for slipping, and also a little sad that none of my friends told me what was happening, though i know it’s not their job to. perhaps they didn’t notice, or perhaps they didn’t tell me out of politeness (hi friends! if this is the case, please let me know next time; i respond best to direct feedback) it is irresponsible to push yourself to the brink of depression, to pump yourself full of anger and resentment and jealousy and to fuel the achievement of your dreams through negativity. i learned that last year and it is a major reason for why i decided to pursue softness. but in becoming dull i have learned this too: it is also irresponsible to lose sight of who you want to be, to stop pushing yourself and to lower your standards until you are no longer capable of pursuing your dreams everyone knows that deliberately manufacturing dissatisfaction and angst is a clear violation of self-care. less people realize that dulling and regressing and losing conviction will also breed dissatisfaction and angst once you realize how far you’ve fallen and regret what could’ve been, and therefore that too cannot count as self-care so i was once sharp and spiky, and then i became dull and soft, and now i am looking to become sharp and soft. i believe i can do so, and i am not worried about becoming spiky again in my pursuit of sharpness – i think my spikiness came from having unsustainable sources of motivation, but nowadays my main motivation is achieving what i want rather than fear of failure, and that makes a big difference last month i was at a house party and for some reason everyone else wanted to relocate to the roof. the only way there was through a ladder without any kind of guardrail or fall protection, which i really really didn’t want to take because i am scared of heights. i was shaking and terrified the entire way up, but i climbed the ladder anyway, because my friend was watching and i felt safer and freer around them – i felt like i could inexplicably do more than i usually could, simply because they were there. much later i realized  this is what it means to be sharp and soft , and now i wonder: how can i support and motivate myself in the same way my friend was able to?

in one of the organizations i’m in,  esp how does any student group run for more than a few years, then? one possibility is that it  . some groups renew themselves every four years with zero continuity, like living groups. other groups collapse, often from a cascade of small failures. a single bad recruitment cycle goes by, maybe because of a pandemic. the president takes sick leave and no one knows what to do. an officer forgets to transfer a mailing list. i’ve seen some success with intentionally transferring knowledge. esp makes a big deal of this. we have a comprehensive wiki, a huge google drive, and regular “cluedumps”, or transition meetings. but it takes time to set up the infrastructure for good knowledge transfer, and it’s easy to forget something small, like transferring a mailing list. the other strategy i’ve seen is having alumni stick around. that doesn’t mean that a graduate runs the group themselves, but that they’re available to help the students who   run things. not only are alumni more knowledgeable about these things, but for some reason they tend to be less busy. anyway, the point is that having
 
cruft ⁠ 01 term of endearment referring to mit alumni this applies in sitautions like, not knowing the password to something, or not understanding how something works. but there’s also unknown unknowns. for example, it was only through a graduate sitting in on one of our  assassins guild yesterday me and matthew ’23 were upgrading one of esp’s servers. the last time we had to do anything with this server was 2014. we managed to upgrade from ubuntu 14 to 16, but after upgrading from 16 to 18 we bricked the server. we ended up wiping it and installing ubuntu 22 from scratch, but that meant we had to set up everything again. matthew asked me, “who would know anything about this?” and i said “no one who’s now here, probably.” we lament the fact that we’re both seniors, and that there isn’t anyone younger who’s available to learn what we’re doing. we manage to figure out networking, but were stuck afterward. then we got a reply to our email, from jeffery ’22, who graduated last spring. he offered to get on a call with us, so we did. we talked about how no one’s going to know what we’re doing in a few years, no matter how well we document it. i mention that we’re graduating. matthew says we still have one year. i wanted to say that one year isn’t that long in the span of things. we get ssh and some other stuff set up over the call. before i leave, i tell jeffery that i miss him. he says he misses me too.

In the middle of an already-packed IAP, I received an email: I’d gotten off the waitlist for blacksmithing!  I was in a phase of trying to remember that I am a writer. I seem to enter this phase every time an important task in my life, such as a semester, ends, and I am adrift, searching the empty cavities of my skull for words.  I was busy and not sleeping much, however, so few words appeared. Hitting metal with a hammer seemed like a solid second bet. Besides, I’m out here to gather new skills and experiences to weave into stories later on. Blacksmithing, as a meche and a fantasy writer, seemed like a perfect thing to pick up. So I came into the forge, in the basement behind the glass, the place I’d eyed without knowing it since my first tour of MIT. There are displays of glasswork, and wrought iron candlestick holders which remind me of my Baba’s shabbos candles. The door handle is a beaver cast in bronze.  Previous Next The forge itself is full of tools, many of which were forged down here and never left. There are many sizes of tongs and hammers, punches of all shapes; everything you need, and lots of things you don’t know how to use. The place smells like coal dust and smoke, and during open forge you can hear the ringing of hammers and the   of the
 
power hammer. ⁠ 01 I am learning some names of things while writing this blog. I’m not sure if this stems from being a visual learner, such that names people tell me don’t stick, or just from having insufficient regard for the proper names of things. Kvothe would weep. Anyway I just googled 'big automatic scary hammer.' The IAP class lasts three days, during which you make a hook and one other project. In the exemplar they show you, making a hook takes about twenty minutes; when they set us loose to do it, we each took about one hundred twenty minutes.  After you’re certified in the IAP class, you can show up for open forge whenever you like. Open forge takes place once a week, usually on Mondays or Wednesdays, for two hours.  My first class, I made a hook. I thought I would just explain it but then realized I already did so in my  IAP blog First you forge a taper (or point) into the end of the bar, then bend it over the anvil, hammer it in towards yourself to make a curve. Then you do that again, in larger scale, to make a hook. Repeat that on the other side, so you have two hooks. Then heat the middle, clamp one hook in a vise, and twist. Forging feels old. So much thought goes into the process of any project: where to hammer to create a certain bend, how to heat just the part you wish to bend, what order to work in so that you have space to hammer where you need to. It’s a skill you have to develop through practice, trial and error.  There’s also a deeply physical aspect to forging. We have a power hammer, but it’s mostly used for hitting things very hard in one direction. Everything else you have to hammer by hand. Iron bends more easily when it’s molten hot, but you’ve still got to strike true. The second day of classes, I was massaging my forearm and an instructor asked, “Getting tired?” “Oh, I have carpal tunnel.” I was real proud of my delivery: perfectly neutral, not stressed, even though I was.  Good job, kid. Say it like that every time. “Oh,” the instructor said. He might have then reminded me to take breaks, then left me to it. The forge is surprisingly a good place to manage carpal tunnel, though, because it’s so individual. There are a lot of people in the forge, but not a great deal of conversation; it’s hard to hear each other over the clash of hammers. Generally once we’re taught safety basics — don’t grab things that might be hot, etc — we’re left to our own devices. I really appreciate this. Negotiating with pain, I can get caught in my head; I like the freedom to pause and breathe if I need. I take breaks while the iron heats in the forge, rest my hands and stretch my muscles, so that I can focus on hitting the iron hard and effectively while it’s hot. Also, showing up in cotton shirts printed with skulls and steadily developing muscle in my hammer arm is an excellent vibe. leaf no. 3 The open forge is a great set-up for pursuing personal projects. You can come in and make hooks and leaves ad infinitum, if you wish. Or you can come up with wild ideas, and if you don’t know how to bring them to fruition, the instructors probably do. One person forged an axe head, another a hummingbird. It was so cool watching other people’s craft and process. With each project, I’d watch a few YouTube videos of similar projects and try to note the techniques: where to hammer on a curve to get a certain bend, how much to let the metal cool before returning it to the flame. Then I’d try to develop my own process, and ask for help only after I’d failed enough times on my own. I felt like I was able to develop not just my forging skills, but also my approach to learning any new skill. I went to open forge almost every week, and here are some of my projects at the end of the year: clockwise from top: a candle / incense holder, tavern heart puzzle, two hooks, two bottle openers leaves I think leaves are real cool. Midway through the semester, I met Sulli Y. ‘22 at a writing conference. She told me how she apprenticed with a pottery artist during her gap year. Over the course of her apprenticeship, she made 100 mugs and 100 faces. That seemed like a fantastic way to develop a skill. I said, gleefully, I’ll forge 100 leaves! Leaves take a while, so thus far I’ve forged, like, six, but the sixth is distinctly better than the first. Previous Next bottle openers I will likely not forge 100 bottle openers, but I plan to forge a few more. My second was totally better than my first, although the design I made didn’t fully work as planned, and I had to weld on a back piece so that it could properly open bottles. tavern heart puzzle There are a few exemplars in the forge, mostly knives and swirls. And this wicked cool puzzle!  The goal is to remove the heart from the other two pieces. On the first day of the IAP class, I stared at it and clanked it around for five minutes. Then someone who knew the trick tried to solve it, and forgot the trick, but seeing them move the heart in a certain way helped me understand how the puzzle worked. I took it back and fiddled some more, and then suddenly the heart was free!  I put it back and took it out, thoroughly impressed.  Here’s how it works — if  you want to solve the puzzle for yourself, pause before 00:30.  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CKvS2euf7_0 At the end of the year, I decided I wanted to make a tavern heart puzzle myself. I like the craftsmanship of this piece. The center of the heart has to be long enough to poke through, and the circles have to be wide enough to let it. Everything needs to be sized precisely for the heart to be able to escape, but the other two pieces to remain locked together. I studied the pieces and thought about how to forge them. The bent loop came first. Then, I made the straight loop around it, since the two can’t be taken apart or put together once they’re finished. forge welding tutorial — I bent the end backwards and forged it to itself Next came the heart, which could be forged separate from the other pieces. I spent one half-day just learning to forge weld, so that I could bind the ends of the heart together. It’s an interesting process, very different from MIG, TIG, or stick welding. original and failed first attempt My first heart attempt went awry; it was hard to keep all the bends and curves the way I wanted. My second attempt, I planned the order of operations more systematically, and the heart came out more or less as planned. I kept checking sizes against the original, and you can place the original heart and my copy on top of each other almost exactly.  This was my last project of spring semester, and I finished an hour or so before the end of the final open forge. I
 
quickly ⁠ 02 actually this process takes ages, you gotta clean up every surface of the metal. 'Quickly' is maybe an hour? I enjoy showing this puzzle to people with the intro “You don’t have to solve this, but look what I made!” and then watching them sigh, like, “Amber, it is 12 am. And now I do have to solve it.” Then I sit there for several minutes while they clank the heart around. I offer to show them tricks, since I myself never solved the puzzle without tricks; they refuse. Do they at least want a hint? No. Having bent all the pieces into shape, I’m not entirely convinced they’re solid, cold metal now; I keep thinking that a hard yank could just break the heart free. Eventually, I’ll hear “Aha!” and the person I’ve saddled with this puzzle will pull the heart out, eyes alight.

A few weeks ago, I was reading  by Sally Rooney and someone asked me what it was about. I said that I wasn’t sure, but if I had to guess, it seemed to be about an affair but not the usual aspects of an affair that novels were concerned with, like whether or not the betrayed party would find out. Here, the affair seemed to be the most visible manifestation of more important, more illegible conflicts bubbling in each character. My friend responded, . But to be honest, I’ve finished that book now and I still don’t know if I know what it’s about. This is a long-winded way of explaining that I just finished reading   by Elena Ferrante, a book that feels inscrutable. It is about a girl in Naples who, over the course of her adolescence, learns of many deceptions that are mostly related to sex. Sex seems to be this insuppressible force, much like a tsunami, that controls all adults regardless of social class. The narrator’s high-status father engages in an affair with her best friend’s mother; the narrator’s impoverished aunt falls in love with a thief. The narrator becomes infatuated with a man who seems too brilliant and too kind to be bound by such fleshly desires, but eventually it is revealed that he, too, is willing to betray his fiancée for a night’s pleasure. I suppose the book is more of a collection of observations about human nature, about human relations, than a manifesto veiled in a fictional narrative. Maybe I’ve been reading a lot of books like that lately. When I was in high school, our English teacher wanted us to write essays that analyzed books for having a specific thesis. Back then, I composed sentences like, “ In  The Stranger , Albert Camus uses the motif of the stifling sun as a metaphor for Meursault’s super-ego to criticize the societal constructs of funerals and legal proceedings as superficial ways to maintain a facade of order in a chaotic world.” Every novel was a vehicle for the author to inflict their demands upon the reader.  To be fair, there are certain criticisms in  . I sense that Ferrante is critiquing our deceptions, to our own selves and also to others; at the end of the novel, when the narrator loses her virginity to a straight-talking boy just because she wants to, as opposed to exchanging it for social capital (as her aunt suggests she do), she is refusing to participate in much of the same deception that has governed the other characters. Yet deception lubricates the societal wheels of Ferrante’s universe and make it bearable for these people to live in a socially stratified city, with all the humiliations that come with being institutionally subjugated. These days, I find myself reaching for the books that don’t allow for easy answers. I’ve always wanted to know the truth,  , as if it is one obtainable thing to be held and admired. But I suspect I’ll be searching for the rest of my life.

Around this time last year, I was furiously wrapping two shipping boxes in Saran Wrap. Inside the boxes, I carefully loaded all of my clothes, my bedding, my shoes, the books I’d yet to read, my crochet hooks, an umbrella, and my signed  Rufus Does Judy at Capitol Studios My flight was set to leave in the morning from the B terminal of the Nashville International Airport, which was a foreign place that I’d yet to navigate on my own. At the ticket counter, I said goodbye to my parents, and my mother handed me a package of peanut M&Ms and an envelope to open at the gate, which contained photos of my parents, my sister, my cat, and my friends. When they left, I lugged both cardboard boxes to the counter and checked them onto the flight. I’m not a very sentimental person, but as I loaded my backpack and laptop and shoes onto the conveyor belt at security, I was fighting tears. At the gate, I sat in a chair facing the window, and I began crocheting. If I remember correctly, I was working on the beginnings of a burgundy beanie that would keep me warm in an entirely unknown and frightening Boston winter. I was in the last group to board the plane. When my group was called, I stood up and made my way toward the back of the line. Still sitting in his chair, a boy in an MIT sweatshirt nervously fiddled with his water bottle, which was covered in multiple layers of stickers. A woman who I assumed to be his mother pointed out the window to the airplane, which would act as the small, worryingly run-down vessel that would carry the three of us to Boston. I talked to the boy for a moment, running through the conversational protocol you quickly learn when you’re headed to MIT. I asked him what his FPOP was (Pre-Health), where he was from (Decatur, he drove up to Nashville for the flight), where he was living (Simmons, the same as me), and what floor he was on (3AB, a few doors down from my room). He was warm, but nervous, and he talked in a cadence I had never heard before (fast, especially for the South, speckled with laughter). He sat a few rows behind me and to my right, and I remember glancing back at him while the pilot came over the intercom to tell us there was a   issue with the engine. His head was already on the window, earbuds in. When I arrived in Boston, I had the daunting task of retrieving the boxes from the oversized section of baggage claim and hauling them into an Uber. It was my first time in an Uber, and the interior of this one was decorated with emblems from the Navy Seals. A pair of handcuffs hung from the rearview mirror. Boston is a  small city, but from that window, I’d never seen such a massive place. At the entrance of Simmons Hall, the movers took my boxes, and the desk worker gave me my key. Coincidentally, the room I was placed in (I later moved up to the 8th floor in C tower), was the room he had last year. He opened the door for me, and the movers set the boxes down, and I was alone. The room was L-shaped and about 1,000 degrees, which I would have to deal with for the next month or so. Drenched in sweat, I tried to unbox my bedding and put it on a bed (my roommate would arrive in about a week). I gave up when I got onto the fitted sheet phase, and decided to go downstairs and ask someone where I could eat nearby. Instead of telling me somewhere reasonable, like La Verdes or Saloniki’s or Dunkin, this person told me to walk to Singh’s Dhaba, which was a solid 25 minute walk down Mass Ave. Because I had no clue about the concept of Mass Ave (long street, keep walking straight and it’ll be there), I used Google Maps, which took me on the most roundabout journey through the neighborhoods of Cambridge. By the time I actually got to Mass Ave, I saw a Target, so I decided to just get snacks from there and turn around. When I got back to Simmons, I couldn’t get into the building. The security guard informed me that he would not let me into the building without an ID, even though he admitted that he saw me come into the building earlier. I asked him if I could just drop off my groceries in my room, and he said no. So, I left the bags of groceries to rot in the lobby, and I turned around to get my ID from Killian. When I came back, I tapped into Simmons, grabbed my lukewarm groceries, and started walking to my room. I was about twenty steps from the front desk when the security guard yelled again and asked me where my Covid test was. I asked him where I needed to get tested, and he told me the Z, which is literally thirty seconds from where I got my ID. So, I turned around again and made the long trek from Simmons to campus. There, a student watched me awkwardly shove a swab up my nose for the first time. I set the vial in the tray and walked back to the dorm. Finally, beyond pissed off at the security guard, I was allowed to get to my room. I learned that the door across from mine was supposed to be a bathroom, but for the life of me I could not get it unlocked. I shoved the key in the hole, turned it one way, pushed the door, turned it the other way, pushed the door, took the key out of the hole, pushed the door, pulled the door and put the key back in, turned the key, pushed the door. It was not opening. When I realized I wasn’t going to fix it on my own, I knocked on the door to my left, which was a single that belonged to an Interphase student. She didn’t answer. Then, I looked out into the hallway. The only person I could see was in the far right corner, a boy with extremely short, dark hair. He looked too busy for me to bother him. At this point, we were supposed to report to Killian to meet with our FPOP groups, and I was so defeated with the bathroom that I grabbed my things (my room key and ID on a  , which I cringe thinking about) and started to walk back to Killian. Underneath the tent, there were hundreds of first years, laughing and talking and sitting together. At this point I should mention that I knew  , and I mentally wagered whether I should walk up to a group of people and introduce myself. I decided that I shouldn’t, and instead I wandered around the tent trying to find my FPOP group. There were massive white signs that said each FPOP name (forty kids surrounding DEE, another fifty surrounding DME), and I could not find DUSP. Turns out, the student leaders of our group (who I now love to pieces and am forever indebted to their friendliness and warmth) were incredibly late, so we had no sign. After about five minutes of looking like an idiot, I found a small group of people sitting alone in the middle of the tent. This was the group. The group was friendly enough, but in an incredibly awkward and nervous way. Each time another person showed up to the group, we’d go around and introduce ourselves all over again. After about fifteen minutes, a girl showed up to the group, and she asked me if I’d follow her to the bathroom in Killian. I had no idea who she was. Per her instructions, I waited outside the bathroom stall. She complained about how she had grass stains on her shorts, and how it was so sweaty outside, and how she had another friend following her around that she wanted to escape from. We laughed together and exchanged phone numbers. Then, we ate shitty catering food, and I visited her room in Baker (a miserable double forced triple, which would stage the majority of August and September for me). She came back with me to Simmons, and I told her she could shower and sleep on the other bed. For a moment, we agreed to room together in Simmons (this never worked out, and we both found incredible friends in our respective halls). I spent the next week sweating through my sheets at night, eating questionably soggy apples from the Target trip, and waking up early for my FPOP, where I met some of the most incredible friends and professors (besides the girl in the bathroom stall, I don’t talk to the rest of the FPOP much today, but I think about them often). Still, I   pretty lonely. I missed home, I missed my friends, and most of all, I missed feeling entirely comfortable. I’m writing this mostly to document how far I’ve come (Now, I have a group of friends who I’ll see the day I get back to campus, and I have a room all to myself, and my boxes of things will be there when I get there), but also to tell the nervous first-year reading this that it is  , and it shouldn’t be. MIT is a colossal change, and if you’re fully experiencing it, there should be some heartache and awkwardness. It does get better, and god is it still so much fun. This post is dedicated to some of my now closest friends, who you’ll see below. More stories on them down the line. Franklin N. ’25 (Left) and Rafael “Rafa” C. ’25 (Right) Franklin, the boy at the airport, who introduced me to my most treasured friends at MIT, and Rafael, the boy at the end of the hall, who I now know without a doubt would’ve dropped everything to get that bathroom door open. Olivia “OJ” J. ’25        Olivia, the girl who dragged me into the bathroom without knowing my name and showed me that the best of friends can form in the strangest situations. First years, welcome to MIT.

This summer, living alone has given me the immense freedom to do whatever I want, however I want. Apparently, ‘immense freedom’ is just slang for ‘binging copious amounts of Dungeons and Dragons content.’ I’ve been watching a lot of Dimension 20, a tabletop RPG game show produced by CollegeHumor. The show has multiple seasons, with each season being a new D&D game with a usually familiar cast, with the occasional guest stars here and there. And I. Am. In. Love. I’ve always had a fascination with Dungeons and Dragons. For those of you who do not know, Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy TTRPG with…an incredible amount of rules and complexity, but for the most part, you can just imagine it as a bunch of people sitting around a table, roleplaying to a significant extent, and rolling a bunch of dice to make decisions in their made up world. As a kid, I thought I was going to be an author and I really loved worldbuilding and character creation. In fact, I used a lot of D&D resources to write a lot of my novels growing up. I found that the character sheets really helped me make a fuller, more three dimensional character. It was always my frustration in media when characters were introduced willy nilly, obviously carrying no depth to them aside from just serving as the protagonist’s main source of development or plot pushing. As I began watching Dimension 20, I was absolutely enthralled by the   everything had. Brennan Lee Mulligan, the typical game master for the show, creates such complex universes and, in his style of GMing, usually has big reveals and plot twists in the story. I’ve watched about three seasons of Dimension 20 so far: I wish I got introduced to D&D earlier (and I hope to eventually play..?) because there are just some things I’ve noticed that scratch my hyperactive, media-focused brain   right and I absolutely had to write a blogpost about it: My favorite kinds of books are the ones that are character driven — there can be little to no plot at all, as long as you have some really fucking cool characters. And that’s what D&D essentially is, at least the Dimension 20 shows. I am so captivated by the depth at which the cast creates their characters, the intricate backstories that all of them hold. But not only do the cast have these intricacies, but the NPCs as well. I played pretend a   as a kid, and one thing that would piss me off was when people just couldn’t commit to the story and the characters. They would giggle or laugh or get embarrassed and just ruin the immersion completely. What I love about D&D is the way that people are just fully committed to the bit. They put on character voices, they cry, they laugh, they monologue. And while yes a lot of this is pre-planned as you build your character and backstory, a lot of it is also dialog that occurs in-game. So many of my favorite moments in D&D are improvised conversations between party members, as the players just get fully enraptured in their character and the environment and just go at it. As I watched more and more D&D, the thing that stuck out to me most was the level of dedication and commitment players had to their characters. A lot of D&D is determined by rolling. Rolling for insight on a situation, rolling for deception, rolling for perception, etc. If these rolls are high, you can maybe notice things that your character or even the player wouldn’t have otherwise noticed. If these rolls are low, well, even if you as a player notice it, your character will not. For example, if you try to do something cool, or say a piece of dialog with the intent of being intimidating and cool, but you roll a Nat 1 on intimidation..well, it’s safe to say you’re no longer going to be as cool as you thought. And I think this is where the game gets interesting, how people create and play characters that are so vastly different from them that they must do things within character. Obviously this is just, well, acting, but it really makes my heart happy seeing that a game as beloved and as popular as D&D has such an intense element of acting and empathy within it. That you really, really must be your character. The rule of cool in D&D essentially is when a player does something reeeaaallly fucking cool…even if it doesn’t quite align with the actual rules and mechanics of the game. This is one of my favorite parts of D&D. It encourages players to think creatively, to call back on their inventory or past events, to scour the room and just do really cool shit in D&D. Some traditionalists might view this rule as irritating or annoying, but I think it really livens up a game and lets players really have full jurisdiction over the game and their characters. Here is Matt Mercer, arguably one of the greatest GMs of all time, talking about it. The new season of Dimension 20 is A Court of Fey and Flowers, an Austen-inspired season that uses the  Good Society I was so impressed by the attention to detail of this season, not only through the new ruleset, but just in the character creation itself. All of the cast thoroughly researched the era, some players opting to read Austen classics like   or   while others looked to more modern representations like   or even   (lol). But what captivated me most about this was the creativity players took with this genre. Players like Lou and Emily wanted to play villains, and so they researched the most hated Jane Austen characters and modeled their D&D characters after them. Brennan, who is playing in this campaign rather than GMing, decided to go the route of ‘What if there was a character who was the direct antithesis of regency and high nobility, but had to play the part?’ and so he creates a goblin character that is trying so desperately to follow the rules, but the rules of goblin society   breaking the rules. It’s an incredibly entertaining character to watch and some have described it as a perfect representation of a lawful chaotic. Then there’s Surena’s character, Gwyndolin, who essentially doesn’t buy into all this regency stuff and talks in matter-of-facts. Where in the typical Austen novel, characters are going to talk in roundabouts and dance around the point, Gwyn is direct and blunt. I really love seeing the leaps and bounds and creative directions that this cast has taken with the genre and it really makes for a unique experience and show altogether. // This blogpost was just a silly excuse for me to nerd out about D&D and D20. I highly recommend watching if you weren’t already convinced and really D20 has a special place in my heart. Watching the show, I feel like a kid again and honestly Dimension 20 has inspired me to start writing fiction again. It is a piece of media that has really kept me sane during a difficult summer and I am very grateful.

I’ve been thinking about different modes of transport through cities. In the past three years, I’ve visited over 10 cities and lived in three. Each of those three have their own method of transport: Copenhagen bikes, Tucson drives, and Boston, among other things, rides the metro. I grew up in a place where only driving made any sense. Now that I’ve been exposed to other ways of getting around, I’m thinking about what I want to look for in future cities I live in. biking this is the bike lane! It is very wide. In Copenhagen, Denmark, everybody bikes. A guide for a MISTI walking tour I went on explained that when cities were being re-built after WWII, they were designed with the new phenomenon of cars in mind. Copenhagen decided otherwise. Screw cars, they said. We’ll make this city as annoying for cars as possible. Instead we will ride bikes! We do in fact ride bikes. I’ve heard from most people here that cars are made expensive via taxes, which can double the price of a car. I’m not sure how this translates to used cars — some are cheap enough that doubling the price wouldn’t make them inaccessible? All of the associated costs of having a car, such as maintenance, are also notably more expensive. The bike infrastructure here is actually fantastic. The bike lanes are demarcated separately from roads and sidewalks, and are about 5 feet wide, so there’s space for two or even three bikes abreast. Most people bike single file, which allows faster cyclists to pass. Every major stoplight has a smaller set of lights for bikes. I’ve heard people who drive say that right turns are incredibly difficult, because you have to wait for a herd of bikes to fly past before you can even try; and then more bikes might come and cut you off. Bikes are parked everywhere. People don’t lock them to objects here, they just lock the back tire to the frame. It’s a little riskier, because an opportunist bike thief could easily drive up in a
 
big pick-up truck ⁠ 01 not that such things seem to exist in Copenhagen The pros of biking: exercise! I went to  Copenhell everything is max 30 minutes away by bike, which is nice I love seeing the city closer up, getting to know all the roads affordability Copenhagen. Some more bikes in the wild my bike cost $200, maybe $250 if you factor in bike lights and the lock. There are cheaper options, which I would only pursue if I knew how to tell which of those options will break apart in

hot ⁠ 04 well… warm anyway, like 80 F, or 27 C, which is standard in Tucson for most of the year. But up here people melt sometimes you are tryna bring cake to work this isn’t even Copenhagen, it’s Amsterdam, but do you see what is looking at that cool cat mural? Some bikes sometimes you want to make a big shopping trip. You enjoy bringing all the groceries in from the car in one fell swoop, but not from the grocery store when it’s half a mile away. “Danish society is proper,” you think, as you hold a 16-pack of toilet paper under one arm and guide the bike handles with the other.  apparently Copenhagen in winter is a city of darkness and cold. My friend who thinks 70 F is hot says that Denmark gets frozen and miserable for several months. For all of those months I would probably complain about every single bike trip I made. Biking isn’t accessible to everyone, though there are alternatives. The metro stations seem pretty accessible, and most of the city can be reached by metro, it just takes a bit longer. Bike lanes are open to wheelchair users as well. All in all, I enjoy biking quite a lot! I wish more cities had good bike infrastructure, because I can’t imagine biking everywhere in Boston or Tucson. guess what is outside that window? Bikes metro train in Berlin! When I visited Tucson this winter, and spent two weeks getting everywhere by car, I felt the change. My body longed to move. I didn’t realize that walking to class would feel fundamentally different, but it did. Subways similarly involve a lot of sitting. I don’t know how my body would react to using the subway long-term, as I’ve never lived in a city where subways are the main method of transport. I have, however, visited NYC, London, and Berlin, where the metro system works better than it does in Boston. The metro: cheaper than a car, good for people-watching, and much cheaper than ubering home after a night out. I don’t love metro commutes, but I understand the environmental benefits of cities being connected by public transit. I can also see the draw of being able to chill out on the commute, rather than being alert and navigating traffic, as one would with a car or bike. car I was going to turn my notes for this section into actual prose, but I think the notes get my point across: I love car; car go vroom. Car go vroom far away into mountain and down into valley. Car go vroom fast get places quick.  Car have space for cake for groceries for friends. In car can hear music go blast. Can sing. In car friend can read book while car go vroom down small winding highway.  Car have
 
AC. ⁠ 05 actually the AC in my car dies when it gets too hot. I always pause to appreciate the irony when it’s 105 F and the stream of cool air behind my steering wheel putters out Car as American dream. Metaphor for freedom, eats gasoline. And Then Boston Boston is a sweet in-between in terms of transportation. Many students cannot afford parking spots, let alone actual vehicles. But that’s okay, you don’t really need one — there’s a metro which only  catches fire Most of the interesting things that happen during college happen on campus, anyway. Ultimately I’m glad I was introduced to biking full-time to get around. I know that driving everywhere isn’t the most environmental option, and the costs of insurance and maintenance add up. In many cities, it seems that owning a car is more trouble than it’s worth. I still plan to own a car later in life, if doing so is practical, but for day-to-day commutes, I’m having a good time with bikes. I like that biking gives you a smaller version of the freedom cars afford you — and, hey, extra exercise! Despite the above complaints about scary fast cars on Boston streets, I’m looking forward to biking around more when I get back to campus.

playlist Today, I interviewed for a product manager position. At one point in the interview, they asked me, “What is the place you’ve worked at that you’re most proud of?” My heart swelled as I talked about MIT, and MIT Admissions, and Petey, and all of the admissions officers and bloggers. All the work that I’ve done and all the work that they’ve let me do. Simultaneously, my heart sank, as I realized how far I’ve strayed from that this summer. Work has been hard for me. I’m a loud, outspoken individual. For the most part at MIT, my character has been well received. People listen to what I have to say, they value my opinion, and they work with me to make change. As I talked with my friends who have graduated, they seemed to all mention a common theme: the workplace is no MIT. I didn’t quite understand what they meant by this when I first heard them say it. They said “Oh, the people are different…” or “You should really cherish your time at MIT.” And I thought to myself naively,  do But it wasn’t until I started working did I really understand the gravity of their words: the workplace is no MIT. This past summer, I found myself struggling to connect with people. I have many friends in my work and I’m grateful to death for them, but I find we’re not quite on the same wavelength. This isn’t meant to be an “Oh non-MIT people just don’t   it” in a snobby way or some intellectual dig. Rather, I think there is a special, intense understanding among MIT people to fully embrace being absolutely, unabashedly themselves. I’ve met all kinds of people at MIT: people who prefer walking barefoot because they read somewhere that it’s better for you. People who can’t quite meet your eyes as they talk and they stumble over their words because their mind moves faster than their mouth does. People who are the epitome of a party animal, throwing down shot after shot, but still answer quant trading interview questions blacked out. And from meeting all these people, their personalities have become my everyday, no matter how extravagant or large they are. Where my personality feels normal or even almost too bland for MIT, my personality in a non-MIT workplace sticks out like a sore thumb. I’m far too opinionated for my own good. I never know when to shut up, and I’m the loudest in the room half the time. As a result, I’ve felt somewhat isolated this summer. I’ve made friends and they’re absolutely lovely, but there’s still an ache in my chest, a longing to be fully understood and to be  . Though the people around me are people I love and cherish, they don’t understand that I can’t be my full self at work, why I can’t just sit down and be happy with what I have. The work environment I’m in is suffocating. I feel as if I’m constantly walking on eggshells everyday. I wince internally every time I speak a bit too fast or say something a bit too outlandish. I find no warmth in the people meant to support me in the workplace, even going so far as to say that I feel othered by them. They’ve find my personality too strong, too much for their workplace. These past couple of weeks have been hell for me. I sat in the office surrounded by people everyday, but I was the loneliest I had ever been. I talked and talked, but still felt as though I wasn’t really being heard. As the weeks went by, I tried my hardest to stick to my guns and bear the pain. I entered every day determined to be myself, even if it meant sticking out. And so I was. These past weeks I was loud and opinionated and vocal. And I faced many repercussions in the workplace for this. And as I did, I fell deeper into my loneliness. I looked around for someone, anyone, to help me. But help never really came. I always believed that if I found myself in a situation like this, there would be some sort of resolution, that whatever “justice” was needed would be appropriately felt, but I’ve realized now that this is not the case. As this happened, I ignored the way I felt, the nagging, breaking sensations that tickled the back of my brain. I didn’t want to cry about it because that means that they would have won, breaking my resolve. So I showed up to work every day trying my best to be authentic, but eventually it wore me down. In one of my first nights in San Francisco, I overheard a woman on the street having a mental breakdown. She sobbed loudly outside my meek and unobtrusive apartment building on California Street. Her wails were haunting. She was very obviously going through some sort of psychosis, as she begged and begged to no one in particular to help her. “I want my mom,” she cried, voice raw with such desperation and genuine fear. I had never heard anything like it, never heard a grown adult so openly weep for their parent. But funnily enough, twelve weeks later, I found myself in a similar position: lying on the floor of my bathroom, curled into a ball, experiencing my first mental break since my suicidal episode in the fall of my senior year. I wailed like she did, and though we were probably breaking down over very,   different things, I found it funny that twelve weeks ago I had wondered what things could possibly drive someone to such a state. And now, here I was. As I broke down that night, I also talked to no one in particular, cursing them and crying loudly. “Why?” I asked. “Why does this happen to me?” And in these moments it was so much more than workplace troubles that plagued me. Instead, it was a culmination of everything I feared. What if the problem really is me, at the end of the day? What if I’ve spent so long convincing myself I am a victim when really I’m the perpetrator? It couldn’t possibly be a coincidence that every time I go somewhere or do something, drama seems to follow? I can’t keep my fucking mouth shut for once in my life, can’t just be normal or content. I always have to make a scene or be bothered by something. I always have to be just a little different. I always have to put up some fight. It’s me, it’s me, it’s me all along. And I sat there, alone on the bathroom floor, thinking,  I don’t quite remember how I pulled myself out of here. The details are a little fuzzy and I think my brain forced myself to forget to relieve some of the trauma. Rather than keeping it all in as high school Cami would have done, I talked to people about it. I told them of what I was afraid of and they assured me it wasn’t me; I really was going through something shitty. I felt relieved. I think there was some part of me that thought what I was going through was normal, that the corporate workplace really is   that bad and I wasn’t strong enough for it. I’m glad to be wrong. After some particularly emotional calls with the various support structures in my life, I was able to step back and really view everything as a whole. I had embedded too much of myself into my work. I craved their validation, even though I really needed nothing from them at all, and I had let it get to me a bit too much. More than that, though, I’ve gotten a taste of the corporate world and understand now that while my personality may be one of my greatest assets, it’s also going to be the thing that’s going to bite me in the ass. Knowing this now, I’m hoping to learn how to curb it and refine it, make it more palatable for people’s tastes while still staying authentic. I try not to dwell in regrets, and it’s a lot easier said than done. I find myself drifting into ‘what ifs’ and ‘maybe insteads’, and I’m learning to cope with it. This summer felt like a waste of my energy and my time, but I do walk out of it with some good things: a lot of lessons learned, a better understanding of what I want and what I deserve, a newfound sense of resilience and independence, and some new lifelong friends. And while I am grateful for the lesson in growth, I am hoping that this fall is something different, peaceful and good, as I spend my last year in the only place that has ever been able to understand me. Here is to senior year. #'cami where have you been?' in hell i have been in hell

I’m not a particularly good cook. I once managed to set spaghetti on fire while trying to
 
boil it. ⁠ 01 it was in the pot with water and everything... don't ask This summer in Berlin, I lived alone again, with a kitchen all to myself and lots of free time and mental space to allow me to actually get groceries regularly. So, I told myself that I would once again cook regularly, and managed to stick to that with surprising ease. Now, I’m not a big foodie, which is something I’ve come to realize in comparison to some of my foodie friends. One of my closest friends is actually starting a  fine dining pop up series 
bland. ⁠ 02 part of this is also definitely cultural. i have low expectations for the flavor profile of any food I eat  the basics.  When I want a big and filling meal, I like to follow the formula of picking a carb base, a protein, and adding some vegetables and greens for a bowl-like situation. Here’s the list of the core ingredients I’ve been cooking with: 
fried eggs ⁠ 03 I love the texture of a runny yolk over pasta 
sausages ⁠ 04 and boy is Germany good for sausage... . ⁠ 05 it's the pinkish ones in the photos below , which I loved as a child but wasn’t allowed to have too often because they’re “unhealthy.” perks of being an adult include feeding your inner child :) Previous Next breakfast-type food (not always consumed for breakfast).  Sometimes I want a heartier breakfast than just yogurt. Other times making pasta for dinner is too much effort. The solution, inevitably, is eggs. I’m a
 
big fan ⁠ 06 if you couldn't tell yet... Previous Next slightly more inventive dishes.  Occasionally, I would feel adventurous, and spend some extra time cooking a more involved dish, or buy an ingredient I don’t normally bother with. Generally, though, these meals would still follow the same formula of base+veggies+protein. To be honest, most of these meals turned out thoroughly underwhelming. I struggled a lot with getting the texture right, and I was too cheap to buy elaborate spices when I was only living somewhere for 10 weeks. I tried making fried rice, without looking up a recipe for it. it tasted okay, but the texture was wrong – too clumpy and too moist. chicken stir fry:  this isn’t actually ragout in the normal definition of the word, but it’s what I would call   in Russian: a hearty mix of potatoes, vegetables, and meat. I had never really cooked this before, and it definitely showed: I overboiled the potatoes and the broccoli, which made the whole dish unpleasantly mushy. and I made so much of it too, I had to eat it for a week… Previous Next this wonderful meal.  Finally, I want to highlight
 
this elaborate meal ⁠ 07 I already mentioned it in my blog about misti, but this post wouldn't be complete without it Previous Next In conclusion: cooking doesn’t have to be hard or take a lot of mental energy! In my experience, the formula of carb+protein+vegetables goes a long way to a balanced diet. Each day, you can just fill in the blank of which carb, protein, and vegetable will go into your meal, and bam! dinner’s cooking. Looking ahead, I’m moving into

Last month, my friends and I saw Mitski live. I didn’t know that many Mitski songs, but I went to her concert anyway because the songs I  did  know made me certain that everything that happened inside of me had happened inside of someone else before. At the entrance of the venue, a woman who was checking IDs glanced at me and said, “You’re definitely under twenty-one, right?” I laughed her off because I wasn’t planning on drinking anyway. She drew an  X  on the back of my hand with Sharpie. My friends and I joked about how the opener, a band called The Weather Station, had a vocalist that sounded similar to Mitski. All the merchandise was expensive but I bought a shirt anyway, a $30 mint-green crop top, partially because it was cute enough and partially to remind myself that I was a thousand miles away from the life I used to have. As the main act was about to begin, we wiggled our way through the crowd and found a spot where, if we held our heads just right, we could see most of the stage. As the first notes of “Love Me More” drifted in, Mitski stepped out, and the audience erupted into frenzied cheering.  The first Mitski song I ever heard was “Your Best American Girl.” Her voice starts slow and smooth, like honey, until it climbs into the frenzied chorus. She sings of heartbreak that creeps up on you:  don’t wait for me, I can’t come,  that slow realization of an insurmountable abyss. Lyrics like  your mother wouldn’t approve of how my mother raised me  suggest that the fundamental incompatibility between the two lovers is steeped in racial and cultural differences. In the music video, Mitski, a half-Japanese woman, waves at a white boy, who waves back until a white girl intrigues him more. Mitski’s smile falters. The boy and girl begin making out. Mitski makes out with her own hand. When I watched the music video, I felt embarrassed on her behalf. Why was she so enthralled with this mediocre man? Why wouldn’t she want to be with someone who thought she was beautiful, and not just beautiful for an Asian woman? I was young enough to think that I already knew everything there was to know about myself. I didn’t know how easy it is to become what you once scoffed at.  I would never be with a boy who makes me feel that way , I thought, not as a promise but as an observation. And this has turned out to be somewhat true in that I have never had a boyfriend who is fully white, but this has also proven untrue in other ways because I have had boyfriends whose families were much wealthier than mine. I met my first boyfriend through a high school chemistry class. We were both ambitious and eager to prove ourselves. We’d attended the same talented and gifted program when we were younger, but at different times, so our lives had never overlapped before. Attending such a program had given both of us an easy hubris, the sureness that we were destined for somewhere better than our public school in Portland, Oregon. (I cast my arrogance off after I arrived at MIT, like it was a kitschy scarf that had been silly to wear. I don’t know if he ever cast off his. We haven’t spoken in years. Apologies for spoiling the end of the story so early.) In mid-September of that school year, he made a Facebook account and we started chatting through the platform. Later on, I would learn that he had made the account just to talk to me, a move that struck me as both flattering and questionable. But mostly flattering; after all, he was the first boy to ever confess his interest in me. We had a lot in common, I thought. We both wanted to attend MIT. Our class differences were subtle enough that I didn’t notice for months. The car he drove was a hand-me-down from his brother, old enough to still have a stick shift. Most days, we took the same school bus home. I didn’t pay specific attention to fashion, but his clothing seemed inexpensive and functional. After we began dating, I visited his house, which had few walls, floor-to-ceiling windows, and remote-controlled blinds. One got the sense that every detail had been meticulously planned.  The renovations, I was told, gave the place a valuation of $4 million. What was it like, I wondered, to have the confidence and the resources to wreck and rebuild your world to align with your dreams? We spent many evenings there, studying. He was good at chemistry because he actually liked it, and years later, he would go on to pursue a chemical engineering PhD. I have always been drawn to people who are genuinely passionate about what they do, and I found myself growing quite fond of him. When measuring against the intensity and depth of the adult relationships I’ve had since, I wouldn’t describe what we had as love, but there is no denying that I liked him. I liked him a lot. My boyfriend’s family owned a beach house on the Oregon coast. Some weekends, they asked him to go there. “I hate being here,” he texted me on one such visit. “Next time you should come with me.” “Haha maybe,” I texted back, hoping he wouldn’t ask again. (It’s only now that I realize what he wrote wasn’t a question, but a demand.) And I did get what I wanted: the topic of me visiting the beach house never resurfaced. For him, I did a lot that I would normally never do. He was one of the top chess players in the state, so I learned the rules and sat across from him at the board. But after a few rounds, he got bored. “You’re not good enough for this to be exciting for me.” So I tried other things. I sat through  Inception . I listened to his bizarre theories about the psychological differences between the sexes. I edited his literature essays. In the winter, we started studying for the chemistry olympiad, which we’d convinced our teacher to host at our high school for the first time. I bought a used copy of Atkins’ 3rd edition of  Chemical Principles  and learned all the subjects our high school chemistry class hadn’t covered, like the Schrödinger equation. I sent him links to recommended textbooks, but he didn’t purchase any. I downloaded practice tests, but he didn’t want to bother with them, so I completed the exams alone. The day of the contest came and went. When results were posted, we found out I’d received the highest score in the school. He had scored ten points below me on a sixty-question test. I was frustrated. Why didn’t he try? I wanted to do math, not chemistry. I had studied for him, and he hadn’t even made a respectable effort. And no, this boy never did any AMC practice questions. He never listened to the K-pop I liked, he didn’t read any of my writing. When I won a schoolwide slam poetry contest and moved onto the citywide competition, he didn’t attend the performance.  But I can’t truly blame him for not trying; after all, I had never asked him to do any of these things. He was a sixteen-year-old boy and it hadn’t occurred to him that his girlfriend had a life of her own that he could participate in. And it hadn’t occurred to his girlfriend that she should expect to be more than a piece in someone else’s jigsaw puzzle. I was so distracted that year, I didn’t realize that spring had arrived until it was almost over. May in Portland happened in fits and starts, as if it weren’t certain of its inclination to warmth. To me, it was AP exam season; to my boyfriend’s family, it was boating season.  He asked me to go, and I said I had to study, I had to work, I had to volunteer. I told him he should take our mutual friend instead. He stared at me. “Why will you never go out on the boat with me?” I had run out of excuses, and we both knew it. I fumbled to explain. “It’s too bourgeoisie . . . I’m not like that. I don’t know how to do things like that.” To make matters worse, I wasn’t even certain if I was pronouncing  bourgeoisie  correctly, having only ever seen the word on paper. That was something he made fun of me for, my mispronunciation of words I’d never heard spoken aloud. Honestly, I barely understood my own hesitation. I knew how to swim. I didn’t want to explain to my conservative parents what I was doing with a boyfriend on a boat, but that was a surmountable discomfort. I imagined myself sitting in a swimsuit, the boat knifing through the Willamette River. The sun spilling itself all over us. The endless water. Closing my eyes whenever I wanted, red summer against my eyelids, knowing I wouldn’t drown, not in a place like this. Excess. When I was a child, my family had been on food stamps. But wasn’t that the point of everything? To end up somewhere better than where we had been? Why would I let the past anchor me? That June, Imagine Dragons came to Portland. My boyfriend’s family had tickets, but his older brother decided not to go, so my boyfriend invited me in his place. We all knew Imagine Dragons. Their chart-topping single “Radioactive” had made them rock stars, but I had liked them since they landed on the  Billboard  Hot 100 with “It’s Time”. These were box seats, seats my family couldn’t afford ourselves. Honestly, concert tickets were a luxury we wouldn’t indulge in. I wanted to go, I really did. But the concert was the evening before my SAT exam, which I was taking for the second time. I texted him that I was very sorry, but I couldn’t go see Imagine Dragons. He wasn’t happy. He asked, not for the first time, why I cared so much about this exam when I had already received a score in the 99th percentile the first time I took it. To placate him and assuage my own guilt, I suggested he bring a mutual friend instead, the same girl he took on the boat.  When my mother heard, she shook her head. “You told him to take  her ? How can you be so naive? Rona, you don’t understand anything about men.” I recalled a story Mom had once told about a family friend. When his future wife met him, she knew this was the man who could get her out of China and into America. In the months leading up to their immigration, she wouldn’t let him talk to any other women, not even female friends. She wasn’t willing to risk losing her new life for his wandering eyes. I knew what my mother was implying, but I trusted my boyfriend. Anyway, he had already asked her, and I wasn’t about to demand for a change of plans. He went to the concert with our friend. I took the SAT and got a score high enough to satisfy any college in the country.  Three months later, we were broken up and he was dating the girl who had said  yes  to everything I had said  no  to. When asked about her motivation for writing “Your Best American Girl”, Mitski said: “I wasn’t trying to send a message. I was in love. I loved somebody so much, but I also realized I can never be what would fit into their life.” I got into MIT early action and my ex-boyfriend was rejected. By the time we received our decisions, the breakup was far enough in the past that this victory didn’t grant me any vindictive pleasure. Besides, he didn’t need to get into MIT, not the way I did. When Mitski sang,  You’re the sun, you’ve never seen the night , I thought about the ease with which he carried himself, unmarred by any notion of scarcity. When she sang,  I guess I couldn’t help trying to be your best American girl , I recalled the requests he made for me to fit into his life, how he never tried to understand mine. The boat was never mine. The concert ticket was never mine. Those were gifts from a boy who could reclaim them and give them to anyone else just as easily. But that SAT score, that MIT acceptance letter, those belonged to me. They are mine even now, remnants of a younger self who didn’t know where she wanted to go but knew she needed more than a boyfriend to get there.  As Mitski sang, the spotlights cast her in eerie, otherworldly colors: fuchsia, lime-green, indigo, lime-green again. I felt like I was made of guitar strings strummed by her voice; I wasn’t sure where I ended and she began.  I didn’t get to see Imagine Dragons, but here I was, years later and thousands of miles away, seeing Mitski instead, enveloped by friends and strangers and music, my own best American girl. after the Mitski concert with Selena ’24, Laura ’23, Caitlin, Izzy ’21, Jude ’22, Tiffany ’22, & Alice ’22

I’ve been reading a lot of slow, contemplative writing recently, which is the kind of writing that always makes me want to write my own blog post of that nature. Frankly, I’ve been overdue for such a post, both in the sense that I haven’t appeared on the admissions blogs for a while, and in the sense that I haven’t really been engaging in self-reflection at all this summer. Usually, when things go wrong—and things have been going wrong—I try my best to sit down, contemplate, and then write until I have arrived upon the actions I need to take to put my life back together again. This summer, however, I have been putting off responsible behavior, ignoring life’s great questions, and,
 
instead of getting back to the people I   to get back to ⁠ 01 with deep apologies to everybody who I have left on read this summer; I promise I'll get back to you eventually.  to work on, I’ve been going out into the city and wandering, enjoying the mere pleasures of life, and scarcely sparing a thought for all the woes which continue to sit in the back of my mind, accruing interest. Time, however, ticks incessantly, and it is now August, meaning that, in just two short weeks, I will be back to campus for REX, and then the semester—my last undergraduate fall semester—will begin,  leaving me no time for self-reflection or recovery , as it were, ⁠ 02 the french <em>essayer</em> means 'to try,' or 'to attempt', and is the root of the english word 'essay'; or, as my academic advisor once told me: writing an essay is a process of 'trying' a variety of different thoughts and expressions of them before eventually concluding at the truth, which is why, often, when writing an essay, you have to write a first draft before you realize what you were even trying to say in the first place. Unconvinced by my first, cursory investigation, I did a little more surveying of the soul, looking for some hint of rain or thunder, but my overwhelming sense was that everything was fine. Now, “everything is fine” sounds unremarkable, but, to me, it was this completely new feeling. I don’t remember the last time I felt like everything was  . For the past few years, my emotional state has almost always been fields of  , punctuated by periods of   or  . It felt like I had ascended to some
 
inexplicable fifth level of Zen, ⁠ 03 which is definitely not a real thing in any religious tradition, but bear with me. , and that was  . This realization was extremely surprising. I had made the explicit choice to aim at   over   this summer; making decisions which brought me short-term joy, like
 
buying tickets to see every musical in town on my own, ⁠ 04 I've seen five musicals this summer, I think, and am planning to see at least one more Aristotelian  -ness seems to be exactly that idea of happiness. It’s like I’ve been walking randomly through a forest, having ditched my GPS five miles back out of frustration, and suddenly I’ve found that I’ve reached the top of the mountain despite making no real effort to climb it. So, what happened? What has changed? When I think about this question, the only answer I can think of is that, well,   have changed. I’ve been The  rule I ended up setting for myself 
I could act however I wanted, do whatever I wanted, ⁠ 05 I have been chronically unable to internalize the advice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_effect">nobody cares as much about what you are doing or that you are trying new things than you</a>, which is always helpful to remember, but somehow the <em>guaranteed </em>lack of impact here made it much easier to remember. And so I did just that—I went to

cheering for the Seattle Sounders. ⁠ 08 yeah, yeah, MLS is bad, sue me. I'm enjoying it. and of being in a completely different location, away from the stress of MIT. This feeling of change has only accelerated with the weeks, and I am now flying through new versions of me that nobody needs to know, and it is not so bad. I drive myself to work every day. I have started reading again
 
with the explicit goal of getting better at writing, ⁠ 09 I can't really fit this in the post, so here's a footnote. For the past year or so, my strong belief has been that the best way to get good at writing is the act of writing. I started reading again this summer, for the sake of doing so, and simultaneously started listening to more poetry as well, and felt this instantaneous change in my writing, and so I am back on the 'reading is very important' train. 
my writing style change with each new author. ⁠ 10 in other words, if the sentences in this post are too long, blame Marcel Proust.  “Well, I can solve that problem in this other way.”  This summer, the one voice I still converse with has become a friendlier one, although I can still summon the anxious voice when I need to. I feel like I have become friends with myself, and it is nice. The biggest change that this shifting sand of identity has brought has been a freshly renewed openness to new feelings and experiences. I wrote a poem this summer which included the phrase “If you open yourself to the potential vigorousness of feeling,” which seems to me to be the most important choice of all. You have to find a way to let go of the fear of trying new things or of mild disappointment; you have to choose to accept the possibility that you might feel something or that you might find joy in something you did not expect. This acceptance has been the shared thread between all of my newfound pleasures; letting the feelings wash over me as I look at a piece of art, or cheer at a soccer game, or sit in a park and read, looking up on occasion to observe the skyline. I have a new sense that the thing which defines   is  , and so I am doing my best to feel, and to care, and to have it all add up at the end of the day. To summarize, I have fooled myself into feeling more, and have found myself all the better for it, and isn’t that wonderful? Between this changing self and this newfound willingness to merely feel, even the most difficult question in life— . I want to  . I’ve never felt an answer so clearly before. Sure, the question of “what is your plan after graduation?” is
 
a concrete one which requires deep thought, ⁠ 11 I am thinking about — wait for it — graduate school. 
“what is your ultimate goal in life?”, ⁠ 12 ideal is 'house-spouse who writes poetry part-time', but i'll settle for working on interesting problems in interesting domains. and to   about living. This summer, I’ve been running a small poetry workshop, in the style of some of the classes here at MIT. Every Sunday, a group of us meet over Zoom. Everybody brings one poem, and we go around, first reading the poem aloud and then discussing it. For this past week, I wrote this poem. It’s not my best work, and I’m not particularly attached to it, but there is a quality within which captures this sentiment better than paragraphs of text can: 
i want to catch trains with you on unplanned trips, 
to catch bubbles on foreign streets, 
to splash in the ocean in khaki shorts, backpacks holding all of our life’s work, 
to wander half-certain into art galleries and to ask “how does that make you feel?” at inopportune times; 
i want to find our soul returned to us in the bottom of a cup of tea, 
to find myself lost in the vicissitudes of our lives, 
battered back and forth by waves of people, 
holding on to each other for dear life, as if it were the last moment in our lives— 
together, 
together, 
together. And, so, having answered one of life’s biggest questions, perhaps it is ultimately unsurprising that I feel completely fine. The changes in myself that I have felt over the past few months are simultaneously minuscule and tremendous; they can only be seen in these tiny changes in behavior, and yet they have radically shifted my perspective, and, by proxy, my sense of place. To be honest, I am not sure if it is possible to precisely explain to you how I have gotten here—each of us must find our own routes to peace, I think—but I am glad to have arrived at this waypoint.  I am about to return to MIT, and I am nervous that some of this progress will evaporate again as I return to the world of the living. I am once again burdened with responsibility and eyeing a classload too large to handle. For the first time in my life, however, I am unafraid of what comes next, both in short term of the semester and in the long term of post-graduation. I cannot help but feel that as long as I keep myself open to the vigorousness of feeling, and do my best to manage whatever else lies on my plate, it will be a very palatable lifetime. Much of this feeling, of course, is a result of the luck I have had to stumble into MIT and then into these internships and experiences, and I have, on occasion, felt guilty that I should feel so secure in a world so riddled with insecurity. Yet, I have come to the conclusion that everyone deserves a world in which they can be happy—and that believing this does not preclude, and, in fact, may require, a belief that I should be allowed to fight for my own happiness. In the meantime, as long as we continue to care for one another, perhaps it really will be okay. There may come a time when I no longer believe
 
the particular shade of optimism ⁠ 13 I want to take the opportunity here to distinguish my optimism from naiveté; I have been cynical and pessimistic in the past, and that has only faded with age, which is weird, but which I have appreciated.

My first year was a little rough. I could’ve written more about the low points, but it takes a certain amount of humility and retrospect to not sound like an ass in doing so. I’ve got them all written down, and once I’ve had a chance to reflect and forgive myself for stupid mistakes, I’ll share them here. I would like my sophomore year to be less rough. Logistically, I think it will be. I have friends now that I adore, and I simply didn’t have them in the earlier part of last year. I’m moving to a new residence hall, which I think might make me happier. I’m figuring out what genuinely brings me joy career-wise, and I’m doing personal projects simply because I enjoy them. I’m getting better advice, or at least I’m learning to ignore terrible advice. I’ve gotten a lot of what makes MIT hard emotionally over with, so I’m not as scared to fail again. I know it’s good to have goals in life. I never really got around to making any before I came to MIT because I had no idea what to expect. If having a 5.0 GPA was attainable (it wasn’t), then that was the goal. If landing a big-name internship for my first-year summer was attainable (it wasn’t), then that was the goal. If taking 66 units of classes and sleeping every night was attainable (it wasn’t), then that was the goal. In the end, the only attainable goal was to survive MIT, and I did that. I think there’s a statistic floating around somewhere that if you write down your goals, they manifest into reality. I’m not sure if I believe in that. What I do believe in is the power of hundreds of strangers potentially reading this and placing mental bets on whether or not I succeed. So, out of spite, these are my goals for sophomore fall.  a load finished. It sucked. or  . That’s not as fine. I feel like I would’ve fared better grade-wise if I just forced myself to go to all my lectures  get even more confused if I went to office hours. Even though I know it will benefit me academically to go, I know this is a little bit of an ego issue for me, so I’m going to force myself to go to more office hours next semester to get over myself.  about instantly pawing for my phone when I feel awkward, uncomfortable, bored, or nervous. I’ll literally scroll through old emails, look at my phone settings, or move apps around just to avoid feeling bad. This can’t be good for me. If anyone has advice on how to stop this I would appreciate it. Okay. I think that’s all I have for now. Now I know y’all are clambering for my coursework decisions, because I am known for setting myself up for horrendous semesters. Here’s fall:

 in mit, and undergrad in general i guess, you spend your time hanging out with your classmates. you go to classes with them, work on problem sets and projects with them, live with them, cook with them, play board games with them. you live in a place with a high density of people you’re friends with, because you’re on campus, and all the undergrads are on campus, or near campus. i spent my time with my classmates. i went to class with them, worked on problem sets and projects with them. on weeknights, i’d play board games, or go to lectures, or eat out. on weekends, there’d always be events: a competition i’m helping run, a program for high school students i’m teaching for, a party i’m attending. there’s always someone to hang out with, always someone available to work next to or play smash with. i used to think i’d burn out, that by doing everything, i’d end up doing nothing. in practice, i enjoyed having lots to do. this summer, and my internship, are different in a lot of ways.  the bay area is big my coworkers are all cool, but it’s different. i don’t feel as comfortable inviting someone to play board games with me after work, and it’s not like people have dorm rooms i can crash and hang out in. sometimes dinner happens, and people eat out together, but more often than not everyone goes home before that. when events do happen, they’re  . someone gauges interest in, say, a volleyball game, then they send out an invite on google calendar. yes, a  why is it different, then? is it just the culture that makes me feel uncomfortable reaching out to my coworkers to hang out? the age gap that makes me feel reluctant? is it the fear that they’ll say no, because they don’t like the same things i do, or because they need to go home, or because they’re busy, what with families and significant others and whatever grownups do after work?  at the company i’m interning for, i feel like  there’s no speed limit i like it, sometimes, the feeling that there’s always something to do. that i always had  room to become better imagine sisyphus being happy on weeknights, the ones where there aren’t any volleyball games or dinners out, sometimes, i want to work. my excuse is that i like my job, enough that i want to keep doing it after five pm. my cynical side says that it’s a bad habit i picked up from mit, because in college, no one’s going to tell you what times to work or stop working. why is it so frowned upon to willingly do work outside of work? i get why it’s bad if you’re doing it to make a deadline, or because you’re forced to. but if i tell my friends that i do work after dinner, because i   to, they ask what’s wrong with me. when my roommates spot me with my work laptop on the couch, they tell me to stop working, even when i say i   to. when my mentor sees me replying to a message after hours, she tells me to get off slack, even if i   to. a friend suggested that maybe it’s because we’re expected to have families, or something similar. a home to tend, a community to take care of. the implication being that if you spend all your time at work, you’re neglecting some other aspect of your life. because that’s what “work-life balance” is about, right? that’s why “get a life” is an insult, right? as if   have a family to care about. the closest thing i had to that was mit, and i’m not there.  it’s this societal expectation of “work-life balance” that leads me to build these walls between my work and the rest of my life. if a thought comes up during work that i think would be interesting to look into on my own time, i’ll draft an email and send it to my personal. or, if during my own time i think about something work related, i send an email to my work account. or, how i’m not logged into my work google account on my phone. sometimes it’d be convenient if i was, like if i wanted to check my earliest meeting tomorrow, or so i could read documents while commuting. i’ve given in and shared my google calendar to my personal account though, or at least, the free/busy details. or, how i’m not logged into slack on my phone. well, i wasn’t logged into slack on my phone, for my first two months here. i don’t know when or why i gave in, but i’m logged into slack now. i have it tightly muted so i don’t get much notifications, but it does enable behavior like replying to slack messages at one in the morning. on those weeknights, the ones where there aren’t any volleyball games or dinners out, the ones where i want to work—i stop myself. i try to do something else. read a book, write a blog post, play a video game. none of that feels interesting. instead, i lie in bed, scroll through twitter, and oversleep. i’m not sure what i get out of these walls, but i have them anyway. i tell myself that it’s the right thing to do, that this is what work-life balance is about. i tell myself that i’m working at a startup, but i don’t have to succumb to the overworking startup culture. because i should spend time with my family or something, right? or, is it because if i work too much, i’ll burn myself out? or because i should spend time on the rest of my life. but what   the rest of my life?  the things i talk about with coworkers and the things i talk about with my non-work friends aren’t that different, and sometimes i wonder if they should be. is it acceptable to talk about my past relationships? what about my troubled family history?  my depression . one thing that i have talked about, both with coworkers and other friends, is what people do outside of work. the other day there was a picnic for incoming mit students in the bay area, and a handful of current students came, most in the area because of various internships. i remember talking to someone who mentioned that he just didn’t know what to do after work, that he was so bored after coming home. i wanted to say i felt the same. i asked if he wanted to eat dinner that night, and he said maybe. we didn’t. today at work people asked me about my future plans. i said i didn’t want to go to grad school. someone asked why, when school was so fun. i told her that   was fun, but grad school felt different. she said that she had a lot more free time in undergrad, compared to when she started working full-time. back in undergrad, she spent a lot of time playing games with her friends. now, she says, she spends her time at home procrastinating on washing the dishes or cleaning up. not doing chores, but not playing games either. that in-between state where by wanting to do everything, you end up doing nothing.

The day in question is Thursday, one day before the end of my internship. 7:00 This morning I woke up nervous as hell, mainly because I didn’t know where to buy cake. I also had an end-of-internship presentation to give, and my mentor had invited 30 people. We have a tradition at my company, see: every time someone has a birthday, an anniversary, or goes on vacation, they bring cake to work. They send a notification in the social channel of Microsoft Teams. In my office, the engineers all look at each other; “Cake?” We scramble from our seats and scurry to the fourth floor. Usually we are the first ones to arrive. As many people go on vacation in summertime, this happens nearly every day. This is my last week here, so I had to pay it forward. Issue is, bakeries close early in Denmark, and I hadn’t been able to find anywhere with cake that was open past six yesterday. Luckily for me, however, there was a bakery on the way to work.  I showered quickly, put on one of my three collared
 
shirts, ⁠ 01 this company is chill enough that I usually wear rock T-shirts and jeans without rips. 
can, ⁠ 02 the BOLD cans, in fact, which taste much better when they cost 10 krones (~$1.50) at the supermarket than they do for $5 in the MIT vending machines We bike everywhere in Copenhagen — the bike lanes are wide, and the cars all know who’s boss. It’s fantastic. Except when you need to carry cake to work on your bike, then you sort of wish for a car. a whole herd of bikes 8:15  I found the bakery! It’s a cute place not too far from work. There was no cake, but plenty of baklava, so I ordered two big boxes. As the baker filled the boxes, he offered me a sample. Then his co-worker came out with a pan of cheese-filled pastries fresh out of the oven, handed me one swathed in napkins, and warned me not to burn my mouth.  10/10 would recommend.  8:45 I
 
arrive ⁠ 03 is this blog in past tense? Is it in present? I don’t know. I am an engineer now. It’s lucky I remember what a semi-colon is. I take my laptop and head upstairs, where I tuck myself in a mutebox, which is like an insulated telephone booth designed for taking zoom
 
calls. ⁠ 04 see I even use ‘like’ in blogs! My mentor is quite nice. I already knew this, but it was proven to me again: yesterday was the first time in my life that I gave a practice presentation and didn’t receive feedback to speak slower. I suppose it’s also possible that I simply managed to speak more slowly, but uh…
 
I doubt it. ⁠ 05 my first weekend here, I was talking to someone who said to me, 'I don’t mean to be racist, but,' and I nodded, like, ‘uh-huh, go ahead, bro, I’ll text my friends whatever you say,’ until he finished, 'but you talk fast, for an American.' I cracked up and assured him that most Americans also thought I talk fast. Then I texted my friends about it. I’ve had more sleep than I had yesterday — I’m still recovering from an all-nighter I pulled on Saturday in Paris — and the words seemed to come more easily. I slowed down, pointed to all the graphs, remembered to breathe in between. Before I knew it, the minutes ticked to 10, and it was time to go present. 10:00 My internship at Seaborg, a nuclear reactor startup, has been centered around finding good insulation materials to shield the reactor core. The design process is in the works, and it’s been interesting to see how all the engineers work together to orchestrate one very complex system. My work has been just one tiny piece of that, but even so, I’ve met with several different people to discuss what I’m doing and what the ramifications of my project will mean for them: some need space to put pipes in, others need to know how much heat will penetrate my shielding. Everyone I’d met with showed up to see the final project. There were others, too: the cool process engineer, some upper-level engineers, and friends who work in process or chemistry but showed up to support me.  I took a deep breath and talked about what I did. I’d written a model to analyze heat transfer with different materials, and I’d written a colorful flowchart to show that. I talked through the chart, and my process for choosing and recommending insulators. Although I didn’t say so at the presentation, this was not only my first large coding project, but my first time presenting code to a group. One of my biggest takeaways from this internship was my disillusionment with code, in a positive way. Being left to my own devices to write a model, I was able to forget my assumptions about coding and instead see MatLab as a tool to be leveraged.  After the presentation, people hit me with questions, many of which I hadn’t considered before. Had I thought about how this would affect water flow? Could my model be extrapolated to encompass de-commissioning the reactor? What about adding coating around the insulation to change the emissivity? After digging deep into the minutiae of this project, I felt like I was coming up for air, remembering again how my insulation project connected to many other systems. Two questions bounced off each other, and the engineers who asked them started discussing a heat transfer system I hadn’t heard of yet. The system we’re building here is so big, and I want to dig deeper in, to understand more. There’s much to build, and a lot for me to learn. 10:30 Cake from a week ago, when Seaborg had a birthday. Presentation done, I offered everyone baklava. Then I went back to the office and wrote down the questions and comments everyone had. One of my co-workers, Robin, offered an idea for how to simplify the model, so I poked around with that for a bit, then looked over my mentor’s edits on my project report. 12:00 Lunchtime! My company caters lunch, and on Thursdays we get cake. Like official, at-lunch cake, in addition to the cake people bring in. Today it was banana bread, but in the same shape as cake.  A few friends and I ate on the rooftop. The conversation started at three-meter long alligators and then veered into leeches, which we sustained as a topic for the duration of our meal. I do not know why.  12:30 On a normal day, I’d go in, turn my sitting desk into a standing desk, and start paging through articles looking for specific thermal properties of a material, or work on my model in MatLab. On this day, however, my second-to-last, we were all joking around. A lot. The company is hosting a camping trip this weekend, and half my office is coming. Summer is sinking in. I fixed the finals edits on my report and turned it in. Then I went to wrapping up my MISTI reports, until 3:30, when I heard that a co-worker had brought his labradoodle to work. 3:30 It was a very good labradoodle! He could shake hands and lay down and even roll over. Work ends between
 
4 and 5, ⁠ 06 “it’s 4:00 I bike to the beach with my co-workers Robin and Christina. We go to swim in the ocean 1-3 times per week, but this was the first time in two months that I remembered to bring a bathing suit and a towel.  Another thing I like about this company is that I can be the young intern who is distinctly swimming in a bra and underwear and then shivering in the sun trying to dry off, surrounded by my overwhelmingly male engineering department, and no one gives me looks or treats me differently afterward.  In the water, we talk about the reactor and how it’s going, and about Robin’s vacation in Barcelona and Christina’s unfinished tattoo. Christina finds the corpse of a jellyfish and we throw it at each other until it falls apart. Previous Next 5:00 I get home and sit in a patch of sunlight from my west-facing window. As the sun falls, the patch climbs higher, and I have to keep moving up my floor. I read a Sylvia Plath poem aloud — I’ve been doing this every day, holding the words in my mouth, making myself slow down and digest every line. I congratulate myself on my dedication to arts and culture, then open Instagram and scroll. 5:30 Running time! There’s a cute woods by my apartment. My legs are angry because yesterday I did squats.  After running, I stop to pick up protein bars for the camping trip. I enter the store with very little hope, as Denmark doesn’t seem to have the same market for over-priced, pseudo-health bars as the States. I wind up finding some, though, which is sick. 8:00 I meet with a friend at Berkeley over zoom and we discuss her start-up project based around fuel cells. It sounds quite exciting. As she talks about it, I start to think of the processes and systems she’ll need, and how much I’d learn while building something like that. 9:00 I pack for the camping trip! We’ll only be gone til Sunday, but the weather in Denmark is nefariously tricky, so I pack clothes to account for if the sunny forecast grows cold. I also pack a birthday present for Christina, a bottle of wine from what I hope is a classy brand. I jot down some notes for a poem I’m planning to write when I get back, just in time for a weekly poetry group I attend with other
 
MIT students. ⁠ 07 organized by Alan! 10:00 pm I hop in the shower and then heat up leftovers for dinner. I think that at some point in my life, I will graduate from eating like a stereotypical bachelor from the 80’s, but it’s not high on my priority list. Despite that, I did learn to cook a new dish here! It’s curry! It currently takes me like 45 minutes but I think in the future that will change! Anyway, it’s pretty good, and I have leftovers enough for three meals. 11:00 pm I read some more poetry and lil short stories from Blue Earth Review, a literary magazine the size of two phones laid next to each other. The window is cracked open, and chilly air flows in. I’m huddled on the bed, knees tucked to my chest, too tired now to read each word aloud. I think of the last time I’d written anything, only a week ago, and find myself reaching for words. Finishing this internship is bittersweet. I’m excited to have a few weeks to myself, to work on my own projects, but I’m going to miss the community here, which I found myself becoming part of. Hopefully I’ll see the friends I made at work around Copenhagen. I’m going to enjoy the last moments of it. I fall asleep, ready to go camping the next day. Previous Next

As a child, I was a hugely voracious reader. I spent the majority of my free time reading, and also a significant part of my non-free time (i.e., in class while my teachers were talking…) I started reading less around the time I started high school, when paying attention in class became more important and I found some fun extracurriculars to occupy my time. This trend continued at MIT (what, you mean MIT students aren’t famous for how much spare time they have and nothing to fill it with?) Part of my problem is that although in life, I’m generally a pretty disciplined person, I have no self control when it comes to books specifically. If I have a half-hour left before bedtime one night after I finish my work, I can hang out on the internet for 30 (or, you know, maybe 45) minutes and then go to bed. But if I start a book, that book is getting finished, that night. Partly, this is because I’m lucky enough to be a really fast reader — most books take me just a few hours to read. But unfortunately, “just a few hours” is not short enough to start a book at 11.30 pm when you have class at 9 am :( This summer, though, things are different. I’m working
 
an internship ⁠ 01 I just graduated, but I'm coming back to do my master's, so I'm still interning and not full-time employed yet 
not a lot ⁠ 02 I'm kinda lonely in NYC lol. Post on that coming soon... When I was a kid, my mom would drive me to the neighbourhood community centre every weekend for whatever class I was doing that season — gymnastics, archery, etc. — and after class we would stop by the public library in the building. I would wander down the shelves and pick up whatever caught my notice, take out a huge stack of books, and read them all week. As an adult, I still don’t quite have that kind of time, and although there are some public libraries near me, I often have something specific in mind I’m looking for. So I started using the Libby library app, which lets you connect your library card (or more than one!) and take out ebooks from your library’s digital collection. In the community of voracious readers, I’m definitely a bit behind on discovering Libby. But now that I’m here, I LOVE it! It is so amazing to be able to have any book I want with just a few taps. If I’m hanging out with a friend and they recommend me a book, I can literally put it
 
on hold ⁠ 03 If you don't know what this is, it's basically a waitlist for the book. They only have so many copies, and if they're all taken out, you can put it on hold and it will get to you when it's your turn on the waitlist. I’ve read somewhere around 50 books so far this summer. Some of them were not that good — when I can instantly take any book out, don’t have to carry around its physical weight, and can probably finish it in three hours, there’s not a huge sense of investment. So I’ve read some pretty random shit. But I like that I have enough spare time that it doesn’t feel like every book I read has to be amazing or else my time is wasted. Sometimes it can just be a way to pass a few hours visiting a different world, or seeing our world through someone else’s eyes. Here’s the highlights of my summer reading so far: Yes, I still read children’s books. Why not? They’re good, and enjoying kids’ books doesn’t mean you can’t also enjoy books for adults. : This is set in a classic medieval-with-the-edges-filed-off world where some people are wizards, but each wizard can only manipulate one kind of object. The protagonist is a baker’s apprentice who has bread magic. Of course, she’s pulled into some issues that are way above her pay grade… The premise is cute, but what I really liked about this was that it had Terry-Pratchett style philosophy weaved through it about community, heroism, and war, and that the plot, while solidly child-grade, went places I wasn’t expecting. It was fun and refreshing. : This was the first book I ever took out from Libby, because after I downloaded the app I went to the “available now” section and it was the first thing listed that looked remotely interesting. I was stunned by how good it was. A novel very much set in North America today, it’s written from the perspective of an elementary school girl with undiagnosed behavioral issues. The adults around her (her single mother, the overworked and undertrained early-twenties daycare workers, and her unsympathetic teachers) range from trying and failing to help her, to not trying at all. The plot stays realistic but ends on a lovely hopeful note. I loved this book because I felt like it so accurately reflected the complexities of life. You can put a lot of labels on the issues that this book addresses, like single parenting, neurodivergence, medication, and race, but at the end of the day, in the real world and in the book, these all blend into a complicated, difficult, and yet beautiful life. Reading from a young child’s perspective isn’t as grating as you might expect, although it occasionally wore a little thin for me. : Although it somehow never crossed paths with me, I’m given to understand that this was one of The Big Series for middle schools girls of the past decade. The series is very definitely Young Adult capital Y capital A, but I’m really enjoying it. The characters fail to communicate, jump to conclusions, and act irrationally way too often, but they’re also a bunch of traumatized twenty year olds so I guess that’s reasonable. The book has a similar arc to a lot of YA series — without too many spoilers, a cruel empire and some people who are special for various reasons working to overthrow it — but I think it does it better and more realistically, giving you real empathy into how complicated and difficult life can be inside such an empire. It also has truly excellent pacing: it doesn’t make you wait too long for reveals, and yet after each reveal there’s always more to go. By about the middle of the second book, I had a sense of where the arc of the series would lead, but each book feels like a natural followup rather than a rushed series of events or a drawn-out wait for the main event. : this one is kind of cheating because it’s been my favorite book and comfort reread for pretty much the entirety of the 9 years since it was released. It follows the first semester of college for Cath, a girl with anxiety who loves to write. Write fanfiction, that is, among other things. Her fandom of choice is a Harry Potter derivative that’s just different enough to evade copyright and stay interesting. But the real draw of the book is the way you can fall in love with every single character and see life so vividly through Cath’s eyes. The plot is neither predictable nor full of twists — it just  , because it’s life My anxiety is pretty different from Cath’s and I have exactly two
 
very abandoned ⁠ 04 If you can find my barely-started fifth grade HP/PJO crossover, I'll give you a cookie and also kill you : From the guy who wrote the Martian, it’s the Martian, but even better. If you don’t know the Martian, basically both of these books are “there is a dude in space trying to solve some scientific problems and he uses actual science knowledge to do so”. They’re gripping, human, and also super nerdy and cool. The science in this book is definitely a lot more speculative/made-up than the Martian, but it’s still a lot more detailed and realistic than most books of this type. I won’t spoil the reason that I think this book is so much better than the Martian. But I will say that the linguistics nerd part of me was extremely delighted. : this is an action/thriller focused series about a rogue cyborg-esque being who is officially considered property and not a sentient person with rights, in a far-future world where corporations have almost all the power. It’s written in first person and the cyborg has a very particular voice which I found funny and enjoyable, if at times a little much. Although the themes of capitalism and sentience aren’t new to sci-fi, I liked the irreverent take on them. The level of action was a bit overwhelming for me at times, but I’m a lightweight, so I suspect it might be a big draw for some. I didn’t know what to make of this book, and I got the sense that the Goodreads reviews I skimmed afterwards didn’t either. So much of it is very mundane, like reading a middle schooler’s boarding school novel. I also enjoy those, so I actually liked that, but the Goodreads reviewers did not seem to. The central difference isn’t quite a plot twist: it unfolds slowly but out in the open, and you might find it easy to quickly figure out early on, although that won’t lessen the horror. This “twist” barely affects the plot of the novel, and yet it seeps through everything. I thought about this book every single day for the few weeks after I read it — I couldn’t tell you   I thought, but I certainly thought about it. : this is the true story of a lesbian couple trying to conceive a child. I went on a queer parenting kick a while back and read a lot of books that were about very interesting families and parenting journeys but not very well written. This one was the exception: at the same time as being an interesting and at times painful account of how difficult it can be to conceive, it’s also a beautiful love story and character study of the couple. : This is quite a book. About a city out of time, full of many children and few adults, set up by the gods Athena and Apollo to test the theory of utopia that Plato lays out in his Republic. It’s stuffed incredibly full of Classical references, most of which went over my head despite my Classics
 
concentration. ⁠ 05 At some schools down the road, cough cough, a concentration is a major. At MIT, though, it's 3-4 classes, so slightly smaller than a minor. Completing a humanities concentration is a graduation requirement. If you’ve read and liked any of these, or check them out based on my recommendation, let me know your thoughts! And if you think you have a good rec for me based on the above, I’d love to hear it :) #books

there are decisions that i worry about long after i know which choice i’m going to make, like  whether to go to mit choosing what to do this summer i’m reminded of this saying in software engineering: you ain’t gonna need it. you’re thinking about this too hard, but you ain’t gonna need it. you’re not focusing on what   to get this feature written. you’re planning for futures that won’t happen, because unless you already have a well-defined plan for the future,  . if you already know what you want, go for it.

i am in the tenth week of my summer job and i can remember how the first three weeks each felt blissfully long, as if i’d found a way to cheat time, and how everything since then has melted into an indistinguishable blob. this is a familiar experience, the feeling of days blending together and passing faster and faster, like sand in an hourglass falling, a light trickle growing into a noisy downpour. i remember high school summer camps, every semester of college, group houses in new mexico and alaska, always following the same pattern – a glimpse of immortality followed by a reminder of death. this is the mirage of novelty, and it has a simple explanation: one of the more popular theories of memory asserts that healthy brains do not really “lose” or “forget” memories, and that forgetfulness has more to do with an inability to retrieve information than a problem with how that information was stored. when many memories are similar to each other without anything to distinguish individual ones, each one interferes destructively with the others, so that an attempt to recall any one memory results in a confused recollection of the entire group. this is why you remember the first few times you try something much better than the rest of the times, and it is also why mnemonics are effective – they take similar pieces of information which would normally interfere with each others’ retrieval, and give each one a unique identifier the days are long ,  sam altman said ,  but the decades are short . he is right, of course. i can already feel that this decade will be short short short, much shorter than the previous one, unless i pull as hard as i can to stretch it out. in his post, sam wrote: Do new things often. This seems to be really important. Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think. Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life. older people keep telling me that youth is a blur, that years 22 to 28 will pass in the blink of an eye, and so on.  thank you for presuming how my life will go and for giving me unactionable advice , i think to myself, but i know they mean no harm. i believe their words are more reflective than predictive, that when someone declares your time will pass quickly what it really means is that  their  time passed quickly, that i can do a better job of slowing down time than they did, and i fully intend to try recently i was reading a  blog post  about aging and love and i came across the following paragraph: Lately, though, I’ve searched for that feeling — the feeling that a great and grand adventure still awaits — and it eludes me. I’m already on a moving train. This is the great and grand adventure. The pieces of my life have, more or less, fallen into place. Despite my resistance, I can see the imperfect plan — one that surprises and moves me — if I squint steadfastly at the horizon. and it’s beautifully written but it also makes me want to scream at the author –  why aren’t you switching trains? how can you just accept that the pieces of your life have fallen into place? do you realize you are choosing to accelerate the passing of time?  i am in a headspace where i cannot fathom why anyone would ever willingly settle down, where i cannot understand why anyone would, say, start a family or root themselves in a community if they had the option to sprout wings and soar through the world. why work the same job in the same city for twenty years when there are so many roles to try and places to absorb? perhaps i am being selfish. i often hear arguments of the form  you Should have a kid to do your part in continuing the human species  or  you are Supposed To plant yourself in communities you care about to better support them . clearly i haven’t been listening very attentively, but i do understand the concern they are raising perhaps i am still just a child, addicted to the feeling of being alive, unable to stop myself from reaching for more. maybe more mature adults discover a different feeling to subsist on, one that is more responsible and less impulsive. whatever that feeling might be, i have not encountered it yet, and i wonder if i ever will perhaps this is all in vain, some kind of foolish monument to my ego that i will regret later. i remember someone telling me that most people have a core desire which guides most of their actions, such as wealth or love or power or comfort. over the years i’ve become more and more certain that my core desire within this framework is knowledge, both of myself and of the world, and maybe that explains why i have been so restless. but sometimes this desire feels empty – i have not yet reconciled with the fact that everything i ever learn i will eventually also forget i am in pursuit of novelty, of a way to separate the moments from each other, of a way to make the decades feel longer than the days. but there is something i have never been able to understand: how much of that pursuit comes from a genuine desire to explore the world? and how much of it comes from a desire to escape my current self?

I’m in Washington, D.C. today for a work trip, so I write this blog post from a hotel room that has not one, but  queen-sized beds. (One is for sleeping and one is for jumping.) Being an intern and feeling bad about asking my company to spend a lot of money on me, I decided to only stay here for one night. I got up at the crack! of! dawn! to catch my seven a.m. flight to DCA, which is one of three airports that serves the D.C. area. In retrospect, I should have just flown in last night and requested a second night at this hotel. Then maybe I could rotate between the two beds and spend one night sleeping on each of them, so neither of them feels left out. On the flight, I read more of  by Elena Ferrante, which is a translated Italian novel. I’m not sure what it is about yet. In a Harvard class I took years ago, the lecturer said that the ending of a story defines what it is about. And I haven’t reached the ending of this book yet. I was somewhat hesitant to read a translated book, because I thought a translation will always lose something of the original, like how light always scatters through glass. Since I don’t speak Italian, this may be true of the English translation of   and I simply don’t know it. But this version that I propped up against my airplane tray table and spent the hour between Boston and D.C. with, this version is pretty fantastic too. After landing, I went to work and was besieged by many work-related tasks, most of which are related to Wi-Fi connectivity or GitHub or Python and thus not interesting enough to discuss here. One incident of note: I didn’t realize that the address on my company website is not the exact address of our office, so for some time, I wandered through a nearby mall, thinking we might be nestled between Forever 21 and the food court. Alas, it turned out we were actually located in an office building that required badge access, a badge I did not have. At the end of the work day, our team went bowling. This brings us to bumpers, the title of this blog post. these are bumpers. photo courtesy of iStock I’m terrible at bowling. I was not looking forward to demonstrating to my coworkers exactly how terrible at bowling I am. In fact, I considered just ditching the activity altogether. It wasn’t mandatory. But then I thought about how the entire point of flying out to D.C. was for  and it would look bad to not bond, as if I were a noble gas or something. And not even one of the cool noble gases that everyone knows, like helium or neon. But like xenon. I didn’t want to be xenon, so I went bowling. “I always use bumpers with my friends,” I told my coworkers. “But . . . yeah. Maybe not this time.” It is relevant to point out the following: I was the youngest person there and the only intern (everybody else was a full-time employee); I was the only person of color, out of about twelve people; I was one of four women; and I was the only woman in a technical role. Also, at 5’2″ and 100 pounds, I was the smallest. None of the other people were using bumpers. If I used them, that would cement my position as the kid, as the one they had to accommodate, as the one to not take seriously. Now, you might be wondering:  I don’t have an easy, surefire answer to that. But I chose not to use them, so that’s the answer I chose today. And predictably, I couldn’t even strike a single pin for the first several turns. Round after round, my ball fell into the gutter. Was it painful and frustrating and embarrassing? Yes. But did I eventually get better? Also yes. I learned how to time my throws more accurately, how to position my thumb more precisely, how to toss more forcefully. The first round my ball did not land in the gutter and instead knocked down a few pins, my coworkers cheered. This is not to say I became a bowling champion by the end of the night. I never got a strike or a spare. But I improved vastly from my string of zeroes. And I realized the following:  . This might not be a particularly insightful observation, even when applied more generally. The notion that one must “take the punches” and suffer without safety nets in order to learn is an idea I’ve encountered before in self-help books and TED Talks. But it has always been difficult for me to willingly do uncomfortable, not-so-fun things in pursuit of growth. When I studied for math contests in high school, I liked doing the problems I already knew how to do, because they were fun, and avoided ramming my brain against tricky questions I couldn’t easily solve. When I prepared for coding challenges last year, I gravitated towards topics I excelled at and not the ones I was weak on. So does this revelation about bumpers really change anything? The knowledge that vegetables lead to longevity and good health does not make them any easier to eat. I still have my fundamental nature to reckon with. And these days, I’m becoming more and more skeptical of our pursuit of  , or at least of the capitalistic forces that drive our desire to become better. What actually matters here? If I never bowl a strike in my entire life, I’d be okay with that. Still, I’m considering what hardships I’ve been avoiding, how that has hindered my progress, and what bumpers in my life I need to remove.

Earlier this summer, sitting at a bar in Berlin, a friend and I made a bet. I had been telling him about my research interests and my desire to stay in academia at least for a while yet. Hearing me talk, he made a comment, half-joking, something to the effect of “I can’t wait to read an article about you in twenty years.” That caught my ear, though. No way, I said. I’m not trying to do anything extraordinary, I just want to live a calm life and do a little science while I’m at it. We had been talking about ambition, and how its meaning and importance changes over time. I said I wasn’t ambitious, anymore, that I had let go of that in favor of sticking with science, which, for me, was an accessible and emotionally easy life path. He laughed at that, and we made a bet:
 
$20, 20 years from now, ⁠ 01 I wonder how that'll hold up with inflation  true. Maybe the problem is my definition of ambition. Do science and ambition, for me, necessarily need to be opposed? As it turns out, asking that question has opened up a whole can of worms about my approach to work, science, and passion. So, I’ve spent the summer mulling this over and trying to find a framework of definitions and priorities that make sense with where I am now. Now, in high school, ambition was easy to define. I wanted to excel at everything I did, which was actually within my reach because excellence was so clearly measurable: I got good grades, advanced to nation-wide competitions, won scholarships. Then there was the college admissions process: another easy avenue for ambition. I wanted to get into the best schools, I dreamt of MIT, and, well, here I am. At some point, also, it occurred to me that ambition could be even broader. If I can get into some of the top schools in the nation, who’s to say I couldn’t do well in other competitive pursuits? If I tried, I could probably get a top-tier internship in software or
 
finance. ⁠ 02 is this overly confident? confident, definitely, but it’s not so unthinkable, even now Soon, though, or maybe even simultaneously, it occurred to me that I didn’t even have to be ambitious. I didn’t have to work   hard. I’ll be the first to admit that I worked way too hard in high school, to a point where it was actively harmful and unsustainable. I didn’t want to experience that kind of extreme burnout ever again. I had already made it to MIT, didn’t I deserve a break? Shouldn’t I be able to take it easy from here? I found myself appreciating, for the first time, the idea of an easy life: a 9-5 job, nothing too crazy, no overtime, plenty of time in the evenings and on weekends to focus on my hobbies, to read and write. Wouldn’t that be nice? No more applications, no more competitions, just some job that I don’t care too much about but pays pretty well. Yes, this was the burnout speaking. But is it so bad to not want to work myself to exhaustion? I’ll be honest: it felt good. It felt good to let go of the ingrained expectations, the drive to be doing the most I possibly could be in any given moment. In this way, my freshman year was restful. I was working again, I was studying and contributing to projects, doing all these things that take effort and energy. But with my new mindset, I cared so much less about my success, and that made all the difference. Still, somewhere over the course of freshman year, I had realized that I do actually like science as
 
a type of work, ⁠ 03 see my previous blog about grad school freshman summer Of course, it’s not that simple. Part of the reason I wasn’t trying too hard in those projects was that I was still exploring what I wanted to do in the long run. I picked the UROP because I felt a need to do research, and it was similar to what I had done in high school. I went to NASA as a last-minute decision, almost, because MISTI got cancelled that summer, and the project was vaguely in my area of experience. I didn’t feel fully committed to the projects because I wasn’t fully committed to the field itself. Then, halfway through sophomore year, I had a realization about what I wanted to do with

Now that I had decided that I wanted to apply to grad school, I needed to put myself back into the mindset of  : working on my resume, applying for scholarships and fellowships, thinking about publishing. All of a sudden, it felt like I was back in high school: I needed to care about my grades, I needed to   in some abstract sense, I needed to make sure I had something to show for whatever research I did. In other words, I needed to get back on the grind. From my

my name ⁠ 07 at the end of a long list of authors, but still something I’ve recently started listening to this podcast, called  , which a friend has been recommending to me for years. The podcast is hosted by two scientists, both of them biologists, and each week they invite a guest scientist who is in some way prominent in their field. They then ask the guest questions about their scientific creative process: how do they generate ideas? How do they come up with interdisciplinary approaches? What does science mean to them? Hearing these people talk about their relationship with science has been fascinating and eye-opening, and I highly recommend the podcast to anyone remotely interested. One theme that seems to come up particularly frequently in these conversations is the idea of science as obsession. Everyone featured on the podcast is, in some way, obsessed with their science. They live it and breathe it. For them, it’s far from being just another job: being a scientist is a fundamental part of their identity. This is what I’ve been scared to admit to myself: that I’ll never, in good conscience, be able to fully separate myself from my science. I am happiest when I’m excited about my work, to the point where I have to actively stop myself from letting it take over my life. Yes, I could work in science, and treat it as just some other thing. But what’s the point in that? I only do research because I’m passionate about the fields I work in. It makes little sense to pursue science if I’m not going to be serious about it: if I want a 9-5 job that I don’t care about that much, I might as well work at literally any other job that pays better than a PhD stipend. In the end, I think my “big realization” from this winter wasn’t so much about wanting to stay in science as it was about accepting that to be truly happy – and fulfilled – in science, I have to give it my all. I think this is my new definition of ambition: one that’s compatible with the pursuit of a career in science. Maybe all being ambitious means, for me, is allowing myself to dream big within the context of science, to take on harder projects in more impactful fields. Being ambitious means not being scared of difficult work or of new research areas. It means daring to dream that I can do work that matters. Moving forward, I resolved to find again the drive that had powered me in high school, and turn it back to my research and my love for science. Sitting in my childhood bedroom over winter break, starting a new research notebook, scribbling down all the directions I wanted to explore and fields I wanted to read more about – all of it felt incredible. It felt good to   again, to feel excited about the research I would do in the coming years. I applied for a long-shot
 
research fellowship, ⁠ 08 I ended up getting it, actually, more about that in the future :) Now, that’s all well and good, and I’m glad that I’ve rediscovered my drive and reframed my ambition to be directed at something I’m truly passionate about. But doesn’t obsession lead to burnout? Didn’t I have good reasons to avoid this kind of work-centered lifestyle in the first place? I think the short answer is: yes, absolutely. Although I’ve been happy to be able to focus on research this summer, I sometimes feel like it has come at the cost of “having a life.” Most weeks, I wouldn’t really go out on weeknights, choosing instead to stay in and work on one project or another (and I of course have plenty to choose from). At the very least, I committed strongly to not working on weekends, which I am proud of. Still, I feel like I haven’t made the most of my summer living abroad, while also feeling like I haven’t done enough research, although I know all of that is foolish. I’ve fallen back into my old trap of feeling like I don’t have enough time to do everything that I want to do, because I don’t. I want to do so much science, I want to learn so much, I want to get better at math and CS. But I also want to travel, to read books, to write poetry. I want to explore the city I’m in, I want to spend days sitting at cute cafes and people-watching in parks. And I feel like these two desires are at odds with each other. The truth is, I can’t be happy with just one side of this equation. I am, on some fundamental level, a workaholic: the happiness I derive from working on projects I’m passionate about is often greater than the happiness I get from relaxing or doing something fun. As much as I might wear myself out, I also become unhappy if I don’t do good work for long periods of time, so the solution can’t be to just chill. Which is, of course, not the healthiest approach, but that doesn’t stop it from being true. I’m prone to working in ways that lead to burnout, and I’m already feeling that this summer. How unexpected, that giving myself the expectation that I should work on my projects for five days straight each week would be unhealthy and unsustainable. Who knew that three separate research projects would be too much for me to focus on at once? Totally unpredictable… I don’t think I actually have a good answer to the question of how to balance my passion for the science that I do and the desire to have a somewhat healthy lifestyle. I think I am naturally predisposed to go through cycles of extreme motivation followed by burnout, and I don’t think this is good. But I also just don’t know how to break out of this while also embracing the obsessive nature of science, and I  want to embrace it. If I’ve learned anything from the past couple of years it’s that my love for science is one of the most fundamental parts of my identity, and I am happiest when I let that side of myself thrive. I don’t know if I’ll go on to do extraordinary science, but that’s really beyond the point. I do, however, want to do the most and best science that I can, and I need to accept that and find a way to make it work long-term.

I’ve been putting off writing. I have half-baked blogs with lists like books I’ve read this year, events I organized, art I made, and even longer lists of the books I want to read and the places I want to go, and things I want to build. I have more ideas than I have time to execute and I hate picking so I try to do everything and finish some things and not others so the perfect blog detailing everything I’ve done is never completed.  I’ve been putting off writing. It feels like once I’ve put pen to paper to publish I’m tied to the person I was or the beliefs I had when I wrote that. This is why for the most part my past blogs aren’t deeply personal though sometimes hints of my life find their way in. And if the past year has shown me anything, it is that I have changed. The idea of authority over my life gave me tearful breakdowns freshman year. Now, though I’m still unclear about my path ahead, I have peace in my confidence that I can and will figure it out. Despite my fears of losing community, I’ve been learning to let go of those I loved that have hurt me. And I’ve been putting my pride aside to acknowledge my faults where I’ve hurt the people I love. I’ve had to confront the parts of myself that I want to leave behind me, and though those moments are ugly, they have been the most significant. And I’m not sure if I should share it with the public.                      I’ve been putting off writing. This was meant to be at least three blogs. The classes I took fall and spring as two blogs to be published at the end of the respective semesters, the programs I did over IAP to be published at the end of IAP, a blog on how I’m not graduating this year to be published the day of graduation, and maybe one or two process blogs on a few things I’ve made. I had a plan for how and when I’d finish writing. The perfectionist in me wants to abandon it all. Why write about something that happened months ago? A ridiculous question to everyone but those with an all-or-nothing mindset. But this too, perfectionism, is something I’m trying to shed. I’ve done the first step of identifying the problem, so this blog is me reducing the points of resistance like worrying about the publishing window or length. So here it is, an amalgamation of little posts, something over nothing.  Fall 2021 Classes 4.053: Visual Communication Fundamentals When I signed up for this class, courseroad marked it as virtual, which helped push me past my hesitations about a 9 AM class (I am NOT a morning girlie despite my efforts). Come lecture day though, I learned that only the recitations, held Thursdays from 7-10 pm, were virtual while the lectures were not only in the morning but in the old MIT museum, an almost 25-minute walk from my dorm. I was a mess Tuesday mornings, but I’m glad I committed to the class. I learned a lot about graphic design, specifically typography, grid systems, and iteration. It opened my eyes to creative places to tap into for inspiration, and I became a lot more comfortable with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.         6.070: Electronics Project Laboratory I’ve always felt a gap in my computer science knowledge regarding the electrical engineering side of course 6. 6-9 doesn’t require any hardware classes, but I decided to take this course that covered the basics of circuitry. Honestly, the content was challenging for me even though the class was a half-unit course primarily for freshmen. I think I’m more of a bottom-up learner that tries to get to the root of the lesson and build up. But with topics like electricity, current, or voltage, I’ve found that the definitions are either circular or analogy-based which leaves me without a concrete understanding. I had to learn to put that desire aside and focus on the more hands-on aspects like wiring up breadboards each class. At the very least, this repetition helped me become more comfortable with looking at drawn circuits and translating to the breadboard. And the information I learned in this class become useful in my other classes in both the fall and spring.          9.72: Vision in Art and Neuroscience This is by far one of my favorite classes. The tagline of the course was ~perceiving perception~. The course was a critical investigation on the role of vision on a neural, computational, and artistic level. We discussed color, depth perception, visual processing, motion perception, and so much more. I have so many takeaways from this course but one of the main epiphanies is viewing experience as the object which has given me a new perspective on art and life. Watch the video below for a great profile of the course! 21W.755: Writng & Reading Short Stories The syllabus for this class was suspiciously chill. The professor told us that we weren’t required to share our work with him. In fact, he didn’t have any writing assignments besides short readings before class, and sending him an email with questions once during the semester. At first, I thought it was a gimmick or that he was just trying too hard to be a ~cool~ professor. Surprisingly, he kept his word, and even more surprising was seeing how even without strict rules and deadlines the class had purpose and structure. I grew to appreciate the trust the professor had for students to find their own motivations while also being a source of help should the need arise. I was hoping to take this class again the next semester, but we learned towards the end of the semester that this was his last term teaching, so I’m glad I happened to catch the last time I could take this class with him.  21W.771: Advanced Poetry Workshop This was actually the second time I took this class. I grew a lot as a poet and writer the first time I took it and wanted to continue that in the fall. Though the class structure remains the same, write a new poem for weekly workshops, the experience of this class is shaped entirely by your fellow classmates. I’m fortunate to have been surrounded by people with different perspectives and styles who have inspired and challenged me both times I took this class. We also read a couple of poetry collections and one book–Obit by Victoria Chang–immediately became one of my favorites. The book is an exploration of grief and is written in the form of a newspaper obituary. It’s inventive, moving, full of life and death. You must read it.   I’m not graduating this year When I was courseroading junior year, I realized that I had frontloaded most of my humanities classes and had a lot of my technical courses remaining. On paper, it was doable; I would take three technicals and one humanities course. Realistically, all semesters where I had taken more than two technicals I struggled to balance my work, and I’d either drop a class or have it marked as incomplete. We were also almost a year into the pandemic, and frankly, I was bitter that I had lost a year of college to virtual schooling. I knew people who were able to live together with their friends through the pandemic, and I felt so stagnant in comparison.  I knew upperclassmen who had taken an extra semester or more, and after speaking with a few, the idea of taking an additional semester or two started to seem like a reality. I spoke with my S3 dean, and she encouraged me to pursue it. Even my parents, who I thought would be against the idea, were supportive. I finally spoke with my financial aid officer, and she told me I had a good case. I definitely made the right decision for myself. I have the time to take some cool elective classes while completing my major at a rate that best suits me. I’ve developed many new friendships that I want to nurture before we go our separate ways after MIT. I’ve become more involved in various organizations at MIT. Still, I had many mixed feelings seeing my original class walk the stage at graduation. Shame that I wasn’t graduating ‘on time’. Sadness that many of my friends are leaving with no guarantee I’ll ever see them again. Happiness to see the most deserving people cross the finish line. Doubt that I made the right decision.  It’s been over a month since graduation, and I’ve calmed down. I’ve been asking our new alums their plans for maintaining friendships or community so I can inform my own. I’m surprised to report that many don’t have any. It’s inspired me to spend the last year wisely and intentionally to both develop long-lasting relationships as well as enjoy the ones I have for this season in my life. I want to spend the next year doing the things I wanted to do coming into MIT and told myself I couldn’t. More than anything I feel grateful that I have an additional chance to make the most out of MIT.  IAP I heavily underestimated my commitments this IAP. I was one of six MIT students participating in the MITandFIT program, an advanced fibers and fabrics two-week-long workshop. I also received a BCAP grant to work on a zine that features local POC-owned restaurants. My plan was as follows: the first two weeks of IAP I would spend the mornings and afternoons attending the MITandFIT workshops and the evenings taking photos of the food of the restaurants. Then the last two weeks of IAP would be spent editing photos and compiling the zine.  Little did I know the intensity of the workshop. The program is a collaborative effort that brings six students from MIT and six from FIT to work on interdisciplinary projects that incorporate design, tech, and fashion. We had lectures and workshops in the mornings through the afternoon and office hours in the evenings where we were expected to make progress on our project every day. My team and I would finish meetings past midnight and have presentations on our updates at 10 am the next day. It was like a two-week-long hackathon with an unbelievable amount of information squeezed in. I learned about fashion forecasting, textile properties, knitting and weaving techniques, conductive embroidery, 3D modeling, sensors, wearable tech, and SO much more. It opened a whole new world of what I can pursue as a career or interest.  So, for the first two weeks of IAP, my waking hours were almost entirely taken up by this program and I didn’t work on my zine. I was panic-calling restaurants entering the third week of IAP and had thankfully taken pictures of all the restaurants by the end of IAP. But that was only the beginning of the work; I still had to go through the photos, edit them, go through the interviews, compile the photos and text into a zine, and publish it. I enlisted the help of one of my friends for the layout and graphic design of the zine. But at this point, the spring semester had started, and after a few weeks, I struggled with balancing my coursework, club commitments, and this project. I decided to complete it over the summer and publish it in the fall.  Besides these two programs, one of the few memorable things I did was watch Euphoria with friends in my living group. We finished the first season in time for the release of the second and continued our weekly routine of dramatically reacting to each scene of every episode through the spring semester. Though season two doesn’t hold a candle to the first, I just loved taking a break and coming together every week.  Moments of creativity  My most important takeaway from the virtual semesters was that I am happiest when I’m releasing my creative energy in some way alongside working on classes. So my senior year I made a conscious effort to incorporate that at different levels. I took classes such as 9.72 and 3.173 where I had the chance to work on hands-on projects in art and textiles, 21W.755 and 21W.771 where I wrote poetry and prose, and 4.032 and 4.053 where I learned more about graphic and information design.  Previous Next I sought out creative endeavors in student organizations. I volunteered to host creative events such as a jewelry-making workshop and a fashion show for a banquet for the Black Women’s Alliance. I worked on multiple spreads for Infinite Magazine.     Previous Next Finally, I tried to be artistic in how I expressed myself through my clothes or makeup if not every day then at least on special occasions. I tried new things with my hair. I sewed my dress for senior ball. I started going thrifting more frequently.    Previous Next Spring 2022 Classes 3.173: Computing Fabrics When someone I knew told me about this class they were taking, I immediately dropped one class and replaced it with 3.173. The class was so enlightening in terms of the possibilities of integrating tech with fabrics. We learned how to use a knitting bed as well as various weaving techniques. We explored capacitive sensing and different ways to integrate wires into the fabric. And I got more practice with Arduino! A part of me is mad that I found out about the fashion and tech space at MIT so late in my time at MIT, but I’m at least grateful that I did. Like 9.72, the MIT News Office also did a profile of the class; take a look at all the cool things we did in class!   6.819: Advances in Computer Vision 26-100 is one of MIT’s biggest lecture halls, and I had never seen it packed to the brim as it was during the first lecture of the class. Admittedly, after the first few weeks, I stopped consistently attending lectures and just worked on the psets, so I don’t have as much to say about the experience of the class. 8.02: Physics II I put off taking 8.02 for the longest time because I failed 8.01 my freshman year and had a lot of fears about that. But taking 8.02 in the spring really proved to me how much I had grown as a student in terms of predicting where I would struggle and asking for help. And I found the content a lot more interesting than 8.01. The most important difference though was Mohammed and his legendary reviews. God Himself must have breathed the gift of teaching into his soul because I have never had any teacher explain concepts so clearly and succinctly. I grasped weeks of content within three hours. If it weren’t for him and his reviews, I would’ve failed 8.02 without a doubt.       4.032: Design: Info and Visualization I’ve always been interested in data visualizations, and the class was a great introduction to it. I got a lot of exposure to p5.js and processing, a graphical library for electronic art, design, and more. Everyone in the class came from different backgrounds and varying skill sets, so even just watching the different projects students worked on was informative. The assignments were simple and specific but with so much room for creativity, such as making a clock or a weather app. It encouraged me to look at the objects I interact with every day and reimagine them.  Summer 2022 I’m working remotely as a developer living in NYC this summer. I’m not in concrete-jungle Manhattan; my block won the greenest block in Brooklyn a few years ago, and I see my landlady hard at work gardening every day to win again this year. I didn’t expect calm in NYC. Most days I’m coding at my desk in this tranquil quiet interrupted by the welcome sounds of rustling trees or cars blasting dancehall music. There are at least two beauty supply stores and even more Caribbean restaurants on my street. Being around people who look like me makes me feel like I’m back home. Weekends in Manhattan are a refreshing change of pace. Everything feels faster; people, time, subway. Something is always moving at any point in your periphery. It’s exciting and exhilarating, feels like a coming-of-age movie (though I’m always happy to return to the stillness of my apartment at the end of the night).          The best and worst part of NYC is that there’s always something to do, somewhere to be, someone to see. It hasn’t helped that I ended up on the side of TikTok that shares (what’s probably only a fraction of) exhibit openings, pop-up markets, and the best brunch spots every weekend. Decision paralysis is real. And sometimes I just want to read a book or paint or sew. If there are a thousand alternate worlds where I spend a summer in NYC in a thousand different ways, I’m sure all versions of me would still be left wishing I’d done more. But I’m learning to accept that what will need to get done or be seen or be experienced will happen. That is what I’m doing this summer: finding peace.

This summer, I got a side gig to put up chalk art in the Welcome Center,  which opened last year Chalk art’s already a thing that you see a lot on campus (see:  MIT Chalk of the Day  Tim the Beaver on a skateboard, doing an ollie out of a giant fire behind him I slapped a π on the deck because I figured it would be on-brand for MIT. And there’s flames in the background! For no reason! “Where are you from?” Standard question, nothing too weird. The answers got me wondering how large of a range of places people are coming from to visit the Welcome Center (see: Week 3). Previous Next  Sailor Tim Right after I finished this, I remember thinking,  A few hours later, Kellen asked if I could draw Sailor Moon Tim so he could put it up on the MIT Admissions Instagram page before he left. Is it blessed or cursed? I can’t say for sure, but now it’s on the Insta page for everyone to see.

I usually alternate between a variety of alternative hip hop and indie rock/punk.

My favorite one is the alien. “Favorite book?” I just put up a generic prompt because I didn’t know what to put that day, but I was surprised by how much personality there was in the responsive people gave, even if they didn’t intend to do that. I really liked reading this person’s response in particular because it seemed like they put a lot of effort into their answer, despite the fact that it was going to get erased eventually. Really shows how much they wanted to share the books they enjoyed. “YES   is such a good series, but there are so many good books that I’ve read in the past year alone so it’s hard to decide, but some of my favorites include: Greg Egan’s books, the  series (starts with  ), the  series (starts with  ), the   series (starts with  ), and  … and this is just of the books I’ve read in the past year!”  OVERFLOW ERROR Just wanted to draw something silly and corny. “What do you do in your free time?” My favorite answers:

So the interesting part is that people were able to commit to building the maze from the start and the end, but the overall effort fell apart in the center. Somebody got bored and drew a face, and somebody else played two of the most scuffed Tic-Tac-Toe games that I’ve ever seen. Not to mention that someone changed, “If I can solve it, you owe me a million dollars” to “I can solve it, you owe me a million dollars.” Well played. I smell a cheater.  Cat person/Dog person? Early bird/Night owl? My hypothesis was that the data was going to skew towards the bottom two quadrants, but it was a lot more evenly distributed than I expected. Turns out that I’m just surrounded by night owls, so I put my bias into my assumption. There are also three people who wrote “Dog Person” instead of their own name.

People would draw Among Us crewmates on the boards all the time, so I wanted to manifest that energy.

Multiple layers of  . So instead, I added some amonguses to the board to make it look like different people drew them in passing (hence the different colors), so people would be encouraged to fill the board with amongus themselves. (As in “people,” I mostly mean Gen Z people.) However, my social experiment was halted prematurely. The next day, the board was turned around so the amonguses were hidden and the other side had “Where are you from?” written on it in pretty lettering. I don’t hold any hard feelings. It was too experimental and wasn’t a great prompt for visitors of all ages to interact with. But, I get to tell people that I drew Amonga Lisa for my job. That’s a win.

A lot of my time this summer has been spent in transit. I take the subway to and from work. I spend most of my free time wandering around the streets of NYC. I’ve made two weekend trips to and from Boston via the Amtrak train, and more recently a day trip to Providence, RI also via Amtrak. One day, it suddenly occurred to me that when I’m on a train, I could be doing something better than draining my cellular data and attention span on Instagram — I could be reading!  I’ve mentioned  before  I devoured the story of the Chinese American narrator figuring out her queerness in the setting of 1950’s San Francisco. My stomach churned her sorrow and joy and love until it thoroughly mixed with my own. I felt full.   During my Amtrak ride from NYC to Providence, I started reading  Stone Butch Blues as a pdf on my laptop. I finished the first quarter of the novel before my laptop died (and I had forgotten my charger). I was secretly relieved as the story was starting to settle inside of me like concrete; it was becoming very heavy and likely best consumed in multiple sittings rather than one. For the rest of the train ride, I just stared out of the window, letting myself take whatever train of thought arrived at my mind’s platform.  I like the sky. No matter how fast the train was whizzing by the trees of Connecticut and the harbors of Rhode Island, the sky’s infinity was steadfast and unbothered. The sky that day was not in a hurry: the clouds drifted lazily across the sky at an almost imperceptible pace. If I reflected upon the first half of my college experience by focusing on the trees and harbors, all I’d be able to see would be the hazy blur of frustration, panic, and exhaustion. But if I stepped back and looked at the sky instead, I could see progress.  My mind hopped on and off many trains, but this transit system coalesced into one major destination:  Progress usually entails something becoming better or stronger, like honing your skills or raising your self esteem. But right now, I think it’s progress just to realize this. Maybe it’s a glaringly obvious one, but it took me a lot of thought to fully believe it.   I’ve always loved art as a kid. Of course I loved making pretty things and drawing pretty pictures, I also loved to tell stories through illustrations and comics. As a high school junior trying to put together a supplemental art portfolio, I tried very hard to make art through which I was saying something “meaningful,” whether it be about my feelings, identities, or perspective on the world. Personal is probably the better word here than meaningful, since I don’t believe in there being such a thing as meaningless art. Trying to make   art required a lot of thinking and feeling. When I started MIT however, art became more of a temporary escape, a relatively brainless distraction from things that consumed me like psets and research. I just wanted to see pretty paintings of clouds instead of two column latex documents, so my art became less personal and more aesthetics-driven. Not that it’s a bad thing or that aesthetics-driven art is lesser than; I needed breaks and making impersonal art gave me those breaks. On the Amtrak, I realized that I basically never got such large swathes of time to feel and think deeply at MIT. When you’re in a constant state of hosedness, you tend to harden.  You literally don’t have time to cry. This fucking pset is due in an hour.  Maybe you’ll crystalize into a diamond, glittering with accomplishment. But more often than not, you realize that your diamond is actually just tempered glass, manufactured to be tough and sturdy and to have your tensions and compressions balancing each other out in the most delicate of equilibriums until just the tiniest crack shatters your entire self into a billion pieces.  That’s a very melodramatic recap of what last semester felt like.  This summer I think I’m finally sweeping up the pieces, hoping that I’ll be able to smooth them into  sea glass hides behind screens To clarify, I am not saying that screens and coding and art are mutually exclusive — all the DALL-E memes scream that they aren’t! I also think that working a conventional 9-5 job is valid as something to want for yourself. It’s an option that I’m considering for what I want to do straight out of college, but I just don’t see it as enough to (metaphorically) make me full in the same way that  he Telegraph Club  did. Neither am I trying to romanticize the life of an artist; your livelihood depending on a constant stream of creativity and feelings leaves you more prone to burnout.  Which leads to the fact that sometimes, feeling  hurts.  And suddenly my heart hurt so bad and I realized how long it’s been since my heart felt—anything. I’m grateful that I’ll likely never have to fully experience the immense pain narrated in  Stone Butch Blues,  but swallowing those words led to a reflux of some aches that I had long buried within myself. Some of those aches were from general MIT related burnout, but last semester made me realize beneath them laid some deeper issues. I’d only dig those out during the few therapy sessions I managed to schedule and rebury them as soon as my hour-long session was up. I had no idea that therapy would hurt, almost as much as the issues that made me go in the first place. I was told that’s how you know it’s working. Why must hurting be the prerequisite to healing? On the Amtrak, the aches left my mask soaked with tears, but it’s been a while since I last thought and felt this deeply. In Providence, I hung out with my high school friend who now attends art school. I’ve never seriously considered art school, but lately I’ve been thinking about what kind of person I would’ve been if I had gone to art school, or literally anywhere that’s not MIT. I don’t think I necessarily would’ve been happier, as I would’ve just had a different set of problems to deal with. But I’m fairly sure that I’d have more time to feel.  I can  make  more time to feel, despite all the expectations here to fill up your schedule with diamond-forming heat and pressure. I’ll punt more psets, take fewer classes. Unlike every semester I’ve been a student at MIT so far, I won’t UROP this coming fall. I’ll go outside more, even if it’s just to watch clouds inch across the sky. I’ll make art whose meaning stems from feeling. I’ll seek stories with the same determination I’ve sought out source code. Gradually, because passion thrives on feeling, I’ll regain my passion for science that drew me to MIT in the first place.  Before hopping on the return Amtrak to NYC, I bought a copy of  On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous I’m in a touchy feely, sad boi hours kinda mood,” I told my friend who I had dragged to the bookstore.  I threw myself into yet another excruciatingly heavy story, whose prose lodged in my throat as jagged shards. But bit by bit, they blurred into beautiful sea glass the color of trees and harbors, until I felt as full as the brilliant strokes of clouds brushed bold across the setting sky.

I’ve spent most of this summer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, staying in Women’s Independent Living Group (WILG).  These past few days, the heat wave has made even walking outdoors feel like swimming through a dryer. The ends of my hair have withered and splintered, and my face has broken out terribly due to an unfortunate combination of sunscreen and perspiration. I am probably not made for temperatures higher than eighty degrees Fahrenheit. Still, it’s my first summer spent almost completely in New England, and while the weather leaves much to be desired, there is still a lot of beauty to be found here. The sunshine drenches everything in ethereal paleness. People carry themselves more loosely now. Sometimes I can’t find a BlueBike because they’ve been all claimed, but even when that happens, I’m not upset, because it means others are experiencing the joy of sailing down the street with the wind at their backs. (It’s easier to be generous when I’m not rushing to class.) Here’s what I’m doing this summer: In January of this year, my summer internship decisions came down to two companies, one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and one in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the time, it wasn’t clear if these internships would be in-person or remote. I knew that I could stay at WILG if I interned in Cambridge, but I’d have to search for housing in San Francisco. Also, I knew some people who’d interned at the Cambridge company in the past. So I decided to join  Kensho My younger brother recently became chief-of-staff at a startup in the  Web 3.0  I’m counting this as my third job since I do get paid (in the form of subsidized rent). I’m a house manager for WILG, which means I assign chores and do other tasks required to keep our house running. It turns out a  can go wrong in a house! I need to get credit for 18.03, Differential Equations, for my math major. I’d rather not take the class, so I’m sitting for the Advanced Standing Exam (ASE) in September. The 18.03 ASE comes with a very long homework packet, which I need to . . . start. . . I’m enrolled in Alternative Explorations of Drawing (Advanced), which is a weekly drawing class offered through the MIT Student Art Association. I haven’t drawn much in the last few years, but there’s something very soothing about charcoal darkening my palms, the conversation I have with the piece of paper in front of me and nobody else. I’ve been catching up on all the reading I haven’t gotten to do during the school year. So far, I’ve read  by Sally Rooney,  by Jenny Offill,  by Hanya Yanagihara, and I started  by Elif Batuman but I’m not sure if I’ll finish it, so I’ve moved on to  by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I watched all of  season 4 and I’m getting through  right now. Several weeks ago, I saw the new  movie. I’m trying to avoid watching too much television, as my schedule is already quite full. with Anj F. ’22. he hadn’t seen Despicable Me before so he was very confused about what language the minions speak       I’ve still been working with Simon & Schuster for the two YA novels I’m under contract for. I’m also collaborating on something with one of my best friends, Steven T. ’20. It’s been my dream for a while to do a graphic novel as well, but given all of my other obligations, I don’t know when I’ll have time to do such a time-intensive project. Also, fellow blogger Alan Z. ’23 is running a weekly poetry group that I’m involved in! I went back home to Portland for a few weeks at the end of the school year to see my family, and then I went down to Los Angeles in June for a reunion with some friends I lived with last year. Earlier this month, I got invited to a yacht party in New York City so I visited, and then the next weekend I had another reunion in the Big Apple with the tech-for-good program I was involved in last summer, so I went down again. The last few years, the same question has pressed into me from all sides:  Do I want a life where I’m a software engineer at an established company? Do I want a life where I’m wearing many hats at somewhere early-stage? Do I want a life where I read and write and draw? Sylvia Plath and her  famous fig tree. love on the side,” but I don’t know how to explain to them is that what I  love is obsessing over something and giving all of myself to it. In January 2020, I built a web app with my two friends; we pulled twelve-hour days for weeks. It was all I could think about. I loved my teammates so much, I loved what we were making. I’ve been searching for that sort of happiness ever since.

As I’ve  talked about several times I guess that sounds odd; after all, isn’t the point of a software engineering internship to learn software engineering? Well, yes. But to be honest, coming into the internship, I wasn’t sure what there was left to  . I didn’t have a good idea of what separates a junior from a senior developer. Part of that was pride, and the other part was ignorance. Sure, I was familiar with the different programming languages used, popular libraries and frameworks, revision control, design principles, testing and debugging, developer tools. And I understood the importance of well-organized code that is
 
easy to understand, ready for change, and safe from bugs. ⁠ 01 Shoutout to 6.1020 Elements of Software Construction (old number 6.031). I knew I lacked experience in the “soft skills” department, but this post isn’t about that. It’s about the hard skills I wasn’t good at because  . And now that I think about all the things I don’t know, and the possibility of   unknown unknowns, and I can understand why software engineering is a career. Let’s say we’re having a conversation. What happens is that: When we have a conversation, we don’t think about all those details. We don’t think about moving our tongue, we don’t recall the definition of each word. A conversation isn’t a series of sounds, words, or sentences: it’s   going back and forth. And when we work on the level of ideas, we can   the lower details away. Frontend development is also one abstraction on top of another. You need to know the programming language you’re using, then whatever libraries and frameworks you’re using, and even those depend on each other. For example, in our codebase we use  Redux Toolkit Redux React 
large, complicated state. ⁠ 02 The <em>state</em> of a website is all the data it has. The state for Twitter's website includes the tweets you're viewing, their likes and retweets, their author and the link to their profile picture, the date the tweet was posted, and lots of other stuff. Web apps like Twitter tend to have a lot of state. Abstractions help, but you still need to  load them in your head Let’s go back to the conversation example. Consider three English speakers learning Spanish, of different familiarities: . . . The three speakers—Alice, Bob, and Carol—all think in different   or   of Spanish. Going down levels is necessary sometimes, like how Bob has to think about hard words, or how Carol might take a moment to understand complex sentences. And it’s not as if Alice can’t say sentences or convey ideas, but it’s going to take her more time than it would Carol. Alice is only fast enough to keep up with words, while Carol can keep with ideas. Each person has some highest level that they can work with quickly and comfortably. Let’s call that their  . Part of becoming a better programmer is raising my abstraction level. When I started out my internship, I was unfamiliar with Redux Toolkit. To do   with the state, I had to think about  useDispatch useSelector createAction createReducer As I talked about in  The joys of web development I feel so powerful learning how to do more things. It feels like power to SSH somewhere and not feel completely lost. It feels like power when it took weeks to understand the first programming language, but hours to understand the tenth. I think this feeling of “learning how to do more things” isn’t just about learning more things, but about raising my abstraction level. If all I learned was how to use frontend library number twelve, without feeling like I’m doing anything  , then it doesn’t feel like learning power, but like memorizing facts. A good tool is one that gives good abstractions, one that   details, not adds more. Another reason abstraction levels matter is scope. The higher your abstraction level is, the larger your work can be. Five-paragraph essays are at the   level, where each paragraph has a specified role, like an introduction or conclusion. Research articles are at the   level, with sections like related work or methodology. A book is at the   level, each chapter having sections of its own. To a person who’s only comfortable with paragraphs, writing a book seems daunting. But once you’re comfortable with chapters, you can put several chapters together to make a book. My internship was structured as a series of projects, and I was given lots of latitude to plan each one. I learned how to take a big feature, like, say, adding operations to a group of files rather than a single file. What features do we   to add, what features are nice to have? Why do users want these features? I think this is called  , the phase of defining the requirements and judging how important they are. Then I planned the technical changes. I needed a new backend endpoint, I needed to add checkboxes and their state, then I needed to add buttons that call the new endpoint. Then I planned the implementation of the new endpoint: what’s the logic? How is it different from the existing one? What are the options for implementation, what are the trade-offs with each option? By breaking it down into parts and planning each one, I’d turned a big feature into a series of small tasks. How small do the tasks need to be? I only needed to break down the task to the level of my highest abstraction level, I guess. For example, I didn’t have to break down the state management into how I’d call the Redux Toolkit functions, because I was comfortable with that level. But I had to break down the endpoint implementation into smaller parts, like how I’d schedule tasks and run them in parallel, because I wasn’t as familiar with the backend. I could imagine that, if my abstraction level for working with the backend was higher, I’d have needed less planning and less time to write that part. This kind of thinking—I’ve heard it called  computational thinking eating an elephant one bite at a time I like to think of planning a project as  going up the ladder of abstraction  the ladder, is also important. When something doesn’t work the way you expect it to, you have to go down the ladder and see what’s wrong. 
For example, ⁠ 03 This is a pretty technical example; feel free to skip to the bullet points at the end of this section. I used  Redux DevTools  collapsed. Using the browser devtools, I saw it only   like it was collapsed because it was behind the file in front of it. After reading the code, I settled on investigating  react-virtualized’s List . In other words, I   for what List did. I then had to read the source code for List to figure out what was going wrong. After ruling out several possibilities, I concluded that it wasn’t recomputing the layout when it needed to. Why wasn’t it redoing the layout? Again, I made several guesses, none of them correct. After reading more source code, I realized where my abstraction was wrong. The default renderer  uses indexes as a key the layout of a file  why the new file was in the wrong place: it was in the place of the old file at that index! Investigations like these made me realize a few things: All abstractions fail single-shot debug , rather than starting with an abstraction and seeing what depends on it. React DevTools Chrome DevTools Firefox DevTools GitHub Copilot . Because so much time is spent reading code, it’s more important for a programming language to be easy to read than it is to be  easy to write There’s this field of knowledge that I don’t know a good name for, but the closest thing is
 
“programming principles” ⁠ 04 This is taking a page from <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoProverbs">go proverbs</a>, which is kind of what I’m going for. Zen of Python a Ruby on Rails conference talk A Philosophy of Software Design the ninety-ninety rule two hard things  theory and   it are different skills. In a conversation I had with a coworker, we talked about online competitive Tetris, and “openers” and “garbage” and “the meta”. Later he looked me up on some Tetris websites, and discovered that I only have a few hours of experience playing Tetris. He then told me, and this is a direct quote, “lol yes you know way more theory than your stats show”. This isn’t only a Tetris thing. I can recite lots of go proverbs, but I’m only
 
13 kyu on OGS. ⁠ 05 Wikipedia categorizes me as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings">casual player</a>. I one day dream to become single-digit kyu. When I   recognize theory, though, it feels so satisfying. For example, when I was implementing the deletion mentioned earlier, there was some existing code that did something similar. There was the code that added files, and the code that saved files. I thought about whether I could take out the common logic between adding, saving, and deleting. I decided not to, following the principle of “prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction”. It turned out to be the right call, because the deleting logic soon became different. As another example, I recently helped migrate our TypeScript codebase to use  strict null checks did nothing gracefully The people I’ve met at the company are a lot like the people I’ve met in MIT: they’re  brilliant grounded relatable “the people” Being around such cool people makes me want to get better. I want to be a better person, someone who’s humble, and kind, and knows how to listen. I want to be a better coworker, someone who’s a joy to work with and be around. And I want to become a better programmer: , because I think this is the most important unsolved problem in the field. I want to close with a song from Bleachers,  I Wanna Get Better . I have   ahead of me that I can dedicate to becoming better, and I know that still, it would not be enough. I wanna get better. That’s it. That’s what I want in my life.

All opinions stated are my own. From the Too Good To Go (TGTG) website:  We dream of a planet with no food waste, and every day we’re working on making that a reality. Our app is the most direct way for you to get involved – just download, log on, and get saving perfectly good, surplus food from your local stores. It’s always a surprise and an instant good deed for the planet.  How it works is that participating stores list surplus meals, you use the app to reserve and pay for meals, and then you pick up your meal at a specified time window, usually right before closing hours. Meals listed on TGTG are supposed to be at most ⅓ of the retail price — i.e. if you pay $4 for a TGTG meal, the food should be worth $12 or more. Who doesn’t love a good bargain! Listings are a surprise; you won’t know what you’ll get until you pick it up. As someone who hasn’t changed their Chipotle order in years, I appreciate how TGTG has encouraged me to try things I wouldn’t have voluntarily ordered, like roasted eggplant sauce in Cava bowls. Unfortunately, that means it’s risky to buy from TGTG if you’re deathly allergic to anything.  Because listings can sell out quickly and pickup hours/locations can be inconvenient, you probably shouldn’t rely on TGTG as your sole source of sustenance. On that note, here’s a gentle reminder that TGTG serves not only MIT students, but the entire Boston/Cambridge community. By no means should you feel

 recently i was thinking about my relationship with other people both in the context of writing a blog and in the context of being a friend. i was pretty confused, so i asked on  twitter :  “a dilemma I’m currently thinking through – when I write (or do any other public work), how much do I care about changing other peoples’ minds vs focusing solely on personal expression and craft? people often say you can’t/shouldn’t try to change others. i think that’s very reasonable- other peoples’ choices are out of your control, so it doesn’t make sense to put too much weight on their decisions. doing so can be exhausting and bring lots of emotional pain on the other hand: advertising works. recruiting works. activism works. these fields are built around the premise that you can change the people around you, often in significant and long-lasting ways how do people in these areas reconcile “not being able to change other people” with the fact that their work literally depends on it? when should i try to influence my friends’ decisions? when is it within my right to do so? how do i deal with the disappointment that comes when a friend makes a choice that i think is obviously wrong?” in other words, most of my interactions with other people come either from us being friends or from them reading content i write, and i wasn’t sure how much i cared about actively being a positive influence and shaping other people vs just doing my own thing and not worrying about my impact on others ii . at some point during the pandemic i was introduced to stoicism. one of its main premises is that we can only control ourselves; external factors like other people and current events and the weather are beyond our control, so wishing for specific outcomes from these things inevitably leads to disappointment and therefore we should not concern ourselves with them. instead we should focus on maximizing our own thoughts and actions, the only things we actually have power over. this is illustrated in quotes like the following one from  meditations , which i’ve written about before:  “Start praying like this and you’ll see: Not ‘some way to sleep with her’ – but a way to stop wanting to. Not ‘some way to get rid of him’ – but a way to stop trying. Not ‘some way to save my child’ – but a way to lose your fear.” i think it’s important to note that this stance is primarily a defensive one – it doesn’t actually reveal how to accomplish anything you want, but rather explains how to avoid unnecessary suffering and how to protect your own well-being. this is one of the reasons i was initially drawn to stoicism – at the time i was suffering from a lot of social anxiety, insecurity about my competence, and various other problems of my own making. so what i needed then was an ideology to ground myself and stop my mind from wandering, and i am grateful to stoicism for providing that iii . one of my friends saw my tweets and disagreed with the assumptions i’d made.  i don’t think recruiters are actually emotionally invested in convincing any of their targets to join a company , they said.  their job isn’t to change your mind as much as it is to flood your brain with positive information about a subject you might not have thought critically about before in hindsight this makes a lot of sense: if recruiters were actually attached to every candidate they wanted to hire, most of them would probably burn out within a few months. conversations with good recruiters might feel like targeted emotional messaging, but that doesn’t imply they care about you; it could just mean they’re very effective at delivering customized information. i think this distinction is similar to the difference between persuasive writing and biased expository writing – it’s easy to mistake the latter for the former if you’re not reading carefully, but they originate from very different mentalities. in my experience, producing persuasive writing requires thinking much more carefully about the reader than producing biased expository writing does if you accept this view on recruiting and writing, then maybe maximizing impact on others actually has very little to do with how much you care about or understand the people around you. maybe it’s actually about developing the most efficient and scalable systems for outreach and projection. and maybe that also means impact maximization isn’t as humane or benevolent of a goal as it’s often made out to be iv . of course, the problem with believing external events are out of your control is that this belief is often self-fulfilling. for instance: you see your friend making bad choices, you tell yourself that your friend’s behavior is beyond your control, and as a result you decide not to explain to your friend how they’re being dumb, thereby ensuring you have no say in your friend’s decisions (i think the stoic counterargument here would be something like: you can’t control what your friend does, but you can control how good of a friend you are, so you should tell your friend anyway because that’s what a good friend would do. but arguments like these manage an extremely delicate balance between involvement / responsibility / control / attachment that i think is too difficult to navigate in practice) in other words: delineating the things you can and can’t control, and then letting go of the latter, can become very limiting. sometimes it’s important to believe you can control things even when that’s not strictly true  the other day i was thinking about basketball and i realized that being a committed sports fan basically means you consent to adding a random number to your happiness level each week that’s not necessarily a bad thing; it just means you’ve agreed to increasing the variance in your mood for some reason. maybe you actually like chaos, or maybe you’ve decided the camaraderie or sense of community or whatever else you get from following sports is worth the extra uncertainty this is true for everything else in the world as well. caring about external events means adding randomness to your mood; variance can only increase when you add independent random variables and different facets of life are usually pretty close to independent, so deciding to care about more things is akin to allowing the world to dictate more of your emotional state  one concept that’s become popular among my friends recently is that  all advice is directional . the meaning of the phrase: advice often takes the form “you should do X, because it will produce Y outcome in your life”. eg. “you should exercise to become more fit” or “you should speak up so people take you more seriously”. this type of statement is rarely universally applicable though – usually, when people say it, what they really mean is “if you do X more often, it will produce more of Y outcome in your life. you seem to be lacking Y in your life, so i think you should do X more often; however, if someone had too much of Y in their life, i would suggest that they do X less often”. in other words, advice is often phrased as a suggestion to perform an action, but it is more accurate to interpret the advice as highlighting a relationship between an action and an outcome, and this relationship can go in either direction applying this principle to the ideas of control and attachment, we can similarly transform them from absolute statements into directional ones. specifically: people who are currently struggling with mental health might benefit from reducing the extent to which they care about the external world, so that they can better manage their own emotional state; however, for people who currently feel stable enough to weather more emotional turbulence, they might actually benefit from caring more about things they can’t control all of which is to say that i feel better than i did last year. i feel like i can afford to care more about other people and about problems that are not my own. if i ever feel overwhelmed i can always withdraw back into myself again, but for now everything actually feels alright

As I’ve mentioned previously, I’m doing MISTI-Germany this summer and living in Berlin. MISTI is a really cool program that gives MIT students support to live and work abroad for a summer or a semester, without worrying too much about certain logistical aspects. I’ve always known that I would want to do MISTI; in fact, I was set to do it last summer, but things didn’t work out because of covid. I chose Germany because of my long-running interest in the country and its culture, as well as because, of all the languages I speak, German is the one that needs the most practice. I also wanted to spend a summer in Berlin specifically – it’s a very unique city with a character that appeals to me immensely. So, this summer I’m doing research at the meteorology institute of the Freie Universität Berlin and exploring the city in my free time. This blog is meant to be a slice of my life: I kept track of everything I did last Friday, and present it here for your enjoyment. I wake up at an ungodly early hour. Usually, I’ll get up around 8:30 – 9 AM, but today, I have some urgent tasks I need to finish before going in to work. Every Friday, my research group has a big meeting to discuss our progress, often with one or two presentations by individual members of the group to share what they’ve been working on. This Friday, it’s my turn to present the progress I’ve made in the
 
month ⁠ 01 how has the time passed??

“lunch”, ⁠ 03 three apricots and the leftovers of one of those meal replacement shakes from the previous day… yes I’m doing fine why do you ask My commute to the institute is honestly a little gross. First, I need to catch a bus, which stops across the street from my apartment. Sometimes, I get lucky and I only wait for a couple minutes; other days, it can be ten to fifteen minutes of standing at the stop. Generally, though, the bus runs really well, and the vehicles themselves are nice and new. I take the bus for about twenty minutes, then get off where the route intersects with a suburban-bound
 
train line. ⁠ 04 the S-Bahn, these trains run above ground, in contrast with the U-Bahn, which runs underground 
main campus. ⁠ 05 I suppose I probably should before I leave Previous Next my breakfast… On the way to the institute, I pick up a pastry for breakfast. I do this most mornings when I commute, so I cycle through the different pastries I like. Today I’m feeling a “quarktasche”, which consists of salty flaky dough filled with sweet cottage cheese. I’ve also brought a coffee drink thing
 
from home. ⁠ 06 I stock up at the supermarket, it’s cheaper than buying a latte every day, though not cheaper than not having a caffeine addiction altogether At 10, I head over to the meeting room. I’m presenting second, which I don’t mind. The first presentation is by an undergrad meteorology student, whose senior thesis is focused on analyzing data from a new crowd-sourcing initiative by
 
the DWD. ⁠ 07 the German weather service After the first presentation is over, it’s my turn to present. I’m a little nervous, since I haven’t had time to run through it fully. Usually, I prepare much more for presentations, it’s just that this week my work got away from me. Plus, the presentation is meant to be an informal progress report: intended more so to solicit advice than to deliver
 
results. ⁠ 08 because I don’t have results oops as you can see, my project is going swimmingly The problem is, I’m beginning to suspect that the machine learning approach is overkill for the problem and datasets at hand. In the month that I’ve been wrestling with the problem, I haven’t been having a lot of luck with getting the model to produce a useful result. To make things even harder, the group I am working with is the “statistical meteorology working group,” meaning they focus on statistical methods exclusively. I was brought in as a sort of external machine learning “expert”, to see what I could do with their existing data. Now, I’m very far from an expert in machine learning. I’m not inexperienced, by any means, I’ve been doing ML-related research for a while now, and I took
 
6.036 ⁠ 09 intro to machine learning, now called 6.3900 I mention all of this, in different words, during my presentation. I describe every idea I’ve tried, and the ways in which it has failed, and then present the approaches I’m in the middle of implementing. The presentation goes well, especially given how last minute I prepared it, and the discussion period that follows it is very productive. I am reminded of why I like science so much: I really enjoy bouncing ideas around, seeing everyone’s different approaches to problem solving, and trying to piece together a solution to the question at hand. I walk away from the meeting with a page-long list in my research notebook of things to try in an effort to get the model to work. my lunch. I thought this photo was really funny. I only got like two pages of reading done but that doesn’t matter After the meeting, I go back to my
 
office ⁠ 10 I say office, it’s just a room with a bunch of computers that I’ve been using as an office since it’s not needed in the summer 
from home. ⁠ 11 since the commute is so annoying After spending an unfortunate amount of time scrolling on Instagram, I get back to work. I take stock of the morning’s discussions and sort out my list of things to try for the model. It’s a good list, and it gets me excited for work on Monday, but I don’t really feel like starting any of the items now because none of them are very quick. I have a meeting set with my supervisor for 2 PM, so I poke around my data a little bit while I wait. Previous Next The meeting with my supervisor goes well. We mostly go over the morning’s meeting, and he helps me make adjustments to the list of things to try. We also talk about my goals for the rest of the internship, and the logistical details of the end of the summer. Turns out, he’s going to be on vacation for the last two weeks of my internship, so I’ll probably end up giving my final presentation remotely at a later date. After leaving the meeting, I finish up the data-poking I had started after lunch. I decide that, even if I stay at work until 5 PM, I’m not going to be productive for the rest of the day, so I might as well head home. I’ve generally found, in all the internships that I’ve done, that research has a very relaxed approach to working hours. No one keeps close track of when I work, with the expectation that I’ll get all my tasks done and make progress, just at a time convenient to me. It’s true – all the scientists I know work odd hours, though this is also particularly a function of the

I personally struggle with this feeling a fair amount, but it is one I think I can learn to live with and manage in a healthy manner. more commuter views from my way home I consider stopping by somewhere on the way home, just for fun – a bookshop or a café or something, but decide against it. Amber is coming to visit for the weekend, and her plane lands at 5:30 PM, so I want to clean up the mess that is my apartment before she gets there. I also need to do my laundry, or I’ll have nothing to wear in the evening. So, I head directly home,
 
reading ⁠ 13 I have the Murderbot Diaries series downloaded as ebooks, and it's perfect commuter reading When I get home, I vegetate for a while on my couch, scroll through Instagram, and respond to texts. Commuting is honestly so exhausting, and I can’t imagine having to do it every day. I’m glad I’m learning this now. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to get up from the couch and embark on a cleaning spree. I pick up the things I have strewn around my room, get the laundry going, then go to take a shower. As I wait for Amber to get from the airport to my apartment, I start cooking dinner. I have a number of ingredients that I feel are on the border of going bad, so I just make something that incorporates them all: fried potatoes, sauteed mushrooms with yogurt, braised cabbage, and some eggs for added protein. I’m trying out my mom’s braised cabbage recipe for the first time, so I’m a little nervous that I’m going to mess it up, but it goes pretty well. For the mushrooms, I had found fresh chanterelle mushrooms being sold in my local grocery store, and immediately knew I had to get them. I have fond memories of my grandfather, back in Russia, bringing back baskets full of chanterelles from his mushroom-picking expeditions in the woods near our house. I’ve never seen them sold fresh in the US, though there’s a good chance I just don’t know where to look. As I cook, I put on the next episode of the new Star Trek show, which has lately been bringing me a lot of joy. Previous Next After some delays with her flight and getting to my place, Amber finally arrives. I haven’t seen her since the end of the semester, so it’s a long-awaited reunion. I’m also really excited to show her Berlin and all the parts of it that I’ve been falling in love with. We eat dinner and catch up, then make plans for what to do for the rest of the night. I decide that we should go to the East Side Gallery, which is a kilometer-long section of the Berlin wall that has been preserved and covered in murals. I think, of all the tourist-y sites in Berlin, this one is particularly worth seeing, just because the murals are so cool and beautiful while also carrying a lot of meaning and history. Amber and I walk through the “gallery” and wander around a little around the area. We don’t stay for too long, since we have plans to meet Nanako K. ’25, who is also doing MISTI in Berlin, at a bar around 10 PM. Previous Next We get back to my apartment and start getting ready for the night. We have plans to meet Nanako, go to a bar for a bit, then head over to a dance club for the rest of the night. Amber and I are both chronically late to things, and Nanako generally isn’t, so I make an effort to try to be speedy in my getting ready. We still leave too late to be on time, but that’s okay. The bar doesn’t quite pan out, so we decide to just grab something from a “späti” – a little corner store that carries convenience items like snacks and drinks – and sit outside. The shopkeeper asks me where we’re from, and I say we’re from the US. He tells me that he gets a lot of Americans in his shop, because, if I understand this correctly, the CIA has an academy nearby for new recruits to perfect their German. Why not. The weather is lovely, and Nanako, Amber, and I sit outside the späti and enjoy the night, before heading over to the club. Amber in Berlin! Berlin is known for its vibrant nightlife scene, and particularly for its techno clubs. I’ve never been particularly into techno or any other electronic music, but in Berlin, it makes a lot of sense. The clubs are great, the vibes are good, and dancing to techno with a big crowd is really fun. Tonight, we end up at a club I haven’t been to yet. It’s alright – it turns out to be a slightly older crowd than we’re used to, but there’s some young people mixed in, and the whole place carries a very unique character. We leave earlier than I typically would, but everyone has had long days, and the lack of sleep from the previous night is definitely hitting me. Amber and I part ways with Nanako, and I ask her to text me when she gets home. As we leave, I promise Amber that tomorrow we’ll go to a different club, one of my favorites, and it’ll be an even better experience. We’re back at my place and in bed by 1:30, ready to sleep in and go out into the city again tomorrow.

I’ve been taking the time to explore some classes and activities in Copenhagen that I haven’t tried in a while. I took a pole class, a week of krav maga, and did art with some coworkers! pole I’ve tried out the stripper pole on Florey a couple times, but despite living in East Campus for a year, I never practiced all that much. Maybe a class would catalyze my learning? I found a studio in central Copenhagen and took a trial class. Super fun! I worked on a combo  that I’d seen on YouTube and learned some new spins. Then we learned inversions on the first day! It was wild because my logic approaching inversions had been based off of trapeze, where you have something horizontal to hold on to, which makes holding yourself up far easier. I thought the issue at hand was my grip strength. However— there’s a totally different logic around pole, where you hold yourself up with your legs and body, keeping friction between yourself and the pole. The emphasis on core strength is, if anything, greater than in trapeze. It’s fun going between different aerial apparatus, feeling the way each one moves, and how your body must move around them.  I managed the inversion, rather gracelessly. After fifty minutes, my old calluses were peeling, and my sides were red from sliding down the pole. The class was on Wednesday, and my hands were absolutely destroyed until Sunday, or maybe Monday. This was sort of
 
annoying. ⁠ 01 provided some content for poetry writing, though, so there's that So I haven’t gone back yet, but maybe I will. The studio was in a super cute neighborhood in the middle of Copenhagen, dotted with c They have week-long free trials! So of course I took six classes in one week. Then I went ‘n’ had a lotta thoughts and present to you many of them: I did jiu jitsu for a minute back in high school. My studio focused almost entirely on grappling and floor work. Not long after I started, the fight scenes I wrote shifted from sword and knife fights to grappling. I felt that I was grasping the arc of a fight, where everything happens rapidly and you don’t have a blow-by-blow, you just know you tried to get your leg somewhere and now you’re on top of someone; or  they  did something and now your arm is twisting backwards at a concerning angle. I was enthused with one particular leg choke.  This is all well and good, but it has occurred to me once or twice that if I, like all 5 feet and 115 pounds of me, were to get in a fight, the last thing I’d want is for it to go to the
 
ground. ⁠ 02 Probably. I mean that leg choke is pretty effective. Enter krav maga! I’ve heard it described on the internet as “artless and brutally effective.” I like that.  I came in and smiled a lot, which is neither what you do in Denmark nor what you do in a fight class. Everyone looked confused. Then we paired up to fight, and people were pretty chill. My partners with more experience correct my form. They say when they’ve messed something up, too. We give each other feedback — ‘you’re not quite crushing my windpipe yet, move your elbow to the right, there—ack…’ In this sort of environment, feedback is actually super helpful. You can’t always feel how effective your chokes are, but the other person can tell you. Generally in classes like this, you warm up, then learn a new technique, with different variations or defenses against it. You and your partner take turns practicing on each other. At the end, if you’re lucky, there’s a quick round of sparring. We didn’t always do that — for example in a beginner class where we’d just learned roundhouse kicks — but it was quite fun when we did. “You’re tougher than you look,” the instructor told me, after I’d been beaten up like four times in a row. My hair was falling from its tail, my face and arms were slick with sweat. I cocked my head at him, as if to say, I don’t look tough to you? After the initial class, I seem to have acquired a new brand of imposter syndrome. I didn’t realize my kicks were landing with any degree of force until I noticed my partner stumble when I kicked the mat he held. In a round of sparring, I brought this tall dude to his knees and shrugged it off, like, eh, he probably wasn’t trying. Then in the same class I knocked down a different guy and decided he probably wasn’t trying, either. I often asked if a practice move, particularly a choke, was ok; the most common response I got was “yeah, go ahead, I can take it.” Which makes sense, given that we were all showing up for a fighting class. It was also in a way the most respectful answer, different from “oh, go ahead, you couldn’t hurt me.” I appreciated that. I also learned some new kicks! It was actually so fun. I went to three intro classes that were all practicing roundhouse kicks, among others. For the first class, my roundhouse was terrible; I couldn’t figure out the pivoting on one leg part at all. And then, somehow, it got better. Way better. I feel like if I keep practicing, I could get to the point where I’d actually want to use it in a fight without worrying that I’d lose my balance.  My second novel skill is hitting things. I’ve always known   to punch — someone told me the don’t-make-a-fist-over-your-thumb rule early on — but I’ve not been too confident in being able to hit something effectively. I wasn’t sure why — like it was supposed to hurt, right? I actually was not sure, because often that question is answered with ‘no, why, does it?’  
However, ⁠ 03 maybe this is obvious to some people is  supposed to hurt! You practice with boxing gloves! So we practiced with boxing gloves and it didn’t hurt that much, like less than a dozen other daily things. And that made me real happy, though also mildly sad, but only in the midlife crisis period after class because during the class I was all ‘whoo punching things is fun!!’ I’ve talked to a friend with a black belt in karate who always says seriously that in an actual fight, your best bet is to run. She’s right.  Self-defense classes are meant to teach you to fend off an attack so that you can safely exit the situation. We warm up by trying to score touches on our partner’s shoulders and knees. It takes a lot of bouncing around. They have longer reach than me, so I’ve gotta jump in to land a hit. You need quick reaction times to fend off your partner’s attacks. My first class I scored zero touches. By my sixth class, I was matching my partners pretty equally.  Which is to say, this class is teaching me new fighting instincts, and I think that is the main goal. I doubt I’ll have time to pursue krav maga or other martial arts during MIT, but I plan to keep taking classes during the summer. It was hella inspiring to watch myself improve in just six classes, and I’m excited to see that arc over the next month and some. By the end of this, my characters will be punching and kicking each other instead of wrestling on the floor. A corrosion chemist, Mahla, and senior process engineer, Ivanna, and I all met up to draw after work. They are both brilliant, the sort of wildly accomplished women I look up to and feel mildly intimidated by. Mahla is a trained artist whose work has been displayed at shows, and she gave Ivanna and me pointers for our work. It was quite relaxing, sitting up on the terrace above our office, sketching the graffitied brick building across the street.   Clockwise from right: Ivanna’s Sailor Moon art, Mahla’s portrait, and my funky landscape It strikes me sometimes that this could be it. I could do this forever, or for the next handful of years. I’ve been trying to find a balance between group activities and deeper interactions with fewer people; between socializing and working on personal goals. It seems always that there is so much to be done. Despite being in a new country, I’ve had good luck with the former balance. My company and the MISTI cohort have proved to be lovely communities. I’m not sure how to balance the latter. The week of krav maga felt like taking time out to focus on me, to stabilize my workout routine. I enjoyed it immensely, but also felt the shift, and knew I would shift again toward socializing in the coming weeks. All in all, I’ve been enjoying the summer, exploring new skills and different sides of myself. Sometimes taking time away from MIT reminds me how to be human.

This past weekend, I had two high school friends, Kenneth and Ethan, come visit me. They’re probably the closest people I had to best friends in my senior year after my other friend group split. Ethan, who has been my friend for the past thirteen years, came and spent the weekend at my apartment. It was bizarre in a way because there was a part of it that felt so blatantly grown, adultish. Hosting an old friend at my one bed one bath apartment in San Francisco. Taking him around the city and covering his meals and Lyft costs with my money from my fancy tech job. Being able to constantly stride around the city like I knew it so well. Hopping on and off public transit with ease. This felt like the kind of stuff that real adults do. And here I was doing it. Ethan spent the day lounging in my work office as I finished work. When it came to a close, I felt a bundle of knots in my stomach and I braced myself because it’s almost time. Almost time to see Kenneth. I hadn’t seen Kenneth in a while. It’d been maybe a year since we’d spent time together, but we barely texted. We didn’t call. And it felt strange to see someone who I had valued so deeply in my life fade into an acquaintance. All throughout high school, I felt like Kenneth took care of me and really looked after me. We bickered like siblings (or how I imagine siblings fight, I’m an only child. I wouldn’t know) and stood up for each other when we needed to. He was the closest thing I had to an older brother. As I exited the elevator of my office, Ethan and I looked around for him. I felt this anxiety building in my body, rising like flood waters. What if it’s not the same? What if he hates me? What if I’m so different now that he can’t stand me? And I thought and I worried and I searched until I finally heard my name called. And I turned and there he was and I felt my chest pinch and a gasp leave my mouth. And I ran to him and hugged him and I felt all that anxiety melt away because he was  and I fucking missed him. As we made the walk to my apartment, we talked about everything and anything we could, what we all missed in this past year: college, dating, travel, work, friends, parents, pets, the like. About 50% of our graduating program cohort ended up going to the same college, including Kenneth. So inevitably we talked about high school people and what they were all up to, a topic we always seemed to end up on. It always felt complicated talking to Kenneth after everything happened because he continued being friends with the people that left me in high school. There was some part of me that felt…not necessarily betrayed, but hurt, that he continued to keep these people around him despite knowing what happened. It took all the way until now, nearly four years later, for me to forgive him for it. It was the first time I was able to talk about it with him where I didn’t feel angry or upset. I simply just talked about it. He told me about their friend group and what they’re up to. And I listened and nodded and was honestly just happy to be talking to him again. Then, we made our way to Fort Mason to meet up with some of my intern friends. It was definitely a strange group of people. I met up with four other interns, who each brought their   friend from college. It was like one big mishmash of people each from a different plotlines in a story. As we headed home and the night grew more somber, Kenneth mentioned to me that I seemed to be doing well. That I had really grown up. “I feel like in high school you really used to be the baby of everything,” he had said, “and now you’re like the mom of the friend group. I’m really happy for you.” I sat back and kind of reflected on everything Kenneth was seeing. Sure, we had met up a year and some odd months ago and chatted, but we didn’t really  . It was kind of just a brief meet up. His real last memory of me was still senior year, an image of me horribly depressed and crying about my lost friends. Now, he was here, sitting in my apartment, watching me bake banana bread and excitedly talk about my MIT friend group and my boyfriend, and my preparation for the incoming job cycle for full time positions, and all this other stuff. And it truly hit me how much I’ve grown and done in these three years in college. Kenneth then said goodbye and left, and I had to prepare for a different kind of reunion. I used to mention Aiden a lot in the blogs. He was, in fact, my best friend at MIT. But due to some complications and side things, Aiden was doing his own thing for a good chunk of the school year and we barely talked. As Saturday came, I braced myself again. I was going to be seeing him for the first time in maybe 8 months. I didn’t quite know what to feel. At first, I was definitely angry at Aiden for disappearing. I had opened up to him about what happened in high school, how being abandoned my friends was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life, and he had gone and done the same thing. But this anger quickly dissipated and I felt…at peace with it. Sad, sure, but quietly accepting. There was some part of me that knew that Aiden had his reasons. And sometimes friends aren’t friends forever. Or friends take different paths and end up back on the same one eventually. Or sometimes they’re just going through something. I ended up  writing a blogpost And when I saw Aiden on that hike trail at the land’s end of San Francisco, I hugged him as tight as I could and just said “I missed you” and he said “I missed you too” and apologies began to spill from his mouth to which I said “it’s okay, it’s okay” because it was okay. Of course it’s okay. I’m just happy to have my best friend back. The next two and a half hours were spent hiking and filling him on everything he had missed: who’s dating who, plans for the future, funny anecdotes from junior year, the drama he missed. We picked up right where we left off. It felt symbolic in a way, the drastic difference between my previous ended friendship and this one, how this one was able to be rekindled so strongly with some quick “I’m sorry”s and explanations. I’ve finally been able to heal and roll with these changes in my relationships. Last summer, I remember talking to Eva, filling her in on my experience. “I hate them so much,” I had said. “I constantly wish bad things to happen to them. And I know that’s bad, but there’s something inside of me that just hates them so much and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forgive them.” As I said that, my friends looked at me with such sadness, seeing how all these years later this still affected me so deeply. That night, as I sat there thinking about my conversations with Kenneth and Aiden, I realized I had finally done it. I’ve reached a point where I can forgive them. When I think of them, I don’t get nauseous, or angry, or anxious, or upset. I feel the same peace I felt when Aiden was gone. Sad, but accepting, wishing them nothing but the best. Later on in the night, Ethan and I started reminiscing again, filling Aiden in on Ethan and I’s high school cohort and friends. “That’s the thing,” Ethan says, “people  end up asking me about you, since I guess I’m one of the few people that actually is in contact with you after school. But they always ask, ‘Oh how’s Cami doing?’ and I always say ‘she’s doing really really great. Great school, great job, great friends, great relationship. Everything’s great.'” And I felt my heart swell with so much pride and a big stupid grin broke out across my face. “Ethan, you are absolutely right. I   doing great.”

This summer, I’m doing MISTI-Germany and living in Berlin. I’ve been enjoying it a lot for a number of reasons: not least because in Europe, everything is close, which allows for easy travel to different cities and countries. I’ve had friends visit me from different MISTI cities and countries, and I have a bunch of weekend trips planned for myself. Two weeks ago, I flew to Greece for a couple of days to spend time with my parents (who were there for my dad’s work) and chill on the beaches of Chalkidiki. I had a great time, the scenery was gorgeous, the food was delicious, and I did a lot of reading and relaxing. That in itself isn’t a particularly interesting story, though the photos are really pretty. Previous Next Things got interesting on my way back to Berlin. I had booked a flight for Thursday night, since the research group I’m working at for MISTI has a
 
weekly meeting ⁠ 01 and since I had spent the past several days working remotely, I didn't want to miss the big meeting Of course, nothing is that simple. If things had gone according to plan, I wouldn’t be writing this post. When I first got to the airport and had gone through
 
security, ⁠ 02 they took away my jar of kumquat jam, it was really sad By the time I left the duty free shop, I had about an hour left until departure. We were supposed to start boarding soon, but the display board still read “delayed” with no further information. Finding it strange, I sat down to wait at the gate so that I wouldn’t miss any announcements. The boarding call time came and passed with nothing happening, then the departure time itself. The board still read “delayed.” I was getting concerned. I tried talking to the airline representatives at the gate next door but no one had any information. It then occurred to me that perhaps the plane wasn’t here yet, or maybe it hadn’t left its previous destination. So I checked the arrivals board and, sure enough, the plane hadn’t landed yet. Weirdly enough, it also just said “delayed,” with no estimated arrival time. I was beginning to be very concerned. Next, I checked the Berlin airport timetable, since that is where the incoming flight originated. There, of course, I found that it had not yet departed from Berlin. So, not only was my plane not at my gate yet, it hadn’t even departed its previous airport! At least the Berlin airport website had an estimate on when it would leave. I quickly did the math and figured that without any more additional delays I would only be home in Berlin three or four hours later than originally planned – not ideal, but not terrible, either. Definitely less of a hassle than figuring out a different flight or something along those lines. So I sat and waited. Once I saw that the plane had departed Berlin (a little later than promised, of course), I relaxed, and went to get a coffee from the cafe near my gate. This gave me an excuse to sit at one of the cafe tables and
 
do some writing. ⁠ 03 I was actually working on my previous blog lol this is a pic from when I arrived in Greece, but the Thessaloniki airport is really cool in that it’s right on the water In the end, I boarded my flight without issue, and we departed with a total delay of just over three hours. I wish the story ended here, but, no, it gets even better. About half an hour before we were supposed to land the intercom system comes on for the pilot to make an announcement. Apparently, Berlin has an air curfew in place, where no plane is allowed to land in the city between the hours of midnight and 5 AM. Of course, this was originally an evening flight, and the three-hour delay would put our arrival at well past midnight. So, instead, they would land us in Hannover, a city roughly three hours west of Berlin by train. Now, I pride myself on being a pretty calm person and taking these kinds of external inconveniences in stride. In retrospect, I am a little furious at the airline for not announcing the rerouting until we were in flight. There’s no way they didn’t know about the curfew! They could have at least told us about it, and I would’ve been able to plan ahead. At the time, though, I figured there’s nothing I could do, and spent the remaining flight time racking my brain for ways to make the best of the situation. By the time we landed, I had a plan: I would talk to the airline representatives, try to get them to pay for a hotel overnight, and then spend the following morning exploring Hannover. My MISTI supervisor had messaged me that my morning meeting was cancelled, and I could move my afternoon meeting, so coming into the office wasn’t urgent. My plan fell apart as soon as we landed. For one, my airline didn’t normally fly to Hannover, so they didn’t have a service desk and there was no one to talk to. The cabin crew had given us no advice or instructions on how to proceed next, just waved us off the plane and into the
 
quiet ⁠ 04 I use the word 'quiet' here quite liberally, since we were already the third rerouted flight to land that night So, getting back to Berlin as soon as possible seemed to me the best option. A connecting flight was, of course, out of the question, so my options remained a bus or a train. Checking the available trips, I saw that all the bus tickets to Berlin had been booked until after 7 AM. Makes sense, since we were the third flight to find ourselves in this predicament. Still, I didn’t want to pay for a hotel out of pocket, and I didn’t want to spend the night at the airport or bus station. Looking at trains, I saw that there was one leaving at 2:40 AM, then the next one at 5:30 AM. Neither of those were ideal, since the clock was quickly ticking, and at 2:20 I was still at the airport with no obvious way to get to the railway station in the city center. The local trains to city center weren’t running due to the weather; there were also busses, but a) they only came every hour and b) I couldn’t find where they left from. I wasn’t feeling too hopeful that I would be leaving the city, or even the airport, before morning. I went to talk to the airport general information desk, and the guy at the counter recommended I find a group of people to split a cab to Berlin with. I didn’t particularly like this idea, because it seemed expensive and because I don’t really like talking to strangers. Still, I was out of options, so I went to the taxi area, not really knowing what I was looking for. Luckily, there was no deficit of confused people looking for a cab. I found a guy who was in the same situation as me and started talking to him. Turns out, we were both going to Berlin, and for both of us taking a cab all the way there was out of the question. We decided to just get a cab to the Hannover train station and go from there. After some confusion with some other passengers, we found a cab that would take us for only thirty euros. At that point, it was around 2:50 AM, so I assumed we were aiming for the 5:30 train. My

Except, as soon as we got there, we found that the rush was unnecessary – the train was delayed by another half hour. This wasn’t ideal, but at least it gave me time to buy a sandwich. I found a spot to sit on the railing on the platform in the chilly night air, and got to waiting. At this point, my phone was at around ten percent, so I switched it off and kept reading
 
my book. ⁠ 08 Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut, I recommend! Previous Next Slowly, the hours ticked by. I was cold, but I didn’t want to leave the platform for fear of missing the train. I was making good progress through my book. The sky was becoming light again, and sunrise was just a handful of minutes away. Finally, at close to 5 AM, the train pulled into the station. I pushed my way towards the front of the crowd, and somehow managed to grab a seat by the window. It was fully morning by then, and any sleepiness had left my body, leaving behind only exhaustion. I’ll be honest, I enjoy that second wind of wakefulness that comes on when the sun rises after a sleepless night. Everything seems to beautiful, and calm, and perfect in the morning light. I settled in to watch the scenery and kept reading my book. Thankfully, the rest of the trip passed uneventfully. I finished my book, charged my phone, and resolved to cancel my meeting and just spend the day sleeping in. At around 8:30 AM, we pulled into Berlin central station. I shuffled my way through the crowd of commuters, bought some tea and

When Taylor Swift’s  album dropped, I read a review describing “Welcome to New York” as the musical version of a peppermint latte. It was Taylor’s first decisively pop album and I was young enough to be easily seduced by the synthesized flourishes, sparkling trills. It has been many years since I’ve read that review yet I still remember that description. As a kid, I thought peppermints were spicy until I found another word to name the feeling of cool tenderness on my tongue, my entire mouth aware of itself. Maybe New York was like that too, full of feelings I couldn’t yet describe when I first visited at age thirteen on a family vacation. “Welcome to New York” wasn’t my favorite song on  , but maybe it was the one I could relate to the most. In ninth grade, my dream school was Columbia University (sorry, MIT) because it was in the Big Apple. I had some romantic notion that my life would kickstart if I lived in a city where important things happened to people, where everybody walked fast. At age fifteen, I won a national writing contest. The awards ceremony was held at Carnegie Hall. In a truly foolish moment, I only packed cork wedge heels, so the entire weekend, I traipsed around two inches taller and 50% more unbalanced than usual. Still, I was ecstatic. My medal was heavy and luminous around my neck, its weight a promise of everything that was yet to come.  , I thought. I didn’t end up applying to Columbia, as I was admitted to MIT early action, and by my senior year of high school I understood that there were more important aspects to an educational institute than which city it happened to be in. Still, during my first year in undergrad, when I was awarded a scholarship to attend a business conference held in Manhattan, I immediately accepted. With four other girls, I squeezed into a hotel room meant for two. I entered the Broadway lottery and won a ticket to one of the less popular musicals. I was willing to fling my entire self into this dream. I was so young and so ready to become the kind of person who lived in New York City. But time urged forward, and there were other cities: Sydney, Paris, Reykjavík, Auckland, Jerusalem. When I was nineteen, I had a boss who was twenty-seven and a newly minted multi-millionaire after his company had been acquired. “My main hobby is making money, but now I’ve already done that,” he told me. “So now what am I supposed to do? Travel? But every place is the same.” At the time, I didn’t understand what he meant, and even now, I don’t really get it. Every place is different, didn’t he know that? Maybe what we observe about these differences say more about us than about the places themselves. I visited New York City twice in the last month and discovered I disliked it. I hated the crowds, the scaffolding, the constant noise. Most of all, I hated the anonymity, how it felt impossible to actually become someone to anyone else. Maybe it was the two years immersed in the pandemic, maybe it was simply a shift in priorities, but I found myself yearning for the familiar: expanses of grass, wide sidewalks, people I recognized. The relative quietness of Cambridge. I don’t know what this means about who I am now. Perhaps what I’m truly afraid of is that I’m no longer full of the bright hunger that has propelled me for so long, the naive ambition that led me to insist to countless admissions officers that I wanted to  . What if I was ambitious once, but I had missed my opportunity to wire all that electricity into something magnificent, and now I’m too tired to give all of myself to anything? In New York, I visited two recent grads. Their apartment was beautiful and expensive. It overlooked the Hudson River, and at night, the city lights skimmed the water like stars caught in a dark veil. We talked about their jobs, which were high-paying and prestigious and secure even in the upcoming recession. Eventually, when the moon gleamed high and full above the horizon, I mentioned that I should go back to my friend’s place to do some work, although I wasn’t sure if I would be able to since he didn’t have Wi-Fi at his apartment. One of the guys frowned. “What? Why doesn’t he have internet?” I explained that my friend didn’t like to spend money on things he deemed unnecessary. When they asked what he did, I said he’d dropped out of MIT to work at a start-up, which had since become a tech unicorn. Their eyes held a flicker of admiration, or perhaps envy, even though they were in the gorgeous high-rise apartment and my friend was in a basement studio without air conditioning or Wi-Fi. But I understood. On the streets of New York, I felt like a pebble in a never-ending stream of people. It would be so easy to let myself be carried forward, into this city I had loved. But maybe it hadn’t been New York that I had dreamed about, after all. Maybe what I had truly wanted was to become myself, and I ended up doing that anyway.

During the storms of May, the Charles rages toward the ocean while lightning snaps Boston in two. Most people had already run for their Back Bay brownstones to tea and scented candlelight. Yet some are always late. They sprint across the dark streets in soaked socks, rain tickling their tongues as they laugh at the sheer amount of water pouring from the sky. I’d observe them from
 
23 ⁠ 01 room on the second floor of tEp, the cool independent living group located in Back Bay Boston where Isabella currently resides Through moments like these, I’ve come to realize the back alley is my favorite side of the house. Well, there’s only two to choose from, and the front isn’t too shabby either. Outside
 
32, ⁠ 02 room on the third floor of tEp This side is beautiful, but it already knows that. Perhaps, then, I just favor the underdog. Yet, I still replay stories from the back side over and over again in a routine that might resemble love. Nearly every day, I bike to and from campus down the alley. No bustling traffic, just the crackle of my wheels on asphalt. And when I go in the afternoon after a night of grinding on psets, the sun casts a glow around everything that is usually in shadow; I once saw an old man holding a bouquet of yellow flowers as he ambled past me, sporting a halo of sunlight and a smile. These daily, quiet moments from Boston and the bustling halls of the ‘tvte are some I cherish the most. Most of my memories of the alley are made as an outside observer, however. From 23, I can see rats scurrying from dumpster to dumpster. There’s a different sort of ecosystem out there, one that runs on clandestine trash robberies and raccoons’ conspiracies. This nightlife reminds me of my childhood make-believe stories, where Redwall-esque rodents fought wars with sewing needles under the full moon. A more imaginative time in my life perhaps, one I associate with carefree hours devoted just to think. Now, I ponder how the lives of these rats, moths, and even the flight of the feather under the streetlamp are more complex than we can fathom. It fills me with curiosity, knowing there is so much to be explored. Can we truly model that moth flitting in the light or the dust settling on that old mattress down to the molecule? My favorite view of the back is from the roof because it’s no longer just the alley anymore. You can see the sprawling strip of Boston between  tEp I’m not built for this. I’m not built for inventions, or science, or anything that’s hard. I just want to close my eyes.  art by isabella!! ugh the lighting and composition are just exquisite

I live on a fairly musical wing of Next House, and every semester, we put up an extensive list of performances involving people from the wing on the whiteboard. We had a   of events listed this semester—
 
Next Act, ⁠ 01 more about Next Act coming (hopefully) soon :0 One day, amidst all these items, there appeared an item that said something like “Mamma Mia: Jonathan, May 7th @ Big Cold River.” It turns out that one of the
 
social members ⁠ 02 a 'social member' is someone who hangs out in a living community, but does not live there. THIS MAN FLEW TO JAPAN TO SING ABBA IN A BIG COLD RIVER 
or so it goes, ⁠ 03 to be honest the story seems a little too convenient for me, but who cares. upon digging a little further the only thing I learned was that this man was also a Harvard undergraduate, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it. This project, of course, was a fantastic idea that had to be encouraged. And, what better way to encourage this idea by watching  (2008), the jukebox musical-turned-movie featuring Meryl Streep? The wing group chat conversation went something like this: [5:37 PM] Nicole H. ’22: Are people down. To watch mamma Mia tn in main lounge. [5:46 PM] Nicole H. ’22: 10 pm; ill make popcorn? [5:54 PM] Derek Y. ’22: honestly sure probably maybe [6:24 PM] Me: YES I had seen  before, and I remember not being particularly impressed by it the first time. I think I had watched it during a phase in my life where I truly believed that all art had to be serious, and I just found it uninteresting. This time, however, I was fully blown away by how aggressively the movie leaned into
 
its own sense of the absurd. ⁠ 04 funnily enough, one could theoretically argue that the absurdity of <em>Mamma Mia!</em> ultimately traces its roots to the fundamental absurdity of opera. i will not be taking further questions at this time. emerging from the ocean with flippers on their feet and then riding away into the sunset on jet skis So, we did just that. We sat on the couch, sang along to the songs we knew, and we chatted and pointed out all the weird little bits about the film, such as when the movie  suddenly cross-fades to a fantasy world where Meryl Streep is on a boat truly excellent performance of “Does Your Mother Know?” attempts to sing 
some new inside jokes ⁠ 05 nodders! If you’ve made it this far into the blog post and you haven’t seen  , you’re probably wondering: what is this film about? What could possibly make this film so amazing? Well, I can give you a basic pitch.   is a jukebox musical, meaning that it was constructed from pre-existing songs—in this case, ABBA songs. The basic plot is that Sophie, the child of a single mother and hotel owner, Donna, is about to get married. Sophie has never known who her father is, but, by reading her mother’s diary, she finds out that there are three potential candidates—Harry, Sam, and Bill. Without informing her fiancé or her mother, she invites all three men to the island based on the premise that “I will know my father when I see him.” Comedy and calamity ensue. I would provide you more context, but, unfortunately, beyond this flimsy conceit,   as a film does not make any sense. There is a scene where the bachelor party crashes the bachelorette party by  swinging in from ropes that are seemingly anchored in the sky “Our Last Summer” It is a fantastic film on every level. Following the first showing, the wing had caught a bit of a  fever—or, at least, some of us did. The film gained some stalwart defenders in me and Nicole H. ’22, and the lyric refrains of the song, “Mamma Mia,” could be heard throughout the hallways of 4W. Just as in the film, shenanigans ensued. In perhaps the most unhinged moments of my undergraduate career thus far, Nicole and I started a tradition of turning off all the lights in the bathroom and singing along to “Mamma Mia” while brushing our teeth in the dark. That may just seem weird to you as an outside observer, but the comedic value of someone walking into the bathroom while this was occurring was immense. Besides, it was absurd. So was the film. One of our wing members—Jeffery Y. ’22—had missed the first showing of   In one conversation, he made the mistake of expressing some mild regret about not having seen the movie. To correct this unfortunate circumstance, just two weeks later: [8:17 PM] Me: we are watching mamma mia again [8:17 PM] Me: if folks would like to see this insanity We hadn’t even closed the tab with the movie from our first viewing, so we just rewound to the start of the movie and watched it again from the start. On my second watch through, I started paying more attention to the cinematography, which I managed to find similarly absurd. There’s, of course, the  camera movement After the second viewing, we also watched the CinemaSins and evaluated whether or not each sin was justified. We concluded that most of them were, in fact, not. They had missed the point! The film was intended to be absurd. Surely, absurdity was not a crime. As a fully converted acolyte of the church of  , I ended up talking about how great the movie was at a blogger check-in. “It’s just a truly incredible piece of work.” Some people seemed to be amused by how excited I was. Others were mostly just bemused. Fortunately, one of the people at this blogger check-in was  Paolo  with a bunch of newly admitted students. Unfortunately, neither of us had any clue what we were actually going to watch, but, here, suddenly, was our answer. We would have to watch  . We needed to be thoroughly prepared before our event, so the only correct thing to do was, of course, to watch the movie again. We watched it in the Next House
 
TFL, ⁠ 06 the George Hosker Memorial Tastefully Furnished Lounge, or, 'that big lounge on the first floor of Next House' an extremely ugly fish Upon completing the film, Paolo and I very animatedly walked Meghana through all of the critical scenes and sequences which she had missed, leaning into the fantastic nature of the film. This was a lot of fun; the semester thus far had been rough for me, and getting to spend some time enjoying a purely absurd activity with friends was really nice. Perhaps more importantly, however, the viewing was also an excuse for Paolo, Meghana, and I to catch up with each other. We chatted for a long time after the film was over, talking about the semester, about future plans, and everything else in between. Of course, by the time Paolo and I actually ran our pre-CPW event, I knew almost every beat of the movie. We logged onto a Zoom call and streamed it, and got to hang out with a bunch of cool prefrosh, some of whom were already very into  , some of whom were not but were excited to watch anyways, and some of whom were, understandably, confused about why Paolo and I had so much enthusiasm for this random 2008 jukebox musical. During the call, we paused the movie at the break between
 
the first and second day. ⁠ 07 the movie is adapted from the stage musical, which occurs in two acts. unfortunately, movies don't have intermissions, so they sort of just cut from the first day to the second day. Later, during CPW, I was at a Rainbow Lounge event hanging out with some queer prefrosh  for the sake of hanging out with more queer people  watch party. I very excitedly replied that was. In that moment,   graduated from being
 
a mere in-joke within my existing communities ⁠ 08 though, to be honest, i am not convinced brushing your teeth together in the dark to "Mamma Mia" can be described as a <em>mere</em> in-joke I took a little break from   after showing number four. The first four viewings of the film had all occurred in a one-month period, and I was finally out of excuses to watch it again. Besides, the end of the semester was fast approaching, and things were ramping up. There was no time. Eventually, however, the semester began drawing to a close, which also meant that acapella concerts were finally happening. This fact would be completely irrelevant, if it were not for the fact that my acapella group, the Asymptones,  was doing an ABBA medley . 
For complicated reasons, ⁠ 09 okay, they're not that complicated, but the details are boring, so they have been relegated to this footnote. we had an end-of-semester logistical meeting in Building 2, and our social was being held in Simmons Hall, and these buildings are across campus from each other. By the fifth watching of  , I was running out of new things to notice. I just sat and let the absurdity wash over me. We ate pizza and drank lemonade and enjoyed each other’s company as the movie ran on. After the movie, we cleaned up and sang  our alumni song My last watching of   at MIT this semester occurred during senior week, when  only a few people remained on campus Our wing of Next House was granted permission to write on the walls and doors this semester, since they are being repainted over the summer. After the final viewing, Nicole chose to write up the lyrics to “Mamma Mia.” Previous Next I’ve been missing 4W and the Asymptones and all of our shenanigans this summer, and a local theatre company happened to be putting on a performance of the stage musical version of  . I felt almost obligated to go—I mean, at this point, I had spent over 10 hours with the movie. I bought tickets and showed up, not knowing exactly what to expect. The movie and the stage musical are different in many ways, with subtle changes to the order of events and songs based on
 
the constraints of each medium. ⁠ 10 to vastly oversimplify, in the stage musical, set changes are harder, and so often events occur in places where it seems a little awkward. in the movie, the length constraint is more strict, and so motivating events are sometimes cut. After the end of both the movie and the stage musical, the actors perform “Dancing Queen” and “Waterloo” during the credits and bows respectively. When our performance of  ended, the whole crowd was singing along to “Waterloo.” It felt like a communal celebration of the performance—which, even if didn’t make sense, was a lot of fun. The answer is that it doesn’t matter. In fact, the fact that it doesn’t matter  . The film is absurd. The musical is absurd. Neither of them make much sense whatsoever. Yet, in spite of all this, they are fun. That is, perhaps, the important thing. Sometimes, when something is fun, even if it is absurd or pointless, you have to lean into it. Whether you’re watching the movie or the stage musical, the best part of   is that it feels like every single person involved with the performance is having fun. You can almost hear the laughter in the writer’s room every time a joke lands on stage, and you can see how much fun the actors are having throughout the movie,  up to the bitter end dancing on the boardwalk and jumping into the water while the man from ABBA plays piano on a boat It turns out that this is also the best part of being at MIT—not that “every single person…is having fun,” but rather that the people at MIT, if you find the right friend groups, will let you lean into whatever absurd obsession you happen to find yourself stuck in the midst of. You can find people to make music with in acapella groups; you can find people to watch and rewatch movies with in your living group; you can find people who will  pay you to write a two-thousand-plus word blog post about whatever you want That, it seems to me, is a form of love. It is leaning into the absurd, and having other people lean into the absurd with you. Sometimes, at MIT, “the absurd” is getting really deeply into  puzzles Interconnected Embedded Systems  seven times and knowing all the songs by heart. Both are good in their own unique ways, but they are also both good in the sense that sharing that joy with others will always be good,
 
no matter how insignificant that source of joy ultimately is ⁠ 11 cf. <em><a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/">Everything Everywhere All At Once</a> </em>(2022) Oh, and that “Big Cold River” performance? We didn’t quite get around to it this semester, but Jonathan did end up singing “Mamma Mia” on the Harvard Bridge in the middle of a torrential downpour on the way back from a boba run, so we’ll call it a mixed success. Maybe next semester.

Wait. Why am I here? For those of you who don’t know, I actually don’t work at MIT anymore. I actually haven’t worked at MIT for a whole week. So, again, why am I here? Well, there’s really only two reasons. The first is I’m three days away from my first day at my
 
new job ⁠ 01 someone decided i should be a director. what?! The second reason is actually buried in the first reason. I’m less than three days away from my starting my new job, and I’m kind of nervous. Well,   is KIND OF an understatement here, I might be a tad…scared? It’s literally everything I’ve been building to since I was 19-years-old and decided I wanted to work in communications. The problem is, I’m starting to think that getting to this point might have been the easy part and what comes next is when the work really starts. Seriously, for better or worse, I’ve spent basically every waking moment of my life since I was probably 12-years-old being
 
anti-authority and anti-conformity, ⁠ 02 Think of a mix of Audrey’s angsty vibes mixed with Cami’s willingness to call anyone out  the authority. I know I’ve written a lot about leading a secret team of talent individuals, but this seems different. I approached all those projects with the idea that we can do it better than everyone else. I approached everything we worked on same way I’ve approached anything I’ve ever done, with a hint of delusional confidence, audacity, and a healthy chip on my shoulder. Does that approach still work the further you go? Or, do I have to change who I am and how I do things in order to keep advancing? I mean it got me here, but is it good enough? Am I good enough? I don’t know the answer to that question, but I do know what I’m going to do. Like I said earlier, I’ve worked for this since I was 19. Every up and down, every choice, every loss, every lesson, and every victory has theoretically led me to this moment. Which means, all I can do is trust myself and do what I can to the best of my abilities. That doesn’t mean I won’t change a bit. Ideally, people continue to grow and with growth comes different perspectives and new approaches, BUT there’s a reason I’ve made it as far as I have. There’s something that I bring that people saw value in. So I owe it to them, I owe it to the people who have helped me get to this point, and to myself continue to trust myself and be myself. And whatever happens after that, happens. Good luck, everyone. See ya!! #i can't be gotten rid of that easy

Alan: Oh boy,
 here we go again ⁠ 01 CJ: I find this appropriate given you watched Mamma Mia five times this summer. (Alan: For the record, it’s been <em>seven</em> times in this <em>calendar year</em>, and, also, spoilers for a future blog post.) CJ: Why does it have to be “oh boy”? “Oh girl”? “Oh child”? “Oh sweet mercies”? Alan: It’s too early in the post to get derailed, CJ. The people have come here for fortune cookie content, not pedantic deliberation on the origins of particular phrases in the English language. CJ: Business, then. It was a dark and stormy night… Alan: It was a dark night. I don’t think it was particularly stormy. I was visiting Shuli in East Campus one night, and, afterwards, thought I might as well stop at CJ’s room while I was at it. CJ: It was a Friday night after a party, I think, so I was exhausted. Alan and I were sitting on  my excellent couch Alan: What does “shooting the breeze” mean anyway? CJ: I’m pretty sure you asked that just to give me an opportunity to snap back at you, but I’m above that. I’m above petty games, Alan. I’m so above petty games, in fact, that in that evening, my thoughts were filled with pious and noble ambitions, which I so eloquently conveyed in our insightful conversation. Alan: Ah yes, our conversation. How did we get there? CJ: We were talking about emails. You know how MIT has  big email culture Alan: The classic MIT flame war looks like this. Some poor, unsuspecting frosh accidentally sends an email to every undergraduate dorm mailing list without bcc’ing, meaning that anyone can reply-all to the email. Since these mailing lists have thousands of people on them, someone inevitably does, and it all sort of cascades from there. CJ: Someone replies, giving advice about how to unsubscribe from the thread. The advice was to reply with the message “unsubscribe”. Alan: This, of course, does not work, and only results in an additional flood of people sending the word “unsubscribe” to thousands of people, sometimes to the point where MIT’s email servers start slowing down. CJ: Do they reply “unsubscribe” because they think it’ll unsubscribe them, or because they want to keep feeding the flame? We may never know. Alan:
 
Regardless, ⁠ 02 CJ: It's irregardless, Alan. CJ: What can’t you unsubscribe from? Mail. Not email. Actual, physical mail. And you know what’d be really funny? Us, sending everyone mail, all saying nothing but “unsubscribe”. Alan: We started by considering mailing real envelopes to people with stamps and everything, but that seemed like a lot of work. I mean, writing out addresses would be a pain and envelopes and stamps cost money, so it all seemed like too much hassle to actually manage. CJ: But what if we didn’t have to address them? After all, the mailboxes in dorms are managed by undergrads. I lived in East Campus, and Alan lived in Next, and we both knew desk workers who could get us access to the mailboxes. Alan: This was progress. We ran into another roadblock, though, which is that CJ and I are incredibly lazy, and cutting out pieces of paper which just said “unsubscribe” and putting them into envelopes seemed annoying. CJ: But what if we didn’t use envelopes? What if we just cut small slips of paper that said unsubscribe and put them in the mailboxes? Alan: That seemed too low-brow. See, the incredibly difficult thing about being both lazy and a perfectionist is that one is never satisfied. CJ: MIT students, huh. Alan: Eventually—and perhaps because of related shenanigans occurring in my wing of Next House at the time—we thought: “what if we bought custom fortune cookies which just said the word ‘unsubscribe’ in them?” CJ: My first thought was: no way. That would be too expensive, right? Alan: My first thought was: this is stupid. My second thought was: let’s do it. CJ: One quick search later, we found a website selling custom fortune cookies for about $0.70 per cookie, and cheaper if ordered in bulk. Alan: We wanted to deliver the fortune cookies to Next and EC, which meant ordering around 700 cookies. CJ: The pricing was such that it cost around the same to buy 700 and 1000: around $500. Alan: This is bad pricing design, but we saw the opportunity, and we were absolutely going to exploit it. CJ: But where could we get $500? As much as I wanted to see this happen, I wasn’t willing to use my own money. Alan: This is where the third participant in our story comes in. The De Florez Fund for Humor. Alan: The De Florez Fund is a grant run by MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, which gives grants to various student organizations when they want to do something funny, or, as they put it, “make MIT smile.” CJ: We promise we
 
didn’t get paid ⁠ 03 CJ: Not by the De Florez Fund, at least. MIT Admissions pays us to write blog posts. (Alan: <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/be-a-blogger-2022/">This could be you!</a>) Alan: I’ve been in a few clubs which have gotten De Florez grants before, and they’ve always been very nice, so I wondered if we could apply for a De Florez fund grant for this project. CJ: There’s a saying I’ve heard, along the lines of, if you want to do   in MIT, you can get funding for it. Alan: So we decided to go for it. And by “decided to go for it,” I mean that, on that Tuesday, we put a grant proposal together in the span of about two hours at a random table in the third-floor atrium of Building 34. CJ: You make it sound like the proposal was hastily written. I thought it was rather eloquent. Quote: “this project hopes to provide to students who are tired of reading their email inboxes, a pleasant surprise upon opening their mailboxes, especially during a stressful time of the semester.” Alan: We also called the fortune cookie place to ask how long it would take to make all the cookies, since we didn’t want them to arrive after everybody had left campus already. They assured us the cookies would arrive in no time. CJ: I also asked if they would reproduce the message faithfully on the fortune cookies, punctuation and capitalization and all. It was important to us that it said “unsubscribe”, all lowercase, no period at the end. The nice person on the other end of the phone said yes, and we were satisfied. Alan: Honestly, we were more than satisfied. I feel like this is the exactly the kind of request that a company that makes custom fortune cookies might be exasperated by, and the person on the other end of the line was   nice to us and our particular demands. CJ: We submitted the grant proposal at 12:48 PM. Alan: I went to Maseeh for lunch, and then went home. Then, at 2:58 PM, just two short hours later, CJ sent me a message that just said “APPROVED”. CJ: I was ecstatic. I had a feeling it was gonna be approved, but seeing that email gave me so much joy. I placed the fortune cookie order immediately. Alan: We filed the reimbursement request with MIT’s systems just twenty minutes after the approval email came in. This was an incredible turnaround. CJ: Two days later, we got confirmation that it’d arrive the next Tuesday. Alan and I made plans to receive the fortune cookies and place them in mailboxes that night. Alan: Just to clear, the time between having the idea and a thousand fortune cookies arriving at Next House was just a week and a half.   The UPS Ground shipping information said that the package was twenty pounds. CJ: That execution, man, that was fast.
 
Er, woman. Person? ⁠ 04 Alan: please just imagine me gently shaking my head. Alan: Unfortunately, this is where we have to introduce a fourth participant in the story. COVID-19. CJ: Alan got COVID. Alan: More specifically, my roommate tested positive for COVID just twelve hours after we had spent a significant amount of time
 
sightsinging barbershop quartets together. ⁠ 05 honestly, probably the quintessentially 'me' way to get COVID. CJ: I took the shuttle to Next and greeted our story’s fifth participant: Jason C. ’22. Alan: Our lord and savior. CJ: Jason was working desk that night, so Alan and I told him about our plan. He agreed to help, of course. Alan: I sat quietly in my room, wondering how it was going. Alas. CJ: Jason and I opened the box. And wow, what a sight. We sent Alan some pictures. Previous Next CJ: We filtered through the thousand fortune cookies, discarding the ones that were broken. I didn’t feel too bad about “discarding” them, though, because Jason was saving them all to eat for himself later. Alan: Apparently, these fortune cookies also happened to taste particularly good. CJ: Have you not tasted the fortune cookies? Alan: Of course I have. The first thing I did when I got out of isolation was go to my mailbox and collect my “unsubscribe” cookie. CJ: Well, you certainly aren’t the only diligent Next resident to check their mailbox. Alan: While CJ and Jason were still presumably hard at work behind desk— CJ: —and it was hard work, because
 
we were short ⁠ 06 I am 158 cm and Jason is about as tall as me. (Alan: if only I were there.) Alan:
 
—Nicole H. ‘22 ⁠ 07 who features heavily in an upcoming blog post. CJ: The reason Nicole found out in the first place, I think, was because Jeffery Y. ’22 found out and sent it to some group chat. And my confession, Alan, is that I told Jeffery to come check his mailbox that night. Alan: You did not! CJ: I did. I’m sorry. It would’ve happened anyway, because you know how scrupulous Nexties are about their inboxes. Alan: Ah yes, MIT students and young people in general are obviously notoriously good at checking their mail. CJ: They’re not, by the way. Jason told me that half the fortune cookies were still there on his next shift. Alan: Honestly, there were probably still a couple dozen left in the mailboxes by the end of the semester. What a shame. CJ: After we infiltrated the mailboxes in Next, we packed the remaining cookies in the box, and I took the Tech Shuttle back to East Campus. Alan: Unable to help in any other way, I sent an extremely cryptic email to both next-forum and the EC mailing list, telling folks to look out for surprises in their mailboxes and to fill out a feedback form once they had done so. the complete lack of details is astounding Alan: CJ’s part of the story is, of course, much more interesting. CJ: In EC, I walk up to this innocent desk worker. For the life of me, I can’t remember who it was, but it wasn’t someone I talked to often, if at all. I place the huge box I’m carrying on the desk, and guess what I say. Alan:   What did you say, CJ? CJ: Thanks for humoring me, Alan. I said, “I have six hundred fortune cookies in this box all saying the word ‘unsubscribe’, can you let me in so I can place one in each mailbox?” They stared at me with wide eyes, waiting for me to give even a hint of explanation, but I refused. Suddenly, they burst out laughing, and open the door to let me in. After all, what else would you have said in that situation? Alan: I mean, they could’ve said no. CJ: Yeah, but the  . Alan: The call of the memes was too strong. CJ: So true, bestie. Alan: So yeah. That’s the end of the story. To summarize, we convinced MIT to give us
 
five hundred dollars ⁠ 08 CJ: Five hundred plus <em>shipping</em>. CJ: Was it worth it, Alan? Was it worth buying a thousand fortune cookies and placing them into a bunch of mailboxes? Alan: I mean, the fortune cookies tasted good, so…yes? Also, I didn’t do any of the “placing them into a bunch of mailboxes part,” so definitely worth it on my end. All I had to do was write some dumb emails. CJ: Alan, I was trying to lead into the data analysis. Alan: Oh, of course. How could I possibly forget the most important part of this project:  Here are some highlights from the Google Form: Jason C. ‘22: what does ǝqᴉɹɔsqnsun mean?

There’s this thing called a “cruft house”, when a group of MIT graduates live together after graduation. And the cruft houses I’ve seen have such interesting names, like Castle Kingside, Soviet Russia, or The Bunker. The first night the three of us moved into our new place, I   we come up with a name. The three of us-Sathwik, Rohan, and I-are all interns for the same startup this summer. We met when some intern scoped a few of us on LinkedIn and sent us a Discord invite, and then one of the intern coordinators sent the invite to everyone else. On the server, we shared pictures of all the swag we got sent months before, in January. Shirts, caps, jackets, water bottles, all branded with the company logo. This was before we knew that the internship would be in-person. We were informed in early March, ten months before we had to move in. We had the option to pick the Menlo Park or New York offices, and I chose Menlo Park. And on the Discord server us interns were in, I looked for others finding housing, and found Sathwik and Rohan. We’d been told that they’d give “assistance” in finding housing. This amounted to linking us to the websites for Airbnb and Kopa. Well, it’s not like we had any better leads, and it’s not like I wanted to put in any effort. I told the other two that I’d be okay with whatever choice they picked, as long as they were okay with it too. It turns out that none of the choices were okay. Everything was either too far or too expensive. Was it tricky because there were three of us, because we were searching for a short-term lease in short notice, or because it was the Bay Area? We settled for a one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Mountain View. The bedroom had two beds, and there was a couch, so we’d fit. It costs $5500 per month. “Beggars can’t be choosers,” Sathwik said. We took stock of the unit the night we moved in. It didn’t have air conditioning or three-prong outlets or bowls. The shower temperature was fickle, and we only had one copy of the keys, even when they said they’d give us three. “You can copy it yourselves,” said the owner. “We can reimburse if you want.” As much as I want to complain about housing in the bay area, though, this isn’t a post about that. This is a post about how I’m sharing a house with people who started as two randos, who became roommates and, eventually… coworkers. On our first night together, we talked to each other about where we’re from and what we’re studying, because we didn’t even know   about each other. Sathwik’s from UT Austin and is an incoming senior, Rohan’s from Georgia Tech and is a master’s student. We crack jokes about the tech stack and living in Silicon Valley, gossip about where we’ve worked before (or haven’t worked before, in my case), and talk about logistics like how we get to work. On days when we all go to our office in Menlo Park, which is most days of the week, we wake up at around 7 or 8 or 9, depending on what time whoever’s first meeting was. On some days we all go to our WeWork in San Francisco, and carpool with Sue, one of the interns who lives down in South Bay. But some days when we go to SF we take the Caltrain up. And sometimes we take a Lyft to get back home, but most of the time we commute. I remember the experience of going home from SF with Rohan after eating dinner with coworkers, one Thursday night. It was our first time commuting from SF, and we had to wrangle with the many transport systems. We learned that there was a difference between the BART and the Muni, and how if you ride the BART to Millbrae it   toward the end. It doesn’t make a u-turn, it starts going in reverse. Rohan and I weren’t ready for it, much in the same way I’ve experienced dealing with some transport systems for the first time. But the difference is that we were together doing it. Even if we spent most of the time on our phones or sleeping or not talking to each other, we were there together, and that made it feel different, and it made me feel less alone. Near the end of our BART trip, we get this beautiful view of the city at sunset. The sky was alight with bright, orange mushrooms, and red lights rolling on a river. The city was a hundreds of colorful pebbles on a beach of black sand, its shore fading from red, to orange, to yellow, to bright blue, to dark blue. Across us, the lights of the airport were like red stitches on gray fabric, with white cones of light cutting through. I was too timid to tell Rohan about it, but I’m sure he saw me gaping in awe at the scene. It took us two hours to commute home, because the local Caltrain took  . Shortly after we arrived, Sathwik came back too, also from SF. He left the city 75 minutes after we did, and arrived at the same time, because he took a Lyft with Sue. Ah well. The day before our first Monday, which was our first day all moved in, we went for groceries at this corner shop five minutes away from us. It’s the only grocery store that’s in a reasonable distance, because that’s how suburbs are, I guess. We got pasta and milk and fruit. For dinner, we cooked some pasta. And by “we”, I mean mostly them, as I had to leave a few minutes in to go to a dance. The pasta was edible, but it wasn’t spectacular. The leftovers stayed in our fridge for a month. Evidently, we thought we’d be eating our leftovers more than we ended up doing. We don’t cook that often. For breakfast we eat cereal, or microwave oatmeal, or make toast, or eat yogurt. We all eat our lunches in the office, and sometimes we eat dinner with coworkers or have leftovers from lunch. On weekends, Rohan usually cooks something, Sathwik is out with his friends, and I get takeout. There was one time we made pancakes together, but that was it. For all that we don’t cook, though, we buy groceries together weekly. We’d stock up on breakfast foods and buy things like toiletries or chips. There’s a Safeway near our office in Menlo Park, and sometimes we walk there after work and take a Lyft to bring groceries home. One time, our Lyft driver was this person named Anh, who talked to us about their music tastes and how they’re studying aviation and what games they’re into right now. It’s mostly Sathwik who keeps the conversation afloat, with Rohan and I inserting the occasional comment. When we eat lunch at work, our conversation topics abound, and we talk about careers and frameworks and what we did on weekends. Some nights, we eat out with coworkers, and the conversation is alight, and some other nights, we eat with only the three of us. There’s this cheap burrito place about a fifteen minute walk away, that we get dinner at sometimes. We’d take a Lyft from work straight to the diner, eat dinner, then walk home together. Because that place is near the Google Quad, we often see tech workers, talking about crypto or other companies. We eat mostly in silence, scrolling on our phones. When we do talk, it’s about logistics:   The lack of conversation is a welcome change of pace, sometimes. In the evenings after work, we stay in. Sometimes we have our own dinners with friends or events, but most of the time, we’re at home. We’re off on our own little corners of the house: Sathwik on the desk in the living room, me on the couch, Rohan in the bedroom or the kitchen, or whatever permutation we feel like that night. We spend a lot of our time on calls with family or friends, but after work, we mostly get out of the way of each other’s lives. Mostly. We have one rule in the house:  . That was part of our accountability to each other. Sathwik and I used to pull Rohan out of working, those first few weeks. Whenever we’d see him doing something that looks like VS Code or Google Docs, we’d tell him to do it tomorrow. It came to the point that on one holiday, we spotted Rohan doing work in the bedroom, and Sathwik had to call me for an “intervention”. I came in, and see Rohan complaining that Sathwik hid his work laptop. “Rohan, the first step toward getting better is admitting you have a problem,” I said. “Alone, we are weak, and we must learn to embrace the guidance of a higher power.” “Is that from a twelve-step program?” Rohan asked. “Why would I know   about addiction?” I replied. “Have you considered, say, watching a movie? Reading a book? Playing a video game?” Sathwik asked. “You know my Switch is right there, we can play Smash or something.” “Yeah, don’t we have a Netflix account?” I asked. Rohan nods. Sathwik and I trade glances. “Go watch some Netflix,” Sathwik said. “I’ll give you back your work laptop tomorrow.” Rohan stands up. “Okay,  . You’re right,” Rohan said, “I’m doing too much work. I’m going for a walk.” “That works too,” I reply. Sathwik and I stayed in the bedroom, as Sathwik shows me where he’s been hiding the laptop: on his lap, under the sheets. We waited until Rohan was out of sight. Sathwik broke the silence. “I’m a bad influence.” “Why?” I asked. “Because you do work at home and claim it’s for a ‘different project’? We get it Sathwik, you’re doing research with a lab on the side.” “Not  . It’s because I work too hard at work.” “I’m not saying that’s not true.” “  I work too hard?” I paused, thinking about how to reply. “Yes.” On weekends, we do our own things. Meet up with friends, go sightseeing, go to events, watch movies. Sometimes we ride into the city together, go off alone, and come back together to take the Caltrain home. And come weekdays, we go back to work. Wake up at the same time, take a Lyft, go to meetings, eat lunch, program, eat dinner, go home, go on voice calls, go to sleep. I thought that the monotony would be a nice change of pace, but it’s not. The only reason I can withstand living here is because of Rohan and Sathwik. On that first Sunday night together, we set up a Splitwise for group buys, talk about rent, talk about what we need to buy. And I bring up that we need a name: a name for the house, which would name our group chats, and our Splitwise group, and whatever else. Rohan looked like he couldn’t care less, and Sathwik said he trusted whatever I’d come up with. “That’s it, then,” I said. “I’m deciding.” “Okay,” said Sathwik. “What’s the name, then?” “We’re going to be called  ,” I replied. Rohan giggles. Sathwik doesn’t. “That’s such an awful pun,” Sathwik said. “Do you have any better ideas?” I asked. No response from either of them. “I thought not,” I said.

I took thermodynamics last fall, where I realized that a bomb calorimeter was actually a pretty good analogy for my life, and then I decided I had a problem. In my head, work is an escape. Working is how I avoid thinking about the other things I need to do but have not done and do not want to do; working is how I run from my fear that nobody will be there to catch me if I’m anything less than conventionally successful; working gives me a reference frame to force my thoughts into some semblance of order instead of confusion-despair-and-fear, and suddenly my ignored problems have piled up like the laundry that I keep washing but not folding. To get back to the thermodynamics analogy, I’m a little particle ping-ponging inside of a box. I also want to get out of this box, because this box is sad and boring, and there’s a whole wide world of Experiences to enjoy outside of this box. I also have some options for the way I sproing around inside of this box: Work is directed motion, and sometimes directed motion is good — like when you power pistons, or push a cart, or carry a box up the stairs. Doing things with a purpose is good, and useful, and sometimes it helps me get to cool places that I didn’t really know existed before. But sometimes, the only reason I’m doing work is because I’m being squashed:  And the more squashed you get, the more work you have to do to pretend you’re not being squashed:  and then at some point I tell myself that this is Actually Good, and the work is meaningful, and in reality I should probably just:  Which is not to say that I can’t escape this box of gloom by doing a lot of work. I probably can’t, because this box is really really big and actually pretty analogous to a bomb calorimeter, where all the work I do is measurable but ultimately dissipates into the vastness of the box that I’m in. But it’s possible! Unfortunately, when you put in enough work to make a bomb calorimeter stop being a bomb calorimeter such that everything inside is now outside… This is bad for the undergrad. I started writing this blog in the fall, when I was crying on a semi-regular basis, dropping my classes, and generally wrestling with a whole lot of thoughts. That was a bad semester, and I resorted back to work-as-a-coping-mechanism for the spring. The spring,
 
in detail:  ⁠ 01 <i>not </i>a typical MIT schedule 6.036 (Intro to Machine Learning, 12 units):  One of the first classes I’ve taken that counts towards my 6-1 major! I actually really liked the content of this class. I found the homework to be more plug-and-chug than I would’ve enjoyed, and I wish that it had gone more into matrix calculus, but it was overall a good time. I really appreciated that there was open OH to talk about machine learning – I took my UROP work to open OH once to ask for advice – instead of focusing solely on homework problems and exam review and other generally scorable things. My only major complaint is that the fire alarm went off during the midterm, and all our scores got cancelled, leading to the final being a whopping 45% of our grade. Stressful. 6.129 (Biological Circuit Engineering Laboratory, CI-M + Institute Lab, 12 units):  This one’s a synthetic biology class where we designed circuits of genes and then stuck them into cells. It also counts as a CI-M for both 20 and 6, so I’m knocking out two requirements in one class. It’s ten hours of lecture/lab time a week, but there’s very little work outside of that, and they feed you snacks!! Also overall a good time even though none of us got the experimental results we wanted. My group designed the cellular version of a band pass filter, which is surprisingly similar to the electrical version of a band pass filter (i.e. a low and a high pass filter cascaded together.) Given that it’s a CI-M, we also had to write about our experimental design and results. I really enjoy talking about biology and making people tell me how wrong I am, so this was fun for me, but your mileage may vary based on how much you enjoy writing papers. 7.06 (Cell Biology, 12 units):  Possibly my favorite class by a long shot, which surprised me, because I haven’t really liked the workflow of biology classes before this. I declared a whole double major because I thought I knew I didn’t want to do biology, and post 7.06, I’ve decided I do want to do biology again. Highlights include our open-book open-internet open-anything-but-other-people exam where the question was basically, “Propose a mechanism for how this phenomenon happened,” and then linked the relevant paper describing the phenomenon  from 2021  that stated the mechanism wasn’t actually known. Sometimes I wonder if this was just crowdsourcing for the next paper. 7.571/7.572 (Quantitative Analysis of Biological Data, 6 units each):  Two half-semester grad biostatistics classes that I signed up for because I missed math and I haven’t taken anything here except 18.022. It didn’t have enough math, and I felt like I didn’t learn anything that I hadn’t already covered in
 
two years of high school statistics. ⁠ 02 AP Stats + a post-AP-stats class 8.02 (Physics II, GIR, 12 units):  I was technically on my fourth attempt at this class. I failed the ASE, thankfully on P/NR; I late-dropped it my freshman spring
 mid-psychotic-break ⁠ 03 tl;dr adhd meds went wrong; not a typical feature of freshman springs nor meds in general 20.265 (Genetics for Biological Engineering, 6 units):  I went to two lectures for this class, and then I stopped going because the idea of hauling myself to another lecture that day made me want to throw up. I ended up punting this after a friend asked me, “What is  wrong  with you,” after seeing my Canvas while I was flopped facedown on the kitchen floor making gremlin noises with my laptop next to me, which got me down to…a still-ridiculous number of units. The content was cool, though, and I’ll probably give it another go sometime in the future. 21G.702 (Spanish II, HASS-E/HASS-H, 12 units):  I took Spanish I over IAP, mostly because I felt like a huge failure after the fall and I wanted the little win of doing well in a class. Spanish, because I like languages and I felt ashamed that I’d lived in a predominantly Asian/Hispanic community for 12 years and somehow never managed to engage with people enough to learn their language despite hearing it almost every day. The Spanish I/II textbook subscription lasted 6 months, and I’m cheap, so I decided to take Spanish II in the spring to avoid having to buy it again in the future as I plan on taking more Spanish classes. I really like having a third language to communicate in: it’s cool thinking about the linguistic differences to English and Mandarin Chinese. It took as much time, if not more time, than some of my technical classes, and I’ve learned my lesson about underestimating the time that HASS classes can take. GEN228 (Clinical Genetics, Harvard cross-registered, 12 units):  I read a bunch of papers about rare genetic diseases and then walked to MGH every Friday to talk to people who researched the disease and people who were living with said disease. Every week, a different student group had to present a literature review of the week’s assigned readings, which meant that the only really rough week in this class was the week I spent about 10 hours reading papers and building a slide deck with my group prior to our presentation. Even though I’m generally introverted, I really appreciated being able to talk to people who were willing to share their experiences with their rare genetic diseases. I like hearing their stories, and I want to be able to attach the weight of their grief and the strength of their acceptance to the cold sterility of words like “ intronic acceptor splice-site mutation  on  chromosome 19p13.2–13.3.” I think about the times where I’ve been reduced to my problems, and I walk home reminding myself that I don’t want to lock myself in a little bubble of pipettes that reduces my perception of people to sequencing data and microscope images and clinical outcomes. UROP (for credit because I missed the funding deadline because I was – guess what! – hosed!; 16 units):  I wrote code. I wrote more code. I argued with people about the inputs to my function. I wrote more code. I screamed. I wrote more code. I decided that computational biology is not my thing.  I took the intermediate skating PE class in the fall, despite having been on ice all of four times prior, and then I took the figure skating class over IAP. They’re
 
surprisingly effective classes, ⁠ 04 this is really a self-roast on how clumsy I am; I once tore my ACL falling out of a chair; now imagine that but on ice  on ice; sadly, club times are from 8:00-9:30 am, and as the semester wore on, I went less and less
 behold my weird-looking jump, ft. grace and ilani dancing in the background! this is actually the BU ice rink oops  I don’t even know – I didn’t track – but  Alan gives a good description of how MIT’s units/hours are supposed to work here  hitting the triple digits is good cause to deeply reconsider all your life choices To paraphrase Alan, this schedule is a bad idea. People will tell you this is a bad idea. MIT students will tell you this is a bad idea. Most of me viscerally cringes at the idea of doing another semester like this spring. To stop paraphrasing Alan, I embraced it because it’s a bad idea. I wanted to drown in work so I could not drown in the depths of myself, because – in addition to my usual justifications – people react to surviving a semester like this by thinking of me as  smart  and  impressive  and  capable  while working on myself comes with  pity  and  what’s wrong with her  and slightly backhanded compliments like  ⁠ 05 this compliment always makes me feel like suffering makes me someone, and I don’t want to be defined by how many things can go wrong in my life There’s the start of the semester, where I try to stay a week ahead of my work and wonder when the other metaphorical shoe will drop and something would put me behind. I eat boiled eggs multiple times a day because they’re just about the easiest thing I can cook. I start a new UROP and meet my  new PI kawashiorkor 
nutritional deficiency. ⁠ 06 I didn't get scurvy or any other deficiency that I know of, but eventually my fingertips started peeling off, probably from the acid exposure of consistently peeling 5 tangerines in one go There’s week 5, where I break my brain again by accidentally consuming an
 
ungodly amount of caffeine ⁠ 07 sometimes people ask me how I <em>accidentally</em> consumed >1g of caffeine. the answer is that I fill my hydroflask with black tea instead of water; banana lounge has free coffee; 6.129 had free coffee; I went to trident cafe with a friend to study and we shared a pot of tea; and then we got boba off Too Good To Go; and suddenly it's 3 am and my walls are trying to talk to me needed  to let me go because I had an 8.02 midterm the next day and a 7.06 pset due two days later. They drug me and let me out; I take the 8.02 midterm (late) and do considerably better than I expect to; I talk to my advisor, who says  alice, please, drop a class or, actually, maybe three , and then I don’t do that. I want to curl back up into a now-coherent ball and sleep for the next week, but instead I sit on the roofdeck and churn out psets and convince myself that This Is Fine. I implement a personal rule that I do not work past midnight after this, which is a step in the right direction. There’s the end of the semester, where I’ve hopped back on the endless pset treadmill and worry whether there’s a third shoe that will drop now that I’m no longer a week ahead, truly dooming me to extension hell. I start
 
three projects ⁠ 08 There’s my Spanish final project (brought to you by the acting skills of my old UROP lab!); my 7.06 final project (where I don’t remember anything I wrote!); and an 8.02 experiment (thank god I’ve taken this class before!) I think about getting home most days and crashing on my floor, too tired to pset or find food or haul myself up onto my lofted bed to sleep; about feeling like I was hanging on to everything by a couple of stray cat hairs and fully understanding what “hosed” meant; about crashing the second I turned in my final projects and blobbing on my floor for a full two weeks after; and I swear I’m never doing this again,  ever  — — and then I check my grades, see that my semester looks near-perfect on a transcript even if it isn’t by any other metric, and the defunct meatball in my skull perks up again going:  you know what? let’s do that again. When I was much younger, adults used to say that I forgot the injury as soon as I stopped crying (“她一不哭了就给忘了伤.”) Sometimes this was said in backhanded praise, like when they were asking their kid why they hadn’t a can-do-attitude (胆子) as big as mine; other times, in exasperation, like the time I can-do-ed myself headfirst into the corner of a dining table and dented my skull because
 
I thought the chair next to it looked bouncy.  ⁠ 09 it was! And the resulting scar didn’t really stop me from wanting to try it again! Toddler me really understood the importance of reproducing results I eventually developed a healthy respect for dining tables, but the same trait contributes a lot to my workaholism. I remember the positive results of being a workaholic, and I do a good job of mentally punting the day-to-day negative impact it has on my life. I remember what it felt like for that fleeting moment where I stood on the podium at state championships; now, even as people comment on my weird gait, it doesn’t usually register that maybe swimming through degenerative joint disease  might  have been a bad idea. I remember getting into MIT; I don’t think about how the hours I spent wishing that I’d gotten to experience just a little bit of high school like a normal kid, nor how burnt out I felt by the start of senior year. I remember feeling pleasantly numb for all of this spring followed by the gratification of opening my grades and thinking  wow, I really did pull that off – maybe I’m not too broken for this place after all , and I don’t think about the three whole paragraphs of hell that I just wrote about.  In moderation, this is probably a good trait – maybe it could be called motivation, or ambition, or resilience. In its current form, it’s mostly just self-destructive, and I’m coming to realize that my approach of “do it or die trying,” is not a particularly sustainable one. It’s just a hard trait to moderate in a results-based society when its current form keeps putting more words onto my resume. Reading everyone else’s horror stories never really convinces me that I shouldn’t do it, either. Instead, it becomes almost a point of pride to me that I can do just as much and get equally good – if not better – results, and then people praise me for the results, and the positive feedback loop continues forever. At MIT, almost nobody will ever tell you to stop working. I sign up for too many classes every semester — but I tell myself that I know someone whose pre-registration looks worse than mine, so I’m doing okay by overcommitting myself slightly less than they are. I can always find more things to do in my classes. I can always think harder about my psets. I can always dodge social commitments with “Sorry, I’m hosed,” and nobody ever questions whether that’s true (because I am, and they are too, and we just accept that the hose has devoured another tiny bit of happiness from today.) Telling myself to stop working – when it’s not just MIT, but society as a whole, that rewards working and assigns value based on productivity – is really, really, really hard. Once, while talking to Petey, he mentioned that the most depressed people on campus were just-tenured-professors,  because, having earned the thing they spent and sacrificed so much in the last 20+ years on, they suddenly wonder: why? – and I thought about it, and I tried to imagine a day where I’d run out of milestones to accomplish and things to run from and
 
I’d be working for the sake of working ⁠ 10 I really do most things that I do because I genuinely love doing them. I’d major in at least three more things if I had infinite time and money; I’d still UROP even if it was irrelevant to my career plans; I’d probably still learn how to sew and CAD and code in a utopia where 'marketable skills' has no meaning. I just really like making things. Even so, there’s just not enough time for me to Do Everything, and it’s unfair to myself to slowly strip away bits of my life in an effort to keep pretending that I can. 
really strong sense of loss. ⁠ 11 'I wanted to be a normal person for a bit,' is my go to explanation for why I don't swim anymore...except I've just filled that time with psets instead of getting a life, oops This summer, I’m working on a project for iGEM with 5 other students, but it’s considerably less work than I did last summer. I’m trying to find a better balance between working and not-working, and it’s going okay in some ways. I’ve done a lot more art than I have in a long time – before, I really only drew when I wanted to procrastinate, because I could never convince myself it was okay to consciously stop and draw for fun. It’s going less okay in other ways: overworking did really effectively allow me to avoid introspection, and I am – at least transiently – much happier when I don’t think about my problems, so I spend more time sad-blobbing and less time being-productive these days.  #but maybe not all the time #I do Productive Things I promise

I wrote a  blog I feel lost on a much deeper level than ever before, and it’s not entirely negative it’s just… I feel so directionless, like I’m in the middle of a field and there used to be a road I was following and now there isn’t…. I remember this feeling very clearly, it’s something that followed me throughout my freshman year, all the way through sophomore fall. I wasn’t really certain in what I wanted to do after college, and looking at the future I saw only hazy outlines of possible paths. At some point, though, everything changed. Or, really, not that much changed, but my outlook shifted just a little bit, and everything clicked into place. I don’t feel nearly as lost anymore. This realization happened over winter break and boiled down to a couple of basic, but essential, facts: ⁠ 01 though another part of it is perhaps the fact that I wouldn't mind staying in academia forever putting 1) and 2) together, I easily arrived at None of these facts are particularly new or unexpected, and anyone who knows me will be the first to roll their eyes and say that they saw this coming since forever. Still, solidifying these things in my mind took a huge weight off of my shoulders, giving me a sense of stability and direction. There are still a lot of unknowns, possibilities, and decisions for me to explore, and I’m glad that there are, but I’m glad at least to have a road to follow for the next handful of years. So, in this post, I wanted to lay out the full context of my decision to mentally commit to grad school, as well as talk about my relationship to science in general. The post ended up being a little long, so here’s a handy table of contents, feel free to skip around (though it makes the most sense in order): The truth is, my scientific “career” started a while ago. I come from a family full of academics, so I grew up around scientists and researchers. I was taught to appreciate science from a young age, and was given ample opportunity to learn about it, for which I am eternally grateful. I often think about the question of nature vs. nurture, and the ways in which the two intersect and amplify each other. Do I love science because I come from a family of scientists? Yes, but it’s not as though anyone forced me to love it. At the same time, with the way I was raised, it’s hard to imagine me turning out any other way. In either case, it’s a moot point. I am who I am today, and the reasons don’t matter so much. At its core, I find science incredibly interesting and exciting. I love learning about it, and I love the feeling of understanding more and more about how the world around me functions. I would always seek out extra classes or material to learn about science. I remember watching Star Wars for the first time in middle school and developing a years-long obsession with astronomy; at some point, I think I read an astrophysics textbook from cover to cover, though I didn’t understand about half of the math. I joined the science bowl team in sixth grade, and kept playing through senior year. Entering
 
high school, ⁠ 02 the school I went to went from 7th to 12th grade, so middle blended seamlessly into high I could go on for a while about all the science-related things
 
I did in high school, ⁠ 03 in retrospect, I definitely did too many things, because I was deeply, fundamentally burnt out throughout much of junior and senior year, and leading into college 
a little boring, ⁠ 04 and they ate up precious lunch break time! that I could have spent practicing for science bowl... here’s me in high school with my competition poster Of course, the high school research competition environment is a little… contrived, for lack of a better word. There’s a big pressure to frame your research and results as something groundbreaking and incredibly novel, when in reality any research you do as a high schooler is unlikely to change the course of
 
your field. ⁠ 05 and people who <em>do</em> have amazing results are often products of extremely privileged environments, with research programs like my own and, often, family connections to big labs. the whole research comp circuit isn't particularly equitable, but I'm not gonna get too much into that here 
AGU and AMS, ⁠ 06 the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, respectively I remember, back when I was choosing which college to attend, I had boiled it down to MIT and one other university, also a STEM school, but much more known for its science and academia than for its engineering, entrepreneurship, or business programs. MIT, on the other hand, seemed to me a much more academically diverse place, with many outcomes for graduates other than grad school. At the time, in my senior year of high school, I knew that I would probably enjoy pursuing science as a career. It was the only career I had ever seriously considered, and I knew that if I went to that other school, I would end up in academia forever. If I came to MIT, I would at least seriously consider other paths. So, I came to MIT. On some level, I wanted to be convinced to change paths, to become a software engineer, or an architect, or to work in finance. In my first two years at MIT, I considered a lot of different majors, from
 
course 1 ⁠ 07 civil engineering 
course 16. ⁠ 08 aerospace engineering I also talked a lot to people who were on different paths than I was. It’s interesting, really. At MIT, I’m not friends with very many “scientists.” Most of my friends are majoring in either computer science or some sort of engineering, and want to go into industry after undergrad, or maybe after getting a master’s degree. In this sense, MIT has given me exactly what I wanted: exposure to the other side, to the types of jobs and lifestyles available outside of the bubble of academia. I am actually surprised at the degree to which I am surrounded by “the real world,” in as much as the privileged environment of MIT can be real. There are future scientists at MIT, of course, there are plenty, it’s just my own social circles that seem to veer in the opposite direction. I’m grateful for this. Throughout my exploration, it’s true that I didn’t go very far down any particular alternate path. In my mind, though, I wasn’t fully committed to sticking with science or even going to grad school. The most hands-on experience outside of research that I got was an IAP  micro-internship  not just for the topics it covers and the problems it addresses. Starting freshman spring, I’ve been working continuously on UROPs and other research. For a year, I worked as part of a team using novel machine learning techniques to improve weather forecasting. Since the team was mostly composed of computer scientists, a large part of my work was to conduct literature reviews and sometimes talk directly to meteorologists at different government agencies. I enjoyed this a lot, since it gave me a lot of exposure to the way weather forecasting is done and the major players involved in the field. I also worked on analyzing the quality of forecasts made by different models, which was interesting from an almost mathematical point of view. I hadn’t really thought before about the depth involved in the question “what is a good forecast?” There is a lot there to think about, though, and I find that research area fascinating. I was able to explore that question further during my freshman summer, when I worked (virtually) at the NASA
 
GMAO, ⁠ 09 Global Modeling and Assimilation Office 
how they are generated. ⁠ 10 for anyone curious: it's a difference between deterministic and ensemble forecasts Being part of both of those teams was a really cool experience in the sense that I was working on forecast models and methods that were being used operationally, or would be in the foreseeable future. I could feel directly that my work had an impact, and was contributing something to both the state of knowledge (about which forecast methods work, generally) and just… society (the users of those models). This is why I have stuck with weather and climate research for so long: not only are these topics fascinating and intellectually stimulating on a personal level, they are also impactful in a tangible way. Since this past semester, I have been working on a different UROP: a more mathematical and theoretical treatment of the question of how to make useful forecasts, this time when talking about the climate as a general system. It’s a really cool project that has pushed me a lot in terms of skills and ways of thinking, which has been difficult but rewarding. Still, it’s hard to balance everything I do at MIT with research. I spent the past semester whining about how I wish I had more time to do research, and how I would rather be doing research than whatever thing was going on
 
at the moment. ⁠ 11 that thing was often my 8.04 pset, but that's a story for another time here’s a funky looking plot from my current UROP. no context, just a break for your eyes It then becomes ridiculously simple: I want to go to grad school because I want to keep doing research. I think this is the core of what I realized this past winter: it finally clicked that the decision to go to grad school  . The fact that I enjoy doing research now and can see myself doing it for another five years after undergrad is all the reason I need. I don’t need to have a grand plan for my life, and I don’t need to commit to staying in academia indefinitely and becoming a tenured professor. There are many other jobs that a PhD would also set me up for. I could work at a government agency, like NASA or NOAA, or I could work at some company doing work related to climate modeling, or a number of other things. All of these paths would only benefit from more education. I want to go to grad school so that I can keep on learning. With every UROP and research internship that I do, I realize just how much more there is for me to learn in order to truly be able to engage with my field. The atmosphere is a ridiculously complex system, and weather and climate models both are ridiculously complex to match. There’s so much I don’t know yet about how the atmosphere functions, the laws of physics that govern it, the computational approaches that we can take to model and understand. Sometimes, I even lack the tools to understand these things: there’s so much more math I want to learn, or get better at. A constant problem throughout my undergrad career has been the feeling that I don’t have enough time. Four years just isn’t enough for me to fit in all the classes I want to take, at least not in a way where I retain their content. Plus, undergrad isn’t just about taking classes – I have other priorities, too, such as spending time with friends, pursuing creative projects, and, of course, doing research. Plus, I love being a part of a university: the ease of access to knowledge, the general academic environment, the ability to take classes in
 
completely different fields, ⁠ 12 where would I be without my emotional support french queer literature class?? I think I used to see going to grad school as “delaying my life,” so to speak. I thought that it would just be adding another five years to my schooling, and why would I want to do that when there’s a whole world out there for me to explore? I was wrong, though. Life is long, and it’s already started! This is something I wasn’t really able to appreciate in high school: that the experience of getting a college education isn’t something totally removed from the rest of the world – or, at least, it doesn’t have to be. Instead, it’s just one of the many things you do with your time, almost like a job, but not really. I find this fact easy to forget amid the busyness of MIT,  but that doesn’t make it any less true – and it only becomes more true as you get older. I think about this a lot, particularly in the context of grad school: how crazy is it that I can just keep studying, keep working on projects that I’m curious about, and get paid for it? Even if it’s not a lot of money, it’s still a way of subsisting while doing something that, at the end, is
 
purely for myself, ⁠ 13 this isn't to say that I don't think grad students shouldn't be paid more, I'm just being realistic Vincent wrote a really interesting and well-articulated  blog post I want to say that I can’t fathom working a job that I hate, or that I find boring and unstimulating. That wouldn’t be true. I can imagine it just fine, I can see it as a possible path, I know which steps I would have to take to end up sitting behind a computer, ten years from now, at some corporate office in New York or San Francisco, pushing around data that has no worth to me or the world at large. It might be nice, actually: the financial stability, the opportunities to pursue passion projects outside of work, the general ease of life associated with a stable, well-paying job. It’s just that, there’s no good reason for me to do it, at least not right now. I don’t need the money, or at least, I don’t need it enough. I’m lucky enough to be graduating from college
 
without debt ⁠ 14 big shoutout to the MIT financial aid office 
ton of money, ⁠ 15 my family is by no means poor, but we're definitely not wealthy, either In her comment on Vincent’s post, Audrey wrote, “i dont think simply getting paid less makes a job more noble.” I do agree with this. I think that if the thing that I was passionate about paid a lot of money right out of undergrad and was to some degree ethically dubious, I would still pursue it. I am not the type to put morality above all else; like most people, I like to prioritize my happiness. But it’s true, also, that I’m not passionate about pure software engineering or finance, and I can’t really imagine myself finding those fields engaging. This, too, is part of who I am. I find that I enjoy the style of work that science provides and the problems it allows me to work on. Plus, to some degree, my happiness   related to the fact that I feel like I’m not doing harm to the world. If I keep working on climate research or weather forecasting (and I probably will), I might even be doing net good. In this, too, I am lucky, and I’m not ready to throw that luck away. Of course, everything I’ve written is subject to change. I’m not ruling out the possibility of me going into
 
industry ⁠ 16 maybe even an ethically dubious one! None of this is particularly new. I talk about it as if it were a big realization, but whenever I mention it to my friends, they laugh at me – it’s not a surprise to anyone. Of course I’m going to grad school. Of course I want to keep going with research. It seems as if I was the last one to know. Though, I’ve known all along, of course. This realization is really about closing the chapter of my life where I was considering pretty much all possible career paths. I’ve cut off a ton of those possible paths, and I’ve chosen one that I will follow, for now. This is not useless realization. It allows me to focus on my research and on my science classes. It allows me to spend my time thinking not about what I want to do after I graduate, but about my relationship with science, and about the specific areas within my field that I might want to get involved with. I have found a road to follow, and I will follow it until something changes.

It is summer in Cambridge, which means that: alarming amount of tropical fruit plants million fun things happening in the Kendall/MIT Open Space share your garbage with the world What does it mean to be an admissions blogger? MIT students are the Institute’s best ambassadors. Admissions officers can explain complicated processes and provide words of wisdom, but we can’t write about what it’s like to live on Conner 2, or plan REX, or UROP, or decide how to pick your classes, or a really cool new thing you learned today in class, and so forth. The mission of the blogs is to help our students communicate what MIT is actually like. We do this by hiring students who have good judgment, a compelling voice and perspective, and the disciplined exuberance to post at least twice a month on average. We may ask you to help advise creative projects in the office and serve as a touchstone for student culture. We pay you for this work. It’s a pretty good gig, to be honest. Your application will be read by a small committee made up of AOs, senior bloggers, and a few blogger cruft. This application itself was designed mostly by student bloggers to help ask and answer the kinds of questions that might be useful for identifying their kin. Please note that *only* current MIT students may apply to be bloggers (i.e. no prospective students or students at other colleges). This application is open to all MIT undergraduates of any class year. This application will go live on 07/01/2022, and close on 07/31/2022. Anyone who has started their application by 07/31/2022 will have a grace period of 7 days to complete and submit it. We will begin reviewing applications after the grace period, and hope to select and alert bloggers before orientation if at all possible. If this sounds like something you might like to do, then  fill out the blogger application . If anything isn’t clear, let me know in the comments or via email!

Co-written by Rima Das and Amber Velez  One unique characteristic about MIT is its plethora of makerspaces. There are big basement machine shops for meche classes, little makerspaces with laser cutters or drills in many dorms, a wonky woodshop under EC, and even bio and nuclear makerspaces, if you know where to look. The issue is, it’s difficult for any one student to know where all the makerspaces are. PhD student Rima Das is working on a project to remedy that — she’s putting together a collaborative  map of MIT makerspaces  The makerspace map is a crowdsourced online map where members of the community can add pins for different makerspaces on and around campus. In addition, they’re able to add descriptions to each pin to share information about the types of making that happen in the space, how to get access, and notes about the space’s culture.   Before making this map, the most complete makerspace map we had was  this one  As a meche always looking to discover new makerspaces, I was so happy to see this map show up in
 
dormspam. ⁠ 01 ie, emailed out to all MIT dorms  If there’s one thing I know about MIT is that it’s impossible for one person to know everything about MIT! Campus is so full of different nooks and crannies that become home to different groups. I’m interested in this phenomenon, especially for makerspaces. Our campus is unique in just how many maker spaces (or spaces for making) it houses! To try and better understand where each of these spaces physically exists, I created a collaborative online map that any member of the community can add to. I hope that this becomes a living document that people can add to as they discover and interact with more spaces. Eventually, I would love it if it even starts to encompass the kinds of making that people do in their dorm rooms. I have a vinyl cutter in my GRA apartment—I think that’s a makerspace too!  That sounds amazing. Which makerspaces particularly stuck out to you?  I was amazed at just how many spaces there are on here that I didn’t know about and now I have so many I’d like to visit. The  Huang-Hobbs BioMakerSpace  is the first space I’ve ever heard of that lets students propose personal projects that involve biological and chemical experimentation. I also had no idea the  Radio Society Previous Next  I’m so excited to see this map grow. Thanks for doing this, Rima!  Thanks so much for writing about it and for being part of the maker community here! We’ll have to go visit some of these spaces and learn more!

Hi! Hello! Long time no see. It’s weird to be typing again. I feel kind of embarrassed for disappearing for a month from the blogs, especially when the blogs have been such a cozy, homey place for me, a respite among the ups and downs of my life. But things have been busy. In the time that I’ve been gone:  tolerate. At the end of my junior year, I was left with a really big decision. I was offered the opportunity to study Sociology and Anthropology at University College London for the fall semester. I felt very stuck. I feel very stuck. I’ve made a decision and even now it still doesn’t feel real. I want to go. Desperately. I want to go out into the unknown and live in a country that I haven’t lived in before, I want to explore the streets of London and meet new people and fully immerse myself in the humanities. But at the same time, I want to stay with my friends, and spend at least one more semester at MIT because so many semesters were taken away from me. So, this has been something that’s been bothering me. I’ve opted to try to ignore it. And it makes me feel guilty. Every day I keep postponing signing housing things and agreements, and sending emails back to people. I avoid even opening the acceptance page because it washes me with waves of guilt. I don’t know what to do. And I think it’s been scary to do anything related to MIT (including writing blogs) because it reminds me of the fact that I might be letting go one of one of the coolest and unique opportunities of my life. It’s a lot. There’s…a lot. I talked with a psychiatrist. Heavy chance I have ADHD. Need to do tests and scans and whatever and labs to move on with the process but surprise surprise I keep getting distracted from setting it up!! Who could’ve called that one!!! My internship requires I live in San Francisco. I…was not known to be San Francisco’s biggest fan. But I’m learning to love it! Ish. It’s really hard transitioning to San Francisco from Boston. In Boston, I can walk around alone at night. I can prance around at 1am and walk across the bridge to my house. I don’t feel in danger, the public transit is easy and makes sense, it’s walkable, it’s green, it’s clean (relatively). San Francisco is…incredibly different. I’m trying to get used to it, carrying around pepper spray and steeling myself. I don’t walk around in crop tops or sports bras anymore like I did in Boston. I wear a baseball cap and tie up my hair and wear big sweatshirts to cover myself up, one hand always on my pepper spray and the other on my bag. I wear earbuds with nothing playing so no one bothers me but so I can be alert at all times. It’s exhausting. For the first three weeks of being in San Francisco, I got harassed  I got called a slut, or I got followed, or catcalled. At one point, a man tried to hit me as he called me a “fucking slut” because I was dressed in a sports bra and pants. I wanted to cry. I complained to all my friends, even going so far as to go to Reddit and ask how to be safer in the city, only to be met with friends and commenters telling me I must be doing something wrong because they’ve “never experienced that in this city.” I felt very helpless. I’m learning to adjust, though. I know what is safe and what isn’t down to the crossroads. I know what times I can be out and what times I cannot. I know what I can wear and what I can’t. San Francisco has broken me, broken my resolve. I feel like there are so many rules placed on me because I am a young woman and it feels terrifying and sickening and overwhelming all at once, somehow. But I am trying. I’m really, really fucking trying my best. It’s just a lot right now. I’m living on my own for the first time, and I’ve really been enjoying the freedom that that has provided for me. I clean my apartment every Sunday, taking careful time to wipe down all surfaces, mop, vacuum, and scrub everything down. It’s peaceful, taking time every week to just clean and take care of my space. I’ve started cooking more. Previous Next And eating good food. Previous Next Previous Next And working out a lot. And dressing up cutely and goodly even if SF doesn’t like what I wear. Previous Next And in general doing cool things, both things I’ve done before and things I’ve never done before. I’ve been trying out pole fitness classes. They’re super duper hard but I hope to maybe continue this at MIT. They’re really fun and make me feel a lot more in touch with my body. I have a fear of heights so this was really scary for me but it was super fun. I would definitely go again. Broadway shows sometimes have something known as  , tickets you can get on the day of the show for very cheap. They release online at 9am and you can get them two hours before the show. There are usually only about max 20 of these. Some other interns and I decided to get rush tickets for a Saturday 1pm showing of Hadestown. I woke up at 7:30am and showed up at the venue at 8am to be met with literally no one. Like absolutely no one. I think I’m too used to wildly popular concerts where you have to line up three days before because I was truly in shock at the idea that no one was here. My other intern friend, who also woke up hellishly early, was slightly miffed that I made him wake up for literally no one in line. So we left the area and got brunch. At 9am, online tickets dropped and I was fortunate enough to get 2 of 10 available rush tickets. But we needed three tickets total, so we went back in line around 9:45. At that point, there was literally no one else in line aside from the three people in my group and one other guy. By the time 11am rolled around, there were only about 10 people in line and we got pretty good seats. You can see how close we were! For $40! I went thrifting on Haight with my friend Kat and my other friend from my internship Lina. We found lots of cute clothes. I also got lost here because my phone died and I panicked because I didn’t know how to get home. The Warriors happened to win the NBA championship while I’m in San Francisco so here’s us going to the Warriors Parade. It was kind of just okay. I went to a concert by myself! I’ve been doing this for a while but I got last minute pit tickets to see 5 Seconds of Summer in concert. I took an Uber to the Concord Pavillion which was about an hour out of SF with traffic. I waited in the pit from 5pm to 7pm and got decent standing room. Here’s a photo of me in front of the stage. At the end of concerts, musicians usually throw out their guitar picks and drumsticks. It’s a nice keepsake from the concert if you’re lucky enough to get one. Ashton, the drummer of 5sos, threw his drumstick into the crowd and it landed to the left of me, in the hands of some dad chaperoning his kid at the concert. The dad then threw the drumstick back into the crowd and I was so lucky that it happened to land right into my hands. I cried. Like legitimately cried. This was my third time seeing 5SOS in concert and they’ve been such a comforting band for me so I was really happy to get something from the concert. My company gives us Volunteering Time Off and so once every two weeks, my intern cohort and I go somewhere to volunteer. This day, we went to the zoo! I cleaned up a bear pen by removing bad weeds! It was fun. and speaking of internships.. It’s certainly something. I like my cohort. I like the routine of a 9-5. It’s just taken a lot of adjustment. I’ve been somewhat stressed out trying to figure out what I want to do after college and I’m gaining a lot of insight of what I want out of a fulltime position through this internship. I’ve been spending a lot of time on my own as a symptom of living alone. And it’s been really nice and peaceful to kind of just spend time by myself. I thought I couldn’t live on my own or that I would be lonely, but really I find that I am perfectly fine living my own independent life. I’ve tried so many new things in SF, but also have found joy in just sitting at home with a bunch of snacks and watching some
 
Dimension 20. ⁠ 01 Dungeons and Dragons show I don’t really have anything else insightful to say aside from: I am proud of myself for going on this journey of self discovery this summer. It may not be the most fun or exciting summer, but it’s one that is still just as necessary as all the other summers I’ve had in college. And I’m excited for the rest of it.

The first time I ever stepped on a skateboard was in 2015, which was also the year that Marty McFly time-traveled to from 1985 in  Back to the Future Part II.  I was in seventh grade. It was a week before Halloween, and I had just finished my McFly costume with a cheap skateboard from the local sports store. It was supposed to be a prop. I was subscribed to every nerd club at my school, but I was still a stupid teen.  Don’t be a poser , my 13-year-old brain said.  Ride that skateboard around on Halloween like a champ and be the coolest kid in the neighborhood. Two hours later, I came back home with a cast around my left arm. I didn’t consider getting on a skateboard again for the next six years. It wasn’t until a few weeks ago that it caught my interest again, when I realized that I told all of my friends that this was going to be  the  summer that I was going to pick up a new hobby. I haven’t started that goal, and I was getting really bored. Besides, I wanted a faster way to get around campus. I ran through several options and settled on learning how to skateboard. After asking some friends in the Class of ‘25 Discord server for recommendations, I headed over to  Orchard Skateshop cruising He got excited at the prospect of a fresh new skater and led through the process of picking out the different parts for my skateboard. Let me tell you, I really underestimated what skateboarding entails. Like, I had no idea that skateboards could actually  bend  from side to side, or that the size of the wheels actually mattered. Essentially it’s still just a board on wheels, but details like these help customize your board so that it suits your experience level and motive for skateboarding. Before I get into the rest of the post, I need to emphasize this:  bending the knees made the process a lot easier than it could’ve been. 
Seriously. ⁠ 01 You see this in some other sports, too. Taekwondo sparring, tennis, volleyball—in all three sports, our coaches kept telling us to bend our knees for the same reasons. I got a safety-certified helmet approved for skateboarding, wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads. I already had a pair of flat-soled shoes that I could use for riding without worrying about it getting scuffed up by griptape. Actually getting myself to step on the board was a physical and mental struggle. Rationally, you know that the board is going to move when you step on it because the laws of physics exist.  Underneath the depths of rational thought, though, lurks a primal instinct that  strongly  prefers not to be on a hazardous rolling strip of wood. That’s what you gotta overcome. I put my board on the grass first so it wouldn’t slide back and forth while I got used to the footing. From there I figured out my stance was regular-footed. That’s good, because then I didn’t have to decide which foot I wanted to push off with. If you’re pushing regular, you push off with your back foot. If you push mongo, you push off with your front foot. Since I’m regular-footed and I push regular, I push off with my right foot. Second milestone was getting onto the board on concrete ground while holding onto support. I used this brick wall that runs along the sidewalk behind Baker House and Kappa Alpha Theta, and it works really well because there’s these bricks that jut out of the surface every so often that I could use as grips. Was it scary? Very. My primal instincts were pretty much screaming at me to get off the board every time it inched forward. After thirty-something tries,
 
something clicked ⁠ 02 Specifically, I figured out where to place my right foot towards the back of the board so that it would stabilize and not move any further. Now the fun part! This was pretty much learning how to shift my front foot whenever I wanted to give my board a push. I knew how to balance on a stationary board, but now I had to balance on a moving board. It took a while to get used to it. Pivoting my front foot on the board every time I wanted to shift between riding and pushing was nerve-racking, as well as getting my back foot on the board and re-establishing my balance while the board’s in motion. I’ve said it already and I’ll say it again, but bending the knees really, really helped. Cambridge Common was where I got more comfortable with riding on the board for extended periods of time. It’s a great place to practice if you’re starting out. There’s a lot of space, the paths are flat and straight (which was great because I didn’t know how to steer), and there’s grass flanking either side of the paths if you need a soft place to fall. 
I spent three afternoons there ⁠ 03 I also skateboarded in Harvard Yard a ton because I liked the paths there, but I don't...know if I was allowed to? The best thing about skateboarding probably is that anywhere (that isn’t explicitly prohibiting skateboarding) can turn into a riding spot. It doesn’t matter how pretty or fancy a place is; as long as it’s relatively smooth ground, it works. The world’s your playground.

cw: harassment (noted before the section where it’s mentioned, skip to the next pictures from there if needed!) “What’s your favorite type of metal?” asked a volunteer after Copenhell. We’d been talking about engineering, both civil and mechanical. “Uhh, copper?” “No, like, music.” “Oh. The screaming kind’s pretty cool.” Last week brought me to Copenhell, the biggest music festival in Denmark dedicated to metal. Tickets have been sold out since before the pandemic, but volunteers could get in free. I signed up for two twelve-hour shifts deconstructing the stages, and voila! Four-day festival tix! A friend of mine volunteered as well. I sacrificed my best chapstick to the Copenhell gods. It fell out of my pocket on the first night. While waiting in line, my friend and I came up with bucket list items for my first metal fest: crowdsurf get a tattoo (apparently at the metal fests in Scotland, which are bigger than Copenhell, there are legit tattoo parlors set up among the vendors) get on the big screen try the festival beer ride on someone’s shoulders throw up in the port-a-potty toilets get in the mosh pit I thought #6 sounded unpleasant and strove to avoid this. And
 
succeeded! ⁠ 01 I will add, however, that the toilet situation at Copenhell was one of the best I’ve ever seen at any large event. The toilets consistently worked, and there was paper, soap, and running water available every single time. After several years in the queue line, we got in. Nearly everyone was dressed in black; the most color you saw was the in band emblems on shirts. Silver chains and rings — on ears, noses, lips — caught the sun.  The festival itself took the ‘hell’ in Copnenhell quite literally. The stands and stages were all dressed in black. Vendors’ names heavily featured the Devil; the coffee stand was called Doom Coffee. There were pennants on the hill with upside-down crosses. I had expected none of this and took it in with glee. I ran into the first shop I saw, pawed through band shirts that I’d usually find only in the back of thrift shops, and rarely in my size. Here there were shirts with bands I listened to — and not just Pink Floyd, either — that actually fit me.  Previous Next The entire venue was immense, with four stages and more acts than you could listen to — especially coming after work, as I was. I sort of like that, though, this feeling that you’re in a space too big to explore all of it.  Before entering any crowds, my friend and I set up camp on the hillside and watched Gloryhammer from afar. I drank in the crowd below us, their tattoos and piercings, leather and over-long hair. We matched the aesthetic. Ahead of us, there was a sea of people bouncing before the lead singer. At the end of a song, a wave of hand-horn symbols rose from the crowd. I understood for the first time why that symbol, the rock one with the pointer finger and pinky raised, meant rock music. The headliners on the first night were Metallica. I wore the same shirt as several dudes in the crowd, ages 20-something to 70.  My friend and I met some other people we knew and made our way into the crowd. I got up on my friend’s shoulders, looked out over the crowd. And then I found the mosh pit during ‘Enter Sandman.’ The chaos swallowed me, and I was thrown between bodies, singing along although no one could hear, while Hetfield’s voice resounded around us.  Previous Next cw: harassment. Not discussed after the next set of photos, so skip ahead if needed! Take care of yourself <3 I’m soaking up vibes, collecting details that will make their way into some narrative, sometime. I’m figuring out which patterns ring true. I like this feeling of finding a new space which suits me, if not perfectly, then at least decently well.  I’m telling stories of this festival. I like most of the facets of this space I’ve found. I met with a female coworker on the second day, and said,  whatever feminism’s been doing for the last thirty years is working. People are chill. Strangers offer to put you on their shoulders when you can’t see over the crowd. They push me out of mosh pits, and I wish they didn’t, but they’re trying to protect me. I am much smaller than they are. And when I go in again, they realize I meant to be there. We push each other around and choke on dust. The next day, to a different coworker, I said,  whatever feminism’s been doing, it’s making progress. Strangers offer to put you on their shoulders, and they lean in to make out afterwards, but when you deny them, they don’t actually assault you. I don’t know what it was, the third day of the festival, but I couldn’t keep strangers’ hands off me. My friend remarked, as we exited a crowd, that every time he turned around I was snapping at someone. I said I wished I had been meaner. “You don’t fucking touch people without permission,” I told a thirty year old dude. He neither apologized nor denied it, just said, “Not anymore.” It’s interesting, having a good time while trying to be safe, knowing that no matter how much you try, you are not guaranteed to actually  be  safe; and trying to have a good time anyway.  That isn’t a new narrative for a lot of people. This particular event just happened to be more dangerous than the spaces I normally occupy. I got on this guy’s shoulders during Death to All and he asked if I was okay. I said yes, I was fine. His strength belied for a moment how drunk he was. But when he walked forward, his gait was steady; I didn’t worry about him falling. At that moment I was the only person on someone else’s shoulders, looking at a sea of metalheads, devil’s horns thrust to the stage. The singer pointed right at me. I raised both hands. The guy below me moved closer to the front, avoiding the flow of crowdsurfers. He held my legs with one hand, more tightly than needed. He was strong and I wondered if he would be the exception to the rule, if when he let me down and leaned in and I refused him he  wouldn’t  take no. The bass was gorgeous in my ears and the singer was screaming now, up close. I was cheering. The guy below me asked someone beside him if I was okay. I gave him thumbs-up. I thought that I should get down soon, while I was anticipating the danger. I asked him to get down. He did. He leaned in and I moved quickly away. “Are you good?” I said yes, thank you, held a thumbs-up far out in front of me. He didn’t try anything.  He and I went separate ways through the crowd. I returned to cheering Death to All. They were a fucking awesome band. I tried writing this blog without this section, but it felt disingenuous. The third night, I recorded every bad
 
experience. ⁠ 02 and the majority did not come from interactions I responded to, like riding someone’s shoulders I decided consciously then to still have a good time the next day. To wear the same thing, because even if my shirt showed shoulders and cleavage and maybe attracted more attention, I’d face harassment either way. So I might well go to this festival in the clothes I like.  I  could  wear that shirt, and mosh in the hearts of crowds, and tell men “don’t fucking touch me” without fearing a violent response too much, because a lot of people before me came here with chips on their shoulders, determined to take up space whether or not the crowd wanted them to. There has been progress. And there needs to be more. So I chose to enjoy the festival and the scene despite these nasty, massive flaws, which we’ll try to iron out in my lifetime. I don’t think we’ll succeed. But we’ll get closer.  At the end of the last mosh, which had turned into a spiral, a bunch of people running in a circle and kicking up dust, the only other woman in the circle hugged me and I threw up devil’s horns, like  yeah, motherfucker, we got this. Iron Maiden the food court KISS Thundermother I came in hoping to discover new bands, and man, there were so many! Alestorm and Gloryhammer are fun and fantasy-esque, like a harder version of stuff I listened to years ago.  I prepped for Thundermother, who were great; Hellacopter was awesome too. Both are sorta hard rock. Best of all, in the middle of the crowd before Baest — a Danish band that doesn’t sing, just employs the sort of screaming that sounds like it’s shredding your vocal cords — I discovered that I love the sound of false cord
 
screams ⁠ 03 I looked into it later and it turns out you make the sounds in your false cords, which are above the vocal cords, so the vocal cords are undamaged I’d struggled to get into this type of hard heavy metal, as it’s not ideal when played through my tinny android speakers, and not the most optimal soundtrack for studying thermo — too close to my inner monologue. But in the middle of a crowd? Sounds amazing. I cheered for Baest, then kept an eye out for anything that sounded similar. I found Bersaerk that night, Death to All the next day, Opeth, and, a personal favorite, Jinjer.  Jinjer is a Ukranian band, and the lead singer, Tatiana Shmailyuk, explained that she was making this appearance to bring awareness to the war. According to a friend who worked backstage, she also brought coffee to her crew after the set. Maybe it’s ignorant of me, but I hadn’t fully realized that women can scream like that. Shmailyuk totally could. Previous Next During the festival, I mostly hung out with people I already knew. I met some interesting strangers, though. There was a girl with snakebite piercings who threw herself into the middle of mosh pits, which as a rule here were occupied by six-foot-tall men. There was a blacksmith from the UK behind me in the merch line; we talked shop while waiting for T-shirts. During the two days of volunteering that followed the festival — twelve-hour shifts, but carried out with a healthy regard for breaks and coffee — I met all sorts of musically-inclined folk. The civil engineering student whose favorite metal is not copper described in a sleep-deprived haze how drilling into the ground works in Denmark, where the earth isn’t very solid. He also translated all the Danish instructions for me during work. The lead on deconstruction, a contractor from Latvia, had a seemingly endless supply of wild stories which I cannot repeat here without his pizzazz. And one of the stages we took down folded up and  became a truck! the crowds for Iron Maiden were too thick to move through After Iron Maiden the final night, my friend and I got vegan burgers and sat in the food court, nestled between three stages, which were were positioned so that we could only hear the music from one. We harkened back to the bucket list: neither of us had thrown up, in toilets or otherwise, so it was tragically incomplete. We also hadn’t been able to find any tattoo parlors. But everything else? I’d ridden on a lot of strangers’ shoulders. The festival beer was pretty good. One of the times I got in the mosh pit, a giant European guy looked at me, bewildered, and said, “Why are you here? You are small!” Multiple times, older women in the crowd would ask me if I wanted to crowdsurf, and given the affirmative, they would get the attention of tall people nearby — their partners? Strangers to us both? I was never sure — and say, in English or Danish, “lift her up.” And the crowd came through, a handful of people working together to lift me overhead. It’s a wonderful feeling. A   of people crowdsurfed here — if you stood near the front for some bands, close to the mosh pit but not too close, you were in the middle of a highway of crowdsurfers. A good run, my friend and I agreed. I would find out at work the next week that I’d gotten on the big screen, too! Festival-goers destroyed the grass on the hillside, and the final day saw dust rising from everywhere, not just the well-trampled ground of the mosh pits. I got home that final night coated in dust, marked with bruises of unknown origin and other people’s spilled beer — at least I hoped that it was only beer. I showered off the worst of it and curled in bed, jotting down all the details I could. I was overflowing with music, though already the glory was fading, and exhaustion settled in its place. I’ll find that wonder again, in the heart of a different crowd, somewhere down the line. Rock on! Previous Next Copenhell shuttle, bus no. 666

Janice: Hey! Thanks for making time for this. CJ: No problem. Janice: I know it’s been months since we’ve last talked, but now that you’ve been here for more than a month, I wanted to check in and find out how you’re doing. CJ: It’s been great! I like the company so far. Janice: That’s good. CJ: But I’ve also been thinking about a lot of questions… Xian: I used to worry about being the oldest intern in our cohort, since I’m two years into my master’s program. The first few weeks, I was like, oh my god, everyone is so young. CJ: Well, even if that were true, it’s not like you’re the oldest person in the company by any stretch. Xian: I realized that, after talking to the rest of my team. There’s people who’ve been in the industry for decades now. I can’t imagine that. CJ: Yeah, I’ve been trying to think about whether I want to do this after I graduate too. I mean, I can do a master’s, or if I’m given a return offer, I could take it, or I could try to look for some other job. But I don’t know. I guess that’s also one thing I’ve been curious about too. Why did you decide to do a master’s? Xian: The main reason is that I wanted to learn more about systems. CJ: …because you graduated as an advertising major. Right. Xian: I was interested in learning more about databases, and distributed systems, and operating systems, so I’m doing a master’s. CJ: But you’re here as  a frontend intern Xian: Yeah. I’m looking to pivot more into backend and full-stack roles. Because I find it more interesting. CJ: It’s also a better title, too. More money. Xian:   Yeah. That too. Anna: What do you think about the internship so far? CJ: I like it. I mean, it’s only been three weeks, but I like it so far. Anna: That’s good. CJ: I guess I just find it weird, the thought of doing this for years and years after I graduate, you know? I mean, sure, I’ve liked it now. And I’ll probably like the next two months. But when you think about years, that’s just like, so long. Anna: Yeah. I guess we’re not really at the vantage point to pass judgment at it. CJ: But by the time we are at that point… Anna: …then it’s already done, right? We’ve  already made the choice CJ: So what are you doing then? You’re an incoming senior too, right? Anna: Kinda. I have one more semester before I graduate. CJ: And then what? What are your plans after graduating? Anna: I dunno. I was thinking to go into software engineering, like this job. Because like, what else is there to do? I don’t want to go into grad school. It doesn’t seem like I have any other options. CJ: Mhm. Anna: It just feels like… I’m locked in to this choice, you know? I just don’t really know what other possibilities there are. CJ: One of the…   problems I’ve been thinking about, these past few days, is what I want to do after I graduate. Lillian: You’re a senior, right? CJ: Yeah. And the only thing I’ve done before this was a UROP at a lab that I didn’t like. And I’m not sure if it’s because I didn’t like being in academia, or because everything was remote. Now I’m thinking the same thing about this internship. Do I like it because it’s a good fit in a good company, or because things are in-person and I’m in a new city? Lillian: Well, why did you choose to work here in the first place? CJ: That’s the thing.   I don’t know. Lillian:   You don’t know? CJ: Well, that’s not entirely true. I know I said during interviews that I wanted to experience working in industry, but I didn’t have any other goals than that. I just had these vague notions of   career growth. Lillian:   Okay. CJ: This is like, what, your fourth internship? So what’s different about this company compared to the other ones you’ve worked in? I mean, we’re a startup and all, so I imagine the size feels different. Xian: Even if we’re a startup, this is actually the largest engineering team I’ve worked with. CJ: Oh? Xian: Well, my first internship was in marketing, so that doesn’t count. My second one was in a big company, but I only worked on a side project with a research team, of about ten people. It was a co-op, so we were almost all interns. CJ: I see. Xian: My third internship was at another startup, but one that was even smaller than this one. The whole company had only fifty people. Here, we have over a hundred engineers. So this is actually my largest company. CJ: That’s neat. So what would you say the difference is, then, being in a larger company? Xian: Hm. One thing I’ve noticed is that, the bigger the company, the more people you have to talk to. CJ: How so? Xian: Well, right now I’m working on a feature, right? I’m looking at the existing code, and it was written by some person. Then I need to work on the design, and for that I’m working with another person. Then I’m asking about our design system, created by a different person, and then on another piece of code, it’s a fourth person. CJ: And it wasn’t like that elsewhere? Xian: When I worked in smaller places, I always knew who wrote which part. I could go directly to them and ask them about it. Here, even if I   know who wrote which part, the other person might be in another timezone, or someone not in my team, so they’re harder to reach. CJ: So what do you feel about that? Is that a bad thing? Xian: I mean, not really. It’s neither better nor worse. Just different. CJ: The other reason I wanted to come here was the people. I mean, I only had two choices for this summer, and the reason I chose to go here was because  I vibed more with the people I talked to Lillian: That’s good to hear. I’m glad you chose to go here. CJ: Yeah, me too. That’s one of the things I’ve figured out about what I want to do after college: I want to be around people I like. Lillian: That’s nice. I think being around people you like is a respectable want. CJ: But isn’t it true that I can find that in many other places? I can go and do my master’s and that’d still be true, or I can go to another company, and I’m pretty sure I can find that too. I guess the question I’m figuring out is: is that   I want? I have the feeling that I’m missing out on something more, but I don’t know if that’s true. Lillian: Well, I think a lot of people, at your age, don’t know what they want later in life. And I think surrounding yourself with people you enjoy being with is a good way to figure it out. CJ: Mhm. Lillian: It could be worse. You could wander off aimlessly, without an immediate purpose at all. Then it’d be harder to figure out what   you want in the future, without having something that you know you   want to contrast it with. CJ: That’s fair. I do know that my want to be around people I like is pretty strong. Lillian: I guess that’s not really helpful advice. CJ:   No, I’ll take it! Janice: When I was an intern at this much bigger company, I had the time of my life. I was in a new city, with a lot of cool intern friends, and I’d look forward to going to lunches and talking with them. CJ: Mhm. Janice: And after that, I knew, I   wanted to work at a company like that again. CJ: Oh? Janice: Yeah. I was working on things that had this small impact. It’s true that I got to own this one small part from beginning to end, but I wanted more, you know? CJ: I see. I think I can empathize with seeing the impact that your work has, and wanting to own a good chunk of the product. But I guess part of it must also be just liking to code, because I come across so much code that’s from you. Janice:   Yeah. Do   like software engineering? CJ: I think I do, yeah. I’ve really enjoyed this past month here. And although it’s hard to think about  the scale of years Janice: Mhm. CJ: You said it yourself, months ago, while I was being recruited, right? The company’s growing so quickly, that it’s going to be hard to tell whether it’ll be the same in a year. So I wouldn’t know what I’d be signing up for. Janice: Yeah. I think we doubled the number of engineers since our interview a few months ago. CJ: Exactly. And so while right now, it feels like I’m owning a good chunk of the product, that I’m making changes that will definitely help customers… I’m not sure if that’ll be the same once we’ve doubled again. Will our teams get bigger, or will we add more teams? Janice: Mhm. Well, one piece of advice I like to give is that you can only connect the dots in retrospect. The only way to know what it’s like in a year is to come back in a year and find out yourself. photo by  javier allegue barros CJ: I guess one thing I’m curious about is, why are   here, then? What’s your reason for choosing this company? Lillian: Well, as an engineering manager, I wanted to work with a larger group of engineers. All my previous companies were smaller, and I wanted to get the experience of rapid growth. CJ: I see. Lillian: This is, after all, my fourth startup. CJ: Your fourth?  Lillian: Is that surprising? CJ: No, it’s just that this is Xian’s fourth startup too. Lillian: Oh! CJ: Or, well, third. I can’t count. CJ: I know we’ve talked about why you chose to come to this company. Janice: It   part of recruiting you, yes. CJ: You said liked working on large problems, that you found joy in engineering. I can relate to that too. But what I’m more curious about is, well, why did you  ? Janice: That’s a good question. I’ve been here for almost four years now. And there were definitely times during those four years, when I’ve taken those recruiting calls, and read those LinkedIn messages more carefully. Maybe it was the pandemic, but I felt restless. I kept wanting to try something new. CJ: But you stayed anyway. Janice: Yeah. Because I kept finding that new thing to work on. There’s so many fun problems here. And we know that the thing that retains and attracts engineers is fun problems. That’s part of our culture. CJ: Cool. Janice: Cool. CJ: Right. So. Janice: So? CJ: So yeah! That’s what I’ve been doing these past five weeks.  Soulsearching Janice:   Soulsearching and coding! Not a bad way to spend your summer.

text in the art for accessibility (and because my handwriting is very mediocre): I’m living in New York City this summer. Oh stranger, it’s … a lot.  Brown puddles of mystery city juice. Perpetually gridlocked traffic. Narrow scaffolds under which I’m barely squeezing past crowds. Seeing so many people, so many of you, makes me feel anxious and invisible.  You and I hold onto the same pole as the C express train zooms halfway across Manhattan without stopping. Life here is so fast paced. You’re leaving me behind.  The moments where my life crosses yours may be fleeting, but I’ll try to find my peace in this sprawling city, in you.  You munch on pizza from the place underneath my apartment, as I people watch from the fire escape. We listen to a drag queen read children’s books in the middle of The Metropolitan Museum. I flip through your zine about quitting grad school. I draw you at an “underground” figure drawing event.  You make me wonder if I’d be a comic artist in another life. Illustrating stories from my life interwoven with yours. Maybe I could be one in this life too. A stranger told me so at Washington Square Park.  Stranger, I must go. You may never sleep, but I definitely do. The glittering city lights flood through the gaps between my window blinds. They make falling asleep harder, but oh are they beautiful.  inspired by  comic: métro by Jude ’21  by Tillie Walden #stay gold #zine

A couple weeks back, Winnie reminded me that the  
Dragon Boat Festival existed ⁠ 01 At some point in my childhood my mom definitely made me read up on traditional holidays, but at some other point in my childhood, I started remembering holidays by the food…oops 
“those rice tamale things,”  ⁠ 02 Because Winnie speaks Taishanese (a variant of Cantonese) and I picked up impressively little Cantonese growing up, our ability to communicate in Chinese is Pretty Limited. Granted, we only attempt to do so with food items — and I can kind of dredge up some memory of what my dad might’ve called this food — but even so, the only words I definitely know are “shrimp dumplings” and “trash” and I end up using a pinyin keyboard and Google Images to help me out half the time. Since it’s celebrated on the
 
fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar  ⁠ 03 this corresponds to sometime in May or June — it’s not consistently the same day in the Gregorian calendar. It turns out that trying to make not-well-known-Chinese-food in Boston is remarkably harder than it is back at home. At home, we probably had half the supplies from the prior year — or I could probably go ask a neighbor for some if we really hadn’t any on hand — and the local Asian/Hispanic grocery definitely had whatever perishables we’d need in relatively reasonable quantities. Here, I go to H-Mart hoping to hunt down some bamboo leaves and sticky rice, the former of which they did not have, which I only discovered after trying to talk to multiple employees in English and Spanish before defaulting to my usual “pinyin and Google Images” tactic. I give up on H-Mart and walk three miles to Chinatown, where I do find bamboo leaves…and pork belly, in massive quantities. I ask the nice man at the meat counter for a pound of it. I walk away with five pounds of it. He also offers to sell me no less than three pounds of tiny dried shrimp, at which point I think about my overflowing fridge, my hatred for seafood, and Winnie’s shrimp allergy, and I leave having decided that authenticity is overrated. At some point, I also manage to rope
 
Dylan ⁠ 04 Dylan, thankfully, does speak Mandarin, but I think I’m going to live by my pinyin and Google Images strategy from now on. There are several ways to make zongzi. There is a proper way — the kind seen in every youtube tutorial of this online — where you take a single leaf and somehow fashion it into a tiny little pyramid of rice-containing goodness with origami magic. There’s also the way I’ve made zongzi more or less every year as a kid, where my mom is an electrical engineer and lived by the idea that structural integrity was the only important aspect of zongzi beyond taste, and so I’d never actually learned how to make them beyond “haphazardly surround rice using 2-3 (maybe 4?? depends on bad you are at this) leaves and a metric ton of string and pray (to any and all deities out there) that they stay intact.” Winnie, a course 2, likes this reasoning. Winnie also pulls up a tutorial on how to do it properly, unlike Dylan and I (who are determined to do this IKEA-furniture-style), but gives up on aesthetics and goes back to making extremely-structually-sound zongzi pretty quickly. Dylan’s predictably a little more concerned about topology, given that he just took a class on topology. Unfortunately, being theoretically good at topology doesn’t really translate to executing it in the kitchen: To his credit, he’s the first one out of all of us to make anything even vaguely resembling a pyramid. It’s a pretty good pyramid, too. Unfortunately,
 
Dylan also can’t reproduce it. ⁠ 05 “at least I tried,” says Dylan, “and that’s more than can be said for a lot of papers out there.” At some point, Dylan asks me what major-specific trope my zongzi should fill, given that I’ve already laughed at his topological troubles and Winnie’s “screw-this-they’re-structurally-sound” approach. I tell him they’re not alive and therefore my classes are not applicable, but this turns out to also not be true. I just make really consistently mediocre lumps. Eventually, I figure out the pyramid thing, and then they become consistently mediocre pyramids. Maybe my only superpower is consistency, gained from pipetting one too many 96-well-plates. These days, the idea of home brings up a lot of complicated feelings for me. I haven’t been back in almost two years, and most days I like it that way. Still, sometimes I crave the ability to Go Home and be off campus and pretend that MIT-stress will never reappear in my life. Sometimes I miss the ritual of making too many well-tied zongzi and eating them out of the fridge for the next six months.  We make some weird shapes. We eat some weird exploded shapes, courtesy of Dylan’s topologically-correct-but-structurally-unstable construction. We stuff the rest into an already-overfull fridge, and it feels oddly like I’m home and away from home all at once in the best way possible. #Cooking #East Campus #summer #they're gone at the time of writing and now I'm hungry ;-;

 my first extended stay in the san francisco (henceforth abbreviated as sf) bay area was last spring, when i lived in the city, specifically in the nob hill district near downtown. i didn’t know much about sf at the time, so i learned a lot – every time i wanted to visit a new district in the city, i’d read up on that area’s developmental history until i felt like i understood its general feel. i learned how the soma district is confusing to navigate because a silly surveyor decided to align it with a road  45 degrees offset heavy contamination relocate chinatown of course, any exploration into sf’s development must eventually touch on its ongoing housing and homelessness crises. this is an expansive and very complicated subject that i don’t think i’m qualified to write about in detail, so i will try to give a concise summary based on my understanding of the topic and link you to some of the articles i’ve read  space in sf is fundamentally constrained by its position at the 7 mile x 7 mile tip of a peninsula. furthermore, the city enacted strict  regulations  in the 1960s, such as banning buildings more than four stories tall in most places and making it easy for neighbors to block construction projects. cheaper forms of housing actually decreased in quantity over the late 20th century because tens of thousands of smaller properties such as  sros  were demolished and replaced with larger apartments that housed fewer, but more wealthy, tenants. finally, the movement of tech companies to the bay area has resulted in a large influx of upper-middle-class tech workers. the result of all these factors is rapidly rising housing prices and widespread gentrification, with many working-class sf residents being  priced out  of the limited supply of housing it has become common to see tents on sidewalks in arbitrary streets, especially in the denser and lower-income districts of sf such as the  tenderloin supervised campsites iii.  in may i was hanging out with one of my friends at school. we walked through an area around central square that was undergoing rapid development and gentrification largely as a result of being near campus, so i pointed that out and mentioned that the same would likely be true of whatever area of new york they moved to after graduation. and then my friend, usually one of the most empathetic people i know, said  well, that sounds bad for the people being displaced, but it won’t affect us, right? i wasn’t expecting a statement of such blatant disregard and didn’t know how to respond to it, so i mumbled something about how it would affect us in the form of increased crime and homelessness rates. i don’t think that was very convincing though, and for a long time afterwards i wondered if i could’ve said something more persuasive .  a few weeks ago i visited  salesforce park  with a friend. we got into the elevator and saw a man already waiting inside. he looked disoriented and appeared to not be having a good time in general – for instance, he had trouble staying upright and didn’t seem to understand how to use the elevator buttons. the man pointed at my friend and said  you a queen , and then he pointed at me and said  you a n*****, you a black man i subscribe to the belief that people are usually mean to others because of personal distress or suffering that they aren’t able to properly resolve. so when the man said  you a n***** , i was disturbed, not because i felt personally insulted, but because i wondered what he was experiencing that made him feel the urge to say that of course, there could’ve been any number of reasons for the man’s behavior and i’ll never know what the real reasons were. perhaps he was mentally unstable or hallucinating. perhaps he had a long-standing grudge against people who look chinese. perhaps it was something as arbitrary as him not liking my clothes or backpack or hair. there is another potential reason i want to highlight, not because i think it is the most probable one, but rather because it relates to an issue that has been bothering me for the past year – that issue is the growing divide between the tech world and everything else some long-time sf residents hate tech workers for the changes they have wrought on the city. internet discourse on sf is littered with comments like  this one , where an sf native on quora explains how he takes comfort in the possibility that tech newcomers might be beaten up while walking around at night; a few years ago there were widespread protests against  google busing employees  between sf and the office every day; and so on. i think it is difficult to fault these people for reacting in this way, because tech has objectively made many of their lives much harder. this is maslow’s hierarchy of needs at work – i can say as much as i want about emotional or cognitive health and the importance of approaching strangers with openness, but all that matters very little for someone without physical or economic security. so if i had to guess why the man called my friend a queen and me a n*****, resemblance to tech worker stereotypes would also be one of my guesses in addition to all the obvious ones i ignored the man in the elevator, but i wonder if i should’ve said something instead. maybe he just wanted to be listened to – in which case, should i have tried to start a conversation? maybe he didn’t mean anything by his outburst – in which case, should i have laughed along? or maybe he really did hate me because of race or occupation or some other reason – in which case, should i have apologized? whatever pain or animosity or insanity he might have accumulated throughout his long life – was there anything i could have said to help soften it? i know that words alone are not solutions to suffering, that they are cheap, but that cheapness also means they can be given away freely. so what should i have given away then?  here is what i wish i had told my friend.  but it won’t affect us, right?  they asked to which i should have said:  even if you never have to live through it yourself, you’ll be watching people around you suffer every day. and even if you don’t mind seeing people suffer, you’ll still face the problem in a hundred other ways you will experience it as a city that blocks your buses and despises your appearance and prays against your safety. you will pay for it by living in a world that hates you i am an undergrad at mit, and it is a foregone conclusion that most of my friends will move to the bay area or new york after graduation to work in generic b2b sass tech and quantitative finance roles. i don’t want to dismiss these jobs as useless, but they’re definitely much lower impact than the kinds of problems mit students could be solving with their intelligence the charitable take on this is that my friends have found a way to decouple life from work, and are pursuing income-maximizing jobs so they can focus on improving their actual lives. the uncharitable take on this is that they have not found a problem they are more passionate about than the accumulation of wealth. of course i am generalizing and simplifying, but i think both of these views are true for the most part i have known about the relative wages of different jobs for a few years, but i still cannot wrap my head around how my classmates and i can make so much money sitting in front of computers and producing essentially nothing of value while other people work long hours and still cannot afford basic shelter. and i mean “nothing of value” quite literally – two years ago i was at faang building a product that has mostly gone unused; last year many people i know did trading internships that, in their own words, amounted to playing a series of betting games; and this year one of my friends worked 30 minutes a day in a full-time role at bloomberg while getting good reviews from his manager vii .  several people, living in different cities in the us, have told me that it is common to hear locals in their area compare the influx of new tech and finance employees to an infestation of bedbugs. i dislike this analogy, because i think it is unnecessarily dehumanizing and misleading. the comparison i prefer to make instead comes from  the great gatsby :  “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” sometimes this is how i feel about myself and my friends – hiding behind wealth, apathetic towards the world, upending lives without noticing. basically every high schooler in the usa is required to read  the great gatsby  and most of them come out of the experience disliking tom and daisy, but i worry that somehow, only a few years out of high school, we are forging an entire class of adults in their image unfortunately i have no solutions in this blog post, only complaints and laments. i wish i knew how to solve the absurdly complex problems of macroeconomics and wealth inequality. and just as much as i wish i could solve systemic problems, i also wish i could better affect the people i see every day. i wish i could pull tom and daisy out of their vast carelessness, and i wish i could pull the man in the elevator out of his vast suffering

 one of my coworkers, john, lives on a boat. last sunday, father’s day, john invited me and two other members of my team, joseph and claire, to his boat for a sailing trip. in the hours before we set sail, we ate brunch at a packed dumpling place, as he explained the basics of sailing to us. he took three chopsticks and arranged them as he explained. one along the length of the boat, and two for the sails. he took the pen he wrote with, and pointed it at the boat. the chopstick and the pen were head-to-head, and in this example, the boat and the wind were in opposite directions. “the pen’s the direction of the wind,” said john. “knowing that direction is important. you’ll need to develop a sense for it.” “isn’t there a wind indicator on the top of the boat?” asked joseph. “yes,” said john. “but don’t look up. feel it against your cheeks, or your ears. look at the water, look at other people’s hair.” wind direction was so vital, looking up would waste time; that was the lesson he wanted us to learn. “you have to adjust based on how the wind is blowing,” said john. “and so, we begin with one of the most important questions in sailing: how do you sail against the direction of the wind?” joseph, claire and i sat and traded glances. silence stretched among us as i thought about the question. “can you?” i asked. “the short answer,” john replied, “is that you can’t.”  in my continued adventures with the american healthcare system, i learned that my psychiatrist and therapist couldn’t schedule appointments with me while i was in california. something about being in different states, even if the appointments were virtual. my psychiatrist found me a practice covered by my insurance, and i went through their intake process to get an initial appointment. i had my meeting with dr licorish on a tuesday morning, during an hour off work. we talked about my  complex psychiatric history in either case, we chatted about different patterns of depression and anxiety. he talked about what he’d heard from other people’s experiences, and his own theories, which i appreciated. he’d seen two broad kinds of depression. one comes and goes on the scale of days, affected by the events in someone’s life. the other one lasts for weeks at a time, without reason or pattern behind. losing interest in a hobby you used to be passionate about, with things formerly joyful turned to chores. like being blown by erratic winds, ones that shifted direction whenever you watched them. and that’s the struggle. the one i felt when, last thursday, writing blog posts turned from a source of comfort to a drag. or when, last friday, i had dinner with some friends in sf, and i couldn’t bring myself to enjoy the company. or when, last saturday, i found no fun working on huntinality’s puzzles, even if i looked forward to it for weeks.  “how   you sail, then,” asked claire, “if you wanted to go against the wind?” “you don’t,” said john. he tilted the three chopsticks, forming an angle with the pen. the boat was no longer head-on with the wind, yet still pointing close forward. he reproduced the image on the notebook he’s been writing on. “oh,” i said. “you move diagonally forward.” “and then,” said claire, “you change direction, so you keep moving forward.” john nodded. to move forward, you zigzagged, so you never directly sailed against the wind. the maneuver of going in one direction, then turning about ninety degrees to go the other direction, was called  . there were nuances to that. there was a region called the no-sail zone, so you couldn’t point your boat too close to the wind. but that was the principle. “i’ll show you when we get on the boat,” said john. “since this is your first time, cj and claire, the main thing you’ll do is tacking. i’ll handle the rest with joseph’s help.” he was interrupted by a server, who arrived with our first three dishes. “but for now,” said john, “we eat.”  after john showed me and claire how to tack, and watching us try it out, we set sail. the san francisco bay was surrounded by city skylines, hills covered with trees, and bridges flanked by tall supports. the day was, to our fortune, clear. the clouds were scant, the wind was steady, and it was warm enough i wore only a thin jacket over a shirt. we sailed past the remnants of the berkeley pier. past that, my already flimsy knowledge of bay area geography was made flimsier by the fact that we were on water. i made out bridges, but i didn’t know which they were. we kept our distance from the land and other boats. and the thrilling parts were thrilling. the boat tilted often, rocking from one angle to another, reaching extremes of thirty degrees. we headed against the wind, tacking back and forth, water splashing into the boat. forward a bit, then tack. forward a bit, then tack. forward a bit, then tack. i held ropes as i steered to one direction, and other times i pulled ropes and wrapped them around winches. we kept close to the wind, narrowly avoiding the no-sail zone. and the relaxing parts were relaxing. we were, after all, on a boat in the san francisco bay, reaping enjoyment from the kind of wealth that came with being a programmer in a startup. we ate snacks, took pictures, and chatted. about sailing and other hobbies, about the cultures we grew up in, about our plans for the future, or lack thereof. after some hours, for it was difficult to tell how many hours exactly, we turned to go back. it was then that i understood why “having the wind in your sails” meant being in a position of good fortune.  for the past few days, i’ve thought on-and-off about that sailing trip.   john asked.   i learned. and yet, we can work toward that direction anyway. not through stubbornly facing the wind head-on, but by letting the wind move us sideways—then turning, tacking, moving in another direction but still indirectly moving forward. and so, instead of stubbornly trying to do work  on days i don’t have the energy to one of the blog posts i read as a prefrosh was rona’s  sellout’s conundrum The shortest distance between two points is reliably a straight line. If your dreams are apparent to you, pursue them. Creating optionality and buying lottery tickets are not way stations on the road to pursuing your dreamy outcomes. They are dangerous diversions that will change you. i used to believe this was true. that if you had set goals in mind, your time was best spent going for those goals directly. i used to admire people who stuck to what they wanted, like the kids who wanted to be doctors then grew up to be doctors. i used to think that you couldn’t be good at something unless you’ve been practicing since birth. but sometimes, pursuing your goals head-on is impossible. sometimes, the wind’s blowing against where you want to go. and even if it was possible, it could hurt you. harden you, sharpen you. you’ll make it, but you’ll end up  cutting everything you touch instead, move forward a bit, then turn. jump from hobby to hobby. pursue wide and varied interests. change your major as often as you change your clothes. keep tacking, as that’s the only way to sail against the wind.

Back in September, I wrote my first blog. I called it  Things I Know to Be True It was meant to be a simple introductory post, and I suppose it was, but I also wanted it to act as an anchor. I told myself that if I ever encountered a stormy sea at MIT, which I often do, I could throw down the anchor. I could revisit what I knew to be true. Looking back on the post, I think its ridiculous. I think it is needlessly sentimental. It reads poorly. It clambers around in naivety, sending any artifacts of reality crashing to the floor. If it was a creature, it would have obnoxiously oversized appendages, and it would leave a greasy trail behind it. I don’t like the blog at all. I take some pride in saying this because it means I am a different person than I was in September. For many MIT students, that change is continuous, like paint gliding across a page. For most MIT bloggers, that change is documented, like dozens of timestamped posts immortalized on the internet. Oh wait. It is literally dozens of timestamped posts immortalized on the internet. Because of this, I have to be accepting of who I once was as much as who I am. I signed up to   do this, and it comes with unique growing pains. I think that’s why I haven’t been writing so much. I’m scared to document anything I won’t like in the future. As a challenge to myself, I’m putting my feelings about   aside, and I’m letting it continue to grow alongside me. I’m rubbing it in further. Each year, I’ll add a few points. Here are some of the things I’ve learned to be true from my freshman year: A few weeks ago, I was searching for 8.02 ASE materials for an MIT admit. I took the class in the Spring and fared decently, especially considering I   physics. When I looked through some of the exams and assignments, I was baffled by the fact that I was ever able to learn the content. It looks like it is written in a different language, which is why it is written on shirts.  But I learned it. I went to class, only because it was attendance mandatory, and I sat through it. A semester later, I knew 8.02. When I got my first UROP in the winter, I didn’t care about funding. I was so excited to take part in one of MIT’s coveted traditions, and so I   accepted an offer to take the UROP for credit. I remember explaining my UROP to an upperclassman during IAP, and he scoffed when I told him about the credit.  I clarified,  . He laughed and told me I take classes for free anyways. After that, I realized that I was working 12 hours a week for virtually nothing. Get funding. The first time I got sick at MIT, I caught what I thought was a slight cold compounded with allergies. A week later, I found myself laying down in MIT Medical doing breathing treatments while the doctor listens to my lungs and winces. I went on antibiotics, twice. I missed two midterms. I lost significant weight. Had I given myself  day to rest,  day with adequate sleep, none of that would’ve happened. Take care of yourself first. These are some things I now know to be true after a year at MIT. I’ll see you a year from now, with a fresh set of mistakes, worries, and experiences to write from.

When I applied to be a blogger last summer, “what happened yesterday?” was one of the prompts I responded to. I wrote about finishing my internship work early and spending the rest of my day wandering around Boston; fairly mundane stuff. But mundane is nice. I often feel like I have to organize my thoughts into some grand realization or wrap up a cool project before I have something worth writing about, but lately I’ve been trying to just enjoy things as they come. I don’t want to
 
contemplate anything too intensely right now. ⁠ 01 not that there's anything wrong with that; i absolutely live for vincent's blogs that overanalyze the heck out of everything. I had actually moved to New York City to stay for the summer about a week prior. Most of my stuff was still at MIT, so the night before “yesterday,” I took a train back to MIT to finish moving my stuff and see some familiar faces.  
Yesterday, ⁠ 02 yesterday here is referring to last last Saturday. you know how reality TV shows are always filmed weeks if not months before they're released? yeahhh  I woke up around noon in my dorm room. I don’t remember the last time I’ve let myself sleep in to my heart’s content in this room. I usually set an alarm even on weekends.  But yesterday, it felt great to just take all the time in the world to get out of bed. I sat on the edge of my bed for a while, admiring the midday sunshine streaming into my room. I was feeling kinda cute, so I put on a flowy white skirt. For most of my life I’ve never liked skirts much, but seeing how cool my friends look in billowing skirts has made me like them more lately.  I met up with Winnie to walk to Haymarket, an outdoor produce market in Boston that’s open every Friday and Saturday until sunset. Also wearing a flowy skirt that day, Winnie has been one of my major fashion inspirations. The Haymarket was easily reachable by
 
T, ⁠ 03 boston's subway system 
the Longfellow Bridge ⁠ 04 the harvard bridge is probably more well known, but the longfellow's much cuter in my humble opinion We then hopped on the T and then a northbound bus to visit this
 
mushroom ⁠ 05 the kind that you'd normally cook, just to be clear 
Somerville ⁠ 06 suburb north of cambridge  that Winnie’s coworker had recommended to her.  “What’s the name of this mushroom store?” “It’s literally called  The Mushroom Store It took quite a bit of effort to get to The Mushroom Store, but I love going to great lengths to visit oddly specific places. The Mushroom Store was small and cozy. Half of the space was dedicated to mushroom t-shirts, tote bags, books, and related paraphernalia; and the other half to mushrooms in their original fungal form and in jams, candies, etc. Winnie wanted to make stir fried noodles with mushrooms, so we picked out small handfuls of beech, yellow oyster, and pink oyster from a deli case full of different varieties. She also bought a frog shirt, as recommended by the same coworker.  Previous Next I liked Somerville. It was calm and quiet, in a peaceful and comforting way. Houses here had large front yards full of flowers in full bloom. Rainbow flags jutted out from every other porch and small business; happy pride! I was planning to meet up on campus with Jason ‘23 later that day, so Winnie and I made our way over to the Porter Square T station to get back. The walk from The Mushroom Shop to the Porter Square T station was a long one, but it felt great to take life at a slower pace.  oops i meant Shop, not Store. Jason had the same reaction that I did to hearing about The Mushroom Shop. To loosely quote Winnie, “they’re probably so confident about being the only mushroom shop around that they can name themselves The Mushroom Shop” He’s way too humble to say so himself, but Jason’s an absolute legend at spinning poi. Dearest reader, I recommend that you search up “MIT spinning arts jason poi” on Youtube to see something utterly incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular… We did a few partner poi moves for last year’s

firejam ⁠ 09 during the school year, Spinning Arts organizes weekly firejams where any fire safety trained member can come and burn! we're still organizing them during the summer, just not as regularly. Previous Next Adjusting to a new routine in a new city full of new people can be exciting, but I was honestly very happy for the familiarity that came with a firejam in the middle of the East Campus courtyard. People who I know and love, manipulating magnificent orbs of fire between the two parallels that I’ve come to call home.  Infinite loop of Jason and I passing around a dragonstaff. Filmed and edited by Winnie. While my main purpose for visiting Boston had been to pack up and move my stuff, I did none of that yesterday. But I still had another two days before I leave for NYC once more. And there’s nothing wrong with slowing down and letting myself take my time.

After a short burst of productivity in January, I proceeded to not write a mere sentence for months on the blogs. This makes the 6-month hiatus my longest dry streak here… oops. I’m making the New York Knicks’ drought look good out here. The lack of writing was complicated… it was not out of not wanting to, but nothing manifested even if I got a few lines in. I barely wrote during the spring, save for my intensive writing class, in which I still struggled to write most of my essays. Regarding classes, you might be wondering, “Waly, how was your semester,” but let us not ask such provocative questions. That we can talk about… later, another time, maybe never. Instead, let me steer the conversation very clear of my academics… to clothes. Lovingly referred to as, “merch.” Over my 1.5 years physically at MIT and my one  splendid  Zoom U semester, I have constantly been on a mission to better myself. By that, I mean bettering my wardrobe with an exorbitant amount of MIT merch. If one were, for some reason, to just take a look into my closet, they would be a little confused why I have so many tangentially MIT-related clothes. Virtually all my T-shirts have slowly morphed into being bonafide merch. I am fairly certain I am still missing some in this blog. This “merch” I speak of does not count the numerous MIT-related stickers, mugs, towels, masks, branded tape measures, squeezable pigs, posters, plushies, and random other stuff that have come into my possession without being bought. An onlooker peeking into my closet might even think I represent the school in some way, work with admissions, or do some stuff in student government… which couldn’t be closer to the truth. As I packed up most of my clothes as the spring semester ended, I decided to be that onlooker in my closet and made a slightly sketchy catalog of the pieces of merch I have gathered over MIT so far.  Before moving forward, I wanted to thank Nisha ‘21 for  blogging about a quilt she made using MIT T-shirts UPOP Shirt The UPOP T-shirt… is one I have an awkward relationship with. This might be because I dropped UPOP in the spring semester. UPOP is a career accelerator for sophomores, and I would say a decent share of our class is a part of it. Think maybe 400 sophomores? I dropped it not because I didn’t like the program; I felt it was cool for the most part, even though I was familiar with a decent share of the content. But I valued sleep more than having a career, and I did not have it in me to wake up for 3 days straight at 9 am for a training/conference weekend. It was our first 3-day weekend of the semester, and I was already getting uppercut by my classes. I needed a break, not a 9-5. I know that some high schoolers might be reading this and saying… 9 am… that’s just disappointing. And if you are thinking that, you aren’t exactly wrong; I would agree with you. I woke up around 5:30 every morning in high school, and I’m fairly certain sophomore high school me would disown sophomore college me for this. But I promise you, 9ams in college just hit different. Fighting a body that refuses to budge from the warm sheets is an everlasting struggle. I still have this t-shirt because it is nice and soft, and though I did not complete the UPOP program, there were helpful elements I took from it.  HOME Shirt Sometime during sophomore spring, the OME (Office of Minority Education) emailed about having shirts they were giving away to students. I never turn down free things, so I got a shirt :D. Not too much more to this story, since I haven’t done too much with the OME, but it is a nice shirt, and the HOME logo is very snazzy. SuperUROP Shirt This shirt also lacks a lengthy backstory. Funny enough, I have never even worn this shirt before and recently donated it. One day, I found myself in the EECS student lounge with a friend, and the lounge was giving away T-shirts that preceded Course 6’s redesign. SuperUROP as a program still exists, so I’m not sure why it was being given away. We each took some since they were… good T-shirts. I just somehow neglected to check if this shirt would even fit me. It was virtually a badly-made crop-top, which I couldn’t rock too well. MIT EECS Shirt Wow, I 100% did not get this shirt from the same box as the last one! This shirt luckily fits me far better than the last one. Considering I was not a Course 6 when I was getting the shirts, not too sure again why I took it, but maybe I was preparing for my sellout era. I wound up switching majors to Course 6 in a  not-so-shocking turn of events Waly Shirt Let me preface this shirt by saying I am not a massive narcissist who walked out one day and bought a shirt with his face on it. This shirt sits in the very depths of my closet, out of the light. Friends have made multiple offers to take it off my hands. Though someone else wearing my face is a little funny at first thought, I am quickly taken back to the horrifying reality of that situation if it were to happen. This shirt was given to me (and the other bloggers) by Admissions, and I’ve worn it on two occasions, both of which I believe were Meet the Bloggers during CPW. Though I greatly appreciate the shirt (it’s pretty soft), I can’t fathom wearing it out in public MIT MakerLodge Shirt This shirt is probably the oldest one I have from physical MIT. After getting on campus in February, I was very excited to get makerspace training, and I signed up for it rather quickly. After going through the needed lessons, students received a toolbox (which has been actually pretty useful) and a shirt from Makerlodge. Though I haven’t gone to makerspaces as much as I would have liked during the semesters, I did laser cut a few sheets of acrylic over this year :) 2024 Orientation Shirt If you didn’t know, I am a 2024 (for now). This means we had a fun thing called virtual orientation, which was an interesting affair. The student engagement was virtually 0, but I liked that they put effort into the opening show. I haven’t worn this shirt too much since freshman year, but it is still nice to lounge around in or something like that. Orientation was not very memorable for me, since Zoom can only be so engaging.  Calsol/American Solar Challenge/Minnesota/GT/MIT SEVT Shirts Lots of T-Shirts all grouped here. Lots of these T-shirts don’t say MIT, but they are quite related. Last summer, MIT’s Solar Electric Vehicle Team raced our car, Nimbus, across Missouri (barely), Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. At the final pitstop in Las Vegas (not the one you are thinking of), lots of teams exchanged merchandise, sort of as a souvenir. I exchanged shirts with certain teams because I really liked their designs, especially that of Minnesota’s shirt. I’m not as certain where the ASC shirt actually came from. It might have been what every participant on a team received at the very start. I could talk a lot about the race last year, but  I kinda already have… Previous Next Jack Florey Shirt Around CPW, a Jack Florey shirt appeared in my room. I had no recollectiion of how this black and white shirt had appeared there. A few dollars had also mysteriously disappeared from my possession around the same time. After pondering on it for a while, I realized – Jane Street/Virtu/HRT Shirts During the school year, there is this dandy thing called the career fair. From the upperclassmen, I have heard legendary tales of going to booths, receiving so much merch, and talking to many, many people. As a 2024, I have yet to see a career fair happen in person, and I have unjustly been deprived of free merchandise, ahem career opportunities, from varying companies. Though our past 2 career fairs have both been virtual, some companies still offered a form to have merchandise mailed to you, which I filled out. I wasn’t sure if anything would come in the mail, but sure enough, some things trickled in after a few weeks. These t-shirts are probably some of the ones I would rate the most comfortable and wearable, even though I have no clue how to handle money as well as these companies do Previous Next Associate Advising Shirt Ah, another complicated relationship shirt. If a ranking were to happen, I would, without a doubt, be a top 10 associate adviser. From the bottom. I genuinely was not a good Associate Adviser, and that is one of the (many o__o) things that I was disappointed with myself regarding this year. I wish I was more present as an AA, not just around registration times, and planned a decent get-together of some sort. The thought was there, but the actions did not materialize well. The hells of sophomore year just… got hands, but I still could have collectively done much better than I did. The professor I associate advised with is one of the nicest people I would say I’ve met at MIT, and I talked to her on a few occasions regarding majors and struggling in classes. I probably can’t verbalize how helpful those talks were. At MIT, I sometimes feel I’ve been
 
hurting relationships ⁠ 01 unintentionally, but the damage is still there regardless Sigh . Mild digression aside, comfortable shirt, not as comfortable reminders.  FLI Shirt At some point at the end of last summer, I volunteered for an FLI (first-gen low income) first-year dinner as a part of being an Associate Adviser. I was the only non-freshman there somehow, so that was mildly awkward, but it was alright overall. I got this shirt from that event, and it’s pretty nice. Got some nice graphic design I must say. During sophomore year, I wanted to go to some other FLI student events, but it just never happened. Most of them overlapped with other plans I was having socially or regarding extracurriculars. The other times, I didn’t want to go to an event I didn’t really know anyone at. Raging introvert energy. For someone who writes stuff random folk on the internet read, one might expect me to be a whole lot better at random social situations. But I am often a quiet potato. DME Shirt My
 
FPOP! ⁠ 02 fpops are programs first years can do to explore campus and learn about a major/interest area Masstech Shirt This shirt was pretty cheap, but also not free, so it’s kind of a cheat. As one could guess, this is without a doubt, a very, very official MIT shirt that is made by students. It is certainly not modeled after the name of a familiar tech school on the other side of the country. A school that may also have a beaver as a mascot. A tech school with a cannon we may or may not have picked up in a heist. Masstech I feel has a nice ring to it, and I could like it if we were called this instead. 2 syllables are so much easier to say than 3.  World Bibim Week Shirt/Jacket Over this past IAP (January Term), I taught for MISTI-Korea’s GTL program with my team, and it was a great experience. One that I should probably blog about at some point in time. We taught hands-on STEM workshops in two cities, Seongnam and Jeonju, and I received these in the latter. After teaching for the week, we were gifted a goodie bag with some presents from program administrators and the city government, which was so sweet and really heart-warming. I don’t think I could sum up this experience in a paragraph, so I guess I will be left with no choice but to unleash words onto a google doc shortly. WMBR Shirt Yet another complicated relationship. Actually, it is not that complicated, just slightly awkward. During freshman fall, I got a dormspammed email about WMBR and thought it was pretty cool that we had a radio station. As an overambitious froshling, I signed up to learn more and got a t-shirt. I winded up not joining WMBR, but of course, since I had the T-shirt, I still wore it. One day, as I was getting lunch from the Macgregor Covid-era Dining Hall, someone excitedly saw my shirt and began talking to me about WMBR. I had to give the conversation an untimely demise by saying I actually wasn’t a part of the group. I believe I have not worn the shirt out since. MOSTEC Shirt I got this shirt during the fall of sophomore year! I was in
 
MOSTEC ⁠ 03 MOSTEC is an MIT OEOP six month STEM enrichment program for hs juniors, particularly from underrepresented backgrounds. I would highly recommend applying to it (and/or MITES) if you are a high school junior Summer HSSP Shirt Last summer, on a few Saturdays, with some friends (a black belt and a yellow belt), I taught a virtual Taekwondo class. It was mainly geared at late middle school/early high school students and took place over 6 weeks. We taught 2 weeks a piece and covered punches, kicks, stances, and went through the white belt form. It was rather casual and for the most part, a fine time. We did struggle with getting people to turn on their camera, though considering how much I don’t turn it on, it would be hypocritical of me to complain about that. The panda on the HSSP shirt was the animal mascot for summer HSSP, and I find this shirt to be one of the cutest I have. ESG Shirt bonus beanie! I think anyone who has had the fortune (or misfortune) of asking me about ESG has heard that I really love ESG. It single-handedly made my freshman year much better, without a doubt. Looking back, the structure that ESG had, especially attendance-wise, was really helpful for me. For someone who hates structure, I desperately need it. I’m not too sure how exactly I got this shirt, but it might have been from volunteering for CPW or for just being a frosh in ESG. There are some lizards on the shirt since it is ESG’s mascot! We are, indeed, just lizard people at MIT Blog or Die Shirt Just around the same time that we got the cursed shirts with our names and likeliness on them as bloggers, we also received shirts that were
 
designed for us :D. ⁠ 04 thanks Jeremy :) EC Rush Shirt No, I was not an MIT student in 2017. Instead, I was having the time of my life as a sleep-deprived high school student. But when REX, a time for first-years to explore dorms, was happening, many shirts from old year’s hall rushes were being sold for some low number like 2 or 3 dollars. The cat one was exceptionally cute, and though it is a tad large on me, I love to wear it very often. I don’t have much else that is Black and Blue, which is a feature that I liked as well. Entrepreneurship Shirt One day, I learned that an event near Sloan was going to be handing out free Chipotle. Like any reasonably sane college student, I would never pass up on free food, so I headed over to the event after I held office hours for a class I TAed. Of course, the Chipotle miraculously ran out in lightning speed, and all hope was lost. They had some stickers and other merch like this shirt at the event, so I took some things as a consolation prize. The shirt is really nice quality, so I wear it sometimes, but less than many others on this list. I (heart) MIT/Orientation Leader Shirts At the end of last summer, I was an Orientation Leader for the Class of 2025, which involved mainly giving advice, talking about key topics (academics, clubs, drug use, the usual), and helping around with anything else. For the most part, I enjoyed being an OL. It was a bit hot some of those days, and there were times attendance was dwindling, but since I had no other commitments at the time, I was able to be pretty focused on being an OL. I would say I did an alright job overall, with no major regrets or that sort of thing. Well, I am still extremely salty that the in the competition of the orientation teams, Black team lost to the Brown team, but that is all. 6.034 Shirt During my Sophomore fall, I took an Artificial Intelligence class, mainly for the sake of it being cool and tangentially aligned to my interests. I’ve heard some people say that “it is the easiest class in course 6,” which must mean I am either very dumb or disagree with that sentiment. I liked the class a lot, though I found some parts, particularly coding-wise, to be a bit challenging at times. It was my second CS class after 6.0001/18.0002, which are introductory coding classes, so maybe that was a compounding factor. At the end of the fall semester, 034 had a website where they sold these shirts pretty cheap, so I got one to always be able to recall my inability to understand alpha-beta pruning DynaMIT Shirt Last summer, for a week I also was a mentor for DynaMIT, which is a middle school STEM outreach program for kids in the Boston area. During the program, we taught some basics in Math, Astronomy, Biology, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemistry. 4 students were paired with 2 mentors to create a “family” for the week. I really loved working with DynaMIT, and it really reminded me of some of the STEM programs I got to do when I was a younger soul. Lots of these programs made me find things in
 
science, technology, and engineering ⁠ 05 notice I did not include math here Ringcomm Shirt The long-awaited  ring premiere NEET Shirt Ah, another shirt that came from me attending a free food event. Early in sophomore fall, NEET, which holds many tracks to explore specific engineering interests, had an event to talk about their new climate and sustainability track. I found the track pretty interesting, but as someone who likes HASS classes a lot, the track would have been rather limiting. Mainly academically due to the extra classes I would need to take. The shirt is a bit on the smaller side, so I actually don’t wear it too much. It is just lying around MIT 2024 Hoodie This hoodie was designed by a member of our class and was voted the top design choice by 2024s. It again is another cheat as it was not free, but in the general scheme of talking about merch, I wanted to talk about it a little bit. As Class Council, we held a design competition, where students submitted their design ideas, and navigating through the many submissions was really fun. The hoodie is a nice warm one, slightly large, but I like baggier clothes if anything, so it works out pretty fine. Bonus: Non-shirts I was far too lazy to collect pictures of everything in this category, but here are a few… Army ROTC Backpack I am not in ROTC. In fact, I am horrible at push-ups. I would never make it in the army for that reason alone. One day, I was going to Stata Loading Dock, where valuable garbage is often left, and found a bunch of ROTC stuff left to be thrown out. Some of it was pretty cool, so I got a backpack. I used it to hold my Taekwondo uniform and belt for when I would actually show up to practice, and it has served me very well.  Toy Lab Hat 2.00B! Probably my favorite class at MIT, this was a toy product design class I took during freshman spring. Since this was a
 
COVID semester, ⁠ 06 though one could say every semester so far has been a covid semester MIT Beanie This beanie is one I got from moving in! We got a bag of goodies before we had to quarantine for a week in freshman year as we arrived on campus, and this hat was there. It works really nicely when I want to use headphones to listen to music, so that has been cool MechE Beanie Considering I switched from Course 2… I hope they do not request this beanie back. During the winter, the office for undergraduates was offering beanies to all current students, so one day I went and claimed mine. I really like beanies, even though they are kind of horrible for my hair, and this one is no exception Onto the next semesters of merch we go!

“Why did you come back?” 
“Well, I’m—I’m a queer Asian…person, so…” 
“You felt seen.” 
“Yeah.” When I was growing up, I was always the odd one out.  Growing up in South Dakota I spent a good amount of time feeling sorry for myself in middle school. By high school, I had grown used to being treated differently, and I no longer hated it as much, because, to be frank— I had developed a successful coping mechanism. I would simply  than the people around me, and it would prove to them that I was worth something. If it wasn’t enough for them, at least I could say to myself, internally: “they just don’t like you because you’re different.” The truth is that, for the most part, this strategy worked. I was reasonably good at everything I did, and great at a few particular ones, at least within my state. I could
 
play in the all-state orchestra, ⁠ 01 To be extremely clear, '28th best high school violinist in South Dakota' is not a high honor, but it is one which I received. All that said, I knew that I was a big fish in a small pond. I’d been to national-level events; I knew that there were people miles and miles ahead of me. This didn’t faze me. The point was specifically to out-compete the people near me, so that they would have to accept me. It wasn’t easy, but I did it. Something smells fishy. I never harbored any suspicions that I might not be straight until the summer after my sophomore year of high school. Of course, looking back on it, there were signs: I still remember feeling an absurd amount of joy and relief after the  Obergefell decision in 2015. At the time I felt the joy came from the righting of social wrongs, not any effect the decision might have on my personal life. By the summer of 2017, however, the situation was obvious. I was bi, or, at the very least, out of the three options in my mental framework at the time—gay, straight, and bi—I was closest to the last option. This realization was kind of sudden, and to be honest, I don’t really remember what caused it. I only remember that before the summer of 2017, I identified as straight, and afterwards, I identified as bi, and nothing specific had driven this shift in identification. To be honest, I felt kind of  fucked In spite of this—and partially because I  so tired of hiding all the interesting things about me—over the last two years of high school, I ended up coming out to a lot of my friends, one friend at a time, each one a calculated risk. Funnily enough, a lot of my friends also came out to me. By the time I graduated high school, about half of my friend group was out as queer. That was neat, at least. It would have been nice to have known earlier, but that was the environment we lived in. We moved on with our lives. I arrived at MIT freshman fall and finally got to go through my baby gay phase. I dyed the front part of my hair, got myself some bi pride buttons,
 
and  broke the November Rule ⁠ 02 obligatory comment: do not break the November Rule. it only ends badly for you, and all the upperclassmen will just say 'we told you so.' Of course, I didn’t feel entirely safe yet. After spending seventeen years growing up in a kind of fear you didn’t even notice, it’s hard to let things go. I still knew that queerness invited violence, and even holding hands or leaning on each other in public felt dangerous. I very vividly remember holding hands with my boyfriend, sitting on a bench in the elevator lobby in Lobby 7 on a Friday evening, seeing one of the graduate students in my lab exit the elevator, and feeling the adrenaline kick through my veins.  Coming into MIT, I had been told over and over: “you will need to find something to define yourself other than your intelligence.” This was a worry, but it was also a relief. I was tired of being unique, of being the one Asian person in the room, of being the one queer person in the room. Being surrounded by other queer Asian MIT students made me seem utterly unremarkable, and that was delicious. It was refreshing to just be normal. On the other hand— I also remember going to a Rainbow Lounge event during my freshman year, and feeling utterly disconnected from all the people there. I mean, how do you even start a conversation? “Hi, I’m Alan, and I’m attracted to people of all genders, and that’s the reason I’m talking to you today!” It just didn’t seem right. I mean, many of us had shared experiences growing up, but at MIT? Queerness was no longer a defining characteristic of our lives, and that was liberating, but it meant that I felt no strong sense of connection to the other people in the room. In David Foster Wallace’s “ This Is Water There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?” Being at the Rainbow Lounge event felt like I was going to an event “in the water,” as if I had not been in the water the whole time. It would be like collecting a group of people who were all 5′ 11″ to have a focus group about their particular height, or collecting  a large set of people named Josh to fight for the right to the name. 
not particularly valuable in practice. ⁠ 03 I say this with deep apologies to the Josh fight. Because of this sense of that queerness was no longer defining on campus, I found myself deeply frustrated when people described dorms like EC and Random as “queer spaces,” because I had happily found my community in Next House, and I was queer. MIT was queer enough.  a community isn’t loudly queer . Although part of me did yearn for a little more “showy” queerness in Next, with pride flags and hair dye and whatnot, I knew I felt perfectly safe in Next, and I felt very sad about potential Nexties being pushed away from Next simply because these other dorms were “more queer.” Every time I saw a prefrosh ask about queer dorms on campus, either online or during CPW, I wanted to say: “You’ll be okay. You’ll be okay wherever you chose to live.” clownfish. A few weeks ago, on a random day during senior week, Shuli and I wandered down to Quincy Market, a tourist attraction with notoriously high prices, for the sake of celebrating the end of the school year. As we walked around, we noticed a surprisingly high number of people with pride flags. We discussed what the source of this “unresolved gay situation” might be while we ate lunch, until we finally decided to ask someone about it: “We’ve noticed a lot of pride flags around, is there some kind of event or something?” 
“Yeah, it’s Pride.” It turned out Boston Youth Pride was happening just a few blocks down, and we went and wandered into a festival of queer joy. It was a nice reminder that queer people exist and are happy outside the MIT bubble, too. Over the past three years, I’ve learned a lot about queerness from the people around me. I’ve learned what it means to be pan, or ace, or aro, and I’ve met lots of trans and non-binary people—identities which weren’t as present where I was growing up. As I’ve learned more, I’ve continually evaluated my own identity, and I’ve always been worried that I wouldn’t be able to keep that identity alive in the “real world.” Wandering into Pride gave me hope, if just for a second, that it would be. When I eventually returned home, I found myself reconsidering my thoughts on queerness at MIT. If I felt so much joy in seeing these folks celebrate queerness, wouldn’t being more openly and loudly queer bring joy to other people as well? I’ve come to the conclusion that there is no “right way” to resolve this cognitive dissonance. Pride flags and hair dye can be discussion starters, and being openly and loudly queer can help show others that they, too, are free to be themselves around you and around others. Fighting for the right to be yourself can help show others coming after you that there is hope. The “showy” queerness can be important to building a community that  truly welcoming. The truth is, however, that being an example sucks sometimes. Having conversations where you are explaining your identity can be exhausting. The whole point of coming out is to try and be the person you truly are, and sometimes that person just isn’t loud or open, or “showy.” Each person and each community must strike their own balance. The question for me then becomes, “have I struck the right balance for myself?” To be honest, I’m still not sure. This year, a group of Nexties started a new Next House student group called Next Queer. One of their initiatives was to buy pride flags for anybody in the house who wanted them. One of the options for delivery was to have them taped up outside your door, once they arrived. I got a rainbow flag, a bi flag, and a non-binary flag. I let the flags hang outside my door for the rest of the semester. This summer, I’ve been trying to be  a little more spontaneous “Why did you come back?” 
“Well, I’m—I’m a queer Asian…person, so…” 
“You felt seen.” 
“Yeah.” Just a few months ago, I would never have said that in public to someone I was just meeting. I would have used the word “guy” instead of “person” and winced internally. This summer, when I introduced myself to my intern cohort, I got to say, for the first time: “Hi! I’m Alan. I use they/them pronouns.” In a pre-show discussion
 
at a different musical, ⁠ 04 post about all these musicals coming at a later date As the panel wrapped up, the moderator asked the question, “what gives you hope?” One by one, each of them gave the same answer: the bravery of queer youth to simply be their authentic selves in a world that chooses to resist them. So, here we are. Being brave. It has taken so much time and so many conversations with so many people to get me here, but I am here now, and that is enough. Happy Pride.

in the last two weeks, i’ve been invited to two parties in the bay area. the first one was an invitation from a co-intern, who sent it in a group text with all the other company interns in the bay. it was a link to a website called partiful: think facebook events for parties. the title of the event was “sf party” and the description of the event said it was for “smart, hard-working, ambitious people in tech.” now, my experience with parties were mostly parties in east campus and small gatherings with friends. i had a particular idea of what parties could look like, and the one i attended was, somehow, yet another new experience. on the surface, it seemed similar: vague party music (but no chart songs), alcohol, pizza, and people standing around talking to each other. no dance floor, sure. more variance in age, with what i’m pretty sure were prefrosh and people several years in college. and instead of being held in a dormitory, it was held at an office. for a startup, of course, cofounded by one of the hosts. but these were only surface differences; the real difference was what people talked about. the conversations i had in this “sf party” began with names and a handshake. where are you from? where do you go to school? and the dreaded   or if it’s   kind of person, it’s   did you mean to ask about my woodworking skills? i’m good at building  lego worms when two founders talked to each other about their startup, i wasn’t sure if they were talking to each other or past each other. i wasn’t sure whether that conviction people had about their work was rooted in a genuine belief that they’re working on someting that’ll change the world, or whether it was a farce. i wasn’t sure if people were enjoying this. i kid you not, the stereotypes were real, down to the  mentions of peter thiel last sunday i went to another party, this one was advertised as an “mit bay area meetup”. it was a pool party near san mateo. and the beats were similar: music, drinks, food, talking. it was at a huge mansion in the late afternoon, instead of a startup office after hours. and when i say huge, i mean  . two kitchens, a pool, like five living rooms, a basement, a  , gilded toilets and dozens of locked rooms. i’d guess around a hundred people came and went through the party, but the house was so big there easily could’ve been six simultaneous parties without anyone bumping into each other. one of the things i talked about with people was whether they’d want to live in this house, and i got a lot of nos. a house like this felt much too big, even if it was a group living space. i felt the same, really. a friend talked about sf’s “deluded sense of glamor”. that these people might’ve, on paper, lived together to do work and inspire each other and stay in touch. but now it’s people with too much vc money and throwing parties for the sake of throwing parties. they compared it to the rise of tiktok’s  content houses even if the house was huge, there was only so much room to explore and talk about before the conversation had to turn to other topics. and context made conversations smoother, in the way that you could mention dormitories and class numbers and people would understand. the difference in the kinds of conversations was deeper than that, though. i heard people complain about housing prices and public transport and relationships and other people. i heard people talk about the weather and fun things they’ve planned for this summer and good places to eat out. not that i didn’t hear people talk about work, not that   didn’t talk to people about work. everyone was a software engineer, unsurprisingly. and i asked people what they did, what their company did. i listened to the corporate rumor mill, and i enjoyed it. i also heard about what people were learning, or what people felt about their work. and the range of emotions people felt about their work was varied. some liked it, some didn’t. some felt good about what their work was doing, others felt disconnected. i suppose if you were a cofounder of a startup, then you   to be psyched about what you’re doing. but it was nice to talk to people who weren’t, if that makes sense? and i don’t want to decry the partygoers from the first party as clout-chasing techbros. many of the people i talked to were young, and had the time lined up for them to mature. and i’m certain that there were people there who were thoughtful about their work, and i’m sure that the sample i saw in both parties were biased in ridiculous ways. the fact was, though, i enjoyed the second party more than the first one, and i feel that’d be the case even without the mit context. maybe i’m getting old. or maybe people are catching ambition while they’re too young?

Monday, June 13th . 9:33 pm, in the back of Öz Konya Kebab: brightly lit, with LED lights on the ceiling that ease through the rainbow. I am not raging against the machine, exactly, staying up late to write this; the machine is kind to me, has free seltzer and coffee in the break room all day. There is oatmilk in the fridge, and a basket of granola bars upstairs. In some ways this is exactly what I predicted a startup would be; in other ways, it’s better.  I’ve been just over a week in this city. Some notes from the road… some ducks I would encounter June 3rd. Tucson, Arizona, my room with blue walls and faded art from past comic-cons. The last time I packed this backpack it was with eight books, all fantasy; two pairs of jeans; just enough socks, shirts, and underwear to get by. Now it’s half-full with the work-appropriate clothes I couldn’t fit in my two suitcases. I’m going to be in Europe for the same amount of time. Less. I wonder, when did I learn this luxury? Chances are that I’m not going to come home with half a novel written, this time. June 4th,  . ⁠ 01 actually Reykjavik, after Seattle and before Copenhagen itself. I ate actual Icelandic skyr! It tasted kinda like yogurt. I finished  Pleasure Activism  somewhere over the sea. Adrienne maree brown’s language of self-love fills me with warmth. I mixed up the time zone change and resigned myself to ten more hours of flight, when in fact there were only three. A relief. June 5th, Copenhagen 6pm They lost my bags in Amsterdam. The man at baggage claim with an accent like my late uncle’s told me they’d send the bags to my place tomorrow. My Molchat Doma shirt had been worn for over twenty hours. 7pm The sun never sets here. I tried to puzzle out the Danish bus system on six hours of sleep in the last seventy-some, gave up, walked forty minutes through the sun to my hostel. It was good sun, albeit weak compared to where I’m from. The shops and houses were old, adjoined, and quintessentially European. The Indian and Middle Eastern restaurants I passed by smelled amazing. 10 pm, at the bar of my hostel I’m sharing poetry over Zoom with some friends from MIT. Their words are rich and good. 12 am I am again eighteen, lying awake in a hostel bed while around me men shuffle and snore. Reviews rave about the cool concept of this place — a lot of tents in a big room, a bed three times the price it would be in Spain — but tents are less soundproof than walls. You can hear dozens of people snore, cough, sneeze. At 6 am alarms start going off, and do not cease. June 6th People have holidays in Denmark in which the stores are not reduced to 10 am to 7 pm, but are simply closed. They are open 10-7 on regular days. There is no equivalent to the Target or Walmart open at any hour, if you’re willing to drive far enough. This day was such a holiday. Work started at 8 the next morning. I had only my Molchat Doma shirt, which at this point had been worn for over thirty hours.  I wandered the streets until I found a shop that was blissfully open. The selection was targeted toward women slightly more conservative than me, but the prices were good, and the owner let me pay in US dollars when I didn’t have Danish krone. I bought the sort of loose pants I wore all the time in high school, and a dress with a cut similar to one I wore on my second-ever date, back when I was fourteen.  A friend I’d wandered MIT with showed me around Copenhagen, from the Little Mermaid statue to the docks to Reffen, a market with food stalls from all corners of the globe. There was real Mexican food, the stall painted like fast food places back home. I hadn’t expected to taste that for months. the entrance to Reffen June 7th, Seaborg ApS I begin work! I’ve worked odd jobs all over, but this is my first in the tech industry. I walk from the hostel, deep shadows under my eyes. I’m wearing the flowy pants that would have suited me perfectly when I was fifteen or sixteen.  I have thoughts about the highs and pitfalls of working at a startup, and on the many forms of engineering and how I take to this one, which involves a lot of modelling and frowning at equations or articles on the three monitors of my company set-up. Those thoughts are for another blog. Suffice to say that my company is warm and friendly, and there is a lot of free food. My luggage hasn’t come — it’s been three days, I’m running out of fresh clothes — so after work I get on the phone, bounce between different agents and long holds for a couple hours. No one can find my luggage, though they assure me it’s probably not gone for good. When I finally put the phone down, all the shops are closed except for Fotex, which is the Danish equivalent of Walmart. Like at Walmart, the selection is fairly random, so I buy some pants that are too big and a bra that is too small, thinking it will be very cheap when it is in fact only mid-range cheap.  I get to my room. I’m allergic to something in the bed. June 8 At work I feel like I am in middle school, wearing clothes that only sort of fit and definitely don’t flatter.  All day I am sniffly, and when I get back to my room I cannot stop sneezing. I lived in a space I was allergic to once before, and thought that I could take it; I could, but it was hard, and I swore at the end that I wouldn’t sign up for anything similar again. I send a strongly worded email to the landlord. I splash a lot of water on my face, contemplate the hardwood floor, and crawl into the allergen-filled bed. I feel like I am caving inward. Tumbling backward. Like all the awkwardnesses of years past are coming out at once. I took strength from those times, inspiration — I wrote my first novel wearing too-big sweatpant shorts — but I can’t access any of that now. I sit down and try to write about the feeling, but I am exhausted, and all my words are bad. June 9th The landlord had my bed cleaned with chemical spray, which kinda sort of did not actually work, I am still actively suffering when I get home. Working on this.  But my luggage came back!!! The housing RA, an exchange student who I’d reached out to a few days back, was coming in just as the delivery folks came with my suitcases. Lucky thing, that, because my dormitory has no intercom or package drop-off point. He called me to come down. I thanked him profusely. I hauled my stuff to my room, giddy and, at this point, exceptionally exhausted. I took out one of several mint boxes filled with earrings and opened it, then pawed through the earrings, wondering which ones to wear the next day. But, I realized happily, I didn’t have to choose. I will wear all of them. I have many days. I hopped over to a bar and started writing. This bar allows smoking inside. It doesn’t smell like nicotine, exactly; not like ashtrays, just like smoke. The lights are low and golden, the decor kitschy and antique. Fat candles burning low, streaks on the mirror, actual antler horns on the wall…  found some baby ducks, too June 10th, Friday night After the luggage fiasco was concluded, things took a distinct and definite upswing. My company put on a seminar event about the intersection of design and science, with talks by many engineers in my field. One of them drafted the entirety of his presentation on microsoft paint. My favorite presentation was by a graphic designer from India who talked about order and chaos in the western mindset, influenced by colonization, and the value of embracing chaos and complexity. After that, several coworkers and I went to see a band out on the grass before a bar. They played mostly American rock songs from the ‘70’s. The sun doesn’t set until 10 pm here, and I lounged on a blanket someone had brought, drinking in the music and the people around me. I met a woman from New Mexico — her face lit up when she heard my accent, not just American but Southwestern. I probably did the same, surprised to find familiarity in a place so far away. She told me about her work as a nurse, and how she’s building a house on a mountain in New Mexico. She was flying back there in a few days. the next days I went back to Reffen market. I wandered the streets with a new friend. And then I finally went running. My running shoes had been lost in my luggage all week. I put on a podcast about Robin Hood, one of the endless re-tellings. I thought I knew all the stories by now — I made a concerted effort some years ago to see every remake, though I got through just a small fraction — but
 
this tale ⁠ 02 Episode 273 of Myths and Legends, if you’re interested. As I ran, the path changed underfoot from a city sidewalk to asphalt cutting through a manicured park. Then it morphed into a bike path that ran over a busy street, and then, unexpectedly, turned to a shady forest path. I was seventeen, in western Massachusetts, my first time travelling alone, running through the woods on the outskirts of a camp about Jewish books. I was eighteen, running in Portland, marvelling at all the trees. Miles from anyone, some part of me thought to be afraid; but I pushed that away. The first longing I ever felt was for overgrown trees like these. I have learned since then to idolize the desert. But there is a certain draw to the shade beneath the trees. This, I thought, is where Robin Hood lived. Previous Next Monday, June 13th.  11:11 pm. Öz Konya Kebab is emptier, though not by much.  Despite this litany of grievances, I am grateful to be here. I’m grateful for my RA and the folks in the airline who did what they could to get my luggage back, and the co-workers who invite me to events even though I’ll be gone in a handful of months. And for the friend who, when I complained about everything and then said sorry for complaining, texted back, “never apologize!!”  I am twenty-one. I am contemplating my next tattoo and the last poem I wrote. I’m scouring the world around me for the seeds of stories. Tomorrow I’ll be jumping between nuclear physics videos and my thermodynamics lecture notes, and trading metal band recs with the coworker across from me. I’ll swallow these streets and this city. When this summer ends I will leave many stones uncovered. But some few of them will be mine.

I did not graduate on time. At first, I thought, I’m not one of those people. I was a good student. I defined myself by that quality more than I ever admitted. But I did, undeniably, fail to graduate on time.  It felt like a tragedy, then a failure.  Here’s a bit about me. I started senior year with two majors, a minor, and a 4.8 GPA and a habit of dropping all classes where it was clear I would get a B or lower. How did I not graduate?  Freshman spring was the first period of crisis. I had earned less than two full classes worth of credit. I did not blog about it. Well, I started to, but every post inevitably ended with a positive conclusion, where, for the first time, there wasn’t one. Was it a transformative experience? Yes. Did I grow up? Yes. But it was too quick. I wasn’t equipped to deal with that many support services. I knew it was best to go on academic leave because I wasn’t doing any work, I  couldn’t  do any work. I stayed because whatever options I had for leave felt worse.  And despite everything going on that semester, I  had  to be a good student. I negotiated extensions way past reasonable deadlines. Along with my S^3 Dean and other support staff, I got 1.75 As, an OX, and a LateDrop. Ask me about MIT policies. I learned them all. It was easier than getting a B, or worse, failing.  I dropped many more classes since then, taken advantage of even more grading policies. I also went through intensive therapy. I changed almost everything about my life at MIT, including my major, but excluding my living group. I started multiple drafts about not dealing well with MIT, about almost transferring, about depression, anxiety, PTSD. But they were never good enough, always more academically appropriate than heartfelt, like other bloggers’ posts. That’s not the Imposter Syndrome talking here—I couldn’t  not  be the neutral, helpful blogger. And I couldn’t fit in the other me, the one who had trouble getting both in and out of bed, and being challenged not as much by psets as by the prospect of a shower. Don’t get me wrong. I stand by everything I’ve written publicly. I loved and will continue to love my community and my extracurriculars and UROPs. I found priceless connections that I believe could happen nowhere but MIT.  I’m digressing onto a silver lining here again, but it’s essential to note. I am incredibly fortunate to have found  my  spot at MIT. I’m incredibly fortunate to have  gotten a spot  at MIT. But that gratitude doesn’t require avoiding addressing how the Institute pushes a culture of stress and intensity onto its fortunate members. Not one of the multitude of often amazing resources can fix that. I could get all the extensions and that still wouldn’t get me out of bed in the morning or stop me from engaging in the popular “who’s more hosed” game. And then senior year came. I burned myself out pretty soon with everything involved in the job search, starting from so much Google Calendar-ing. The future seemed like a dark void. Like many of my peers, I had lost track of my passions somewhere along the way. Well, let me clarify that: people here  are  passionate, and I can still  love  what I do, but MIT often destroys the spark of excitement that got us through high school to here. We become “jaded” is the official term.  In the fall of senior year, I got my first D in a mostly-freshman GIR. I just couldn’t get out of bed and my attendance suffered, and I had a hard time concentrating on studying what I’d missed. I passed the first two exams by a narrow margin, but when finals week and all the stress associated with it came, my concentration tanked and I felt  fortunate  to get a D. In fact, I hadn’t been that happy about a grade since my first A freshman year. That D grade felt exhilarating—I wouldn’t have to retake the GIR! D’s get degrees! Feeling refreshed at the start of the spring semester, I thought again that I could do it all—the classes, the job, the extracurriculars, the living group activities, the friends (the latter always the priority). But anxiety hit hard, especially now that I was so close to leaving but no closer to whatever happened after. I would start 10+ page essays the night before their afternoon due date (that is, if I was capable of starting them at all). But worst of all was my attendance. The one class I  had to  pass to graduate, the final elective for my major, was at 9:30am, and I  couldn’t  get out of bed on time. I wasn’t super worried about the lack of attendance—after all, the final paper was due 80% of the grade. But my professor didn’t think so, and in the middle of the  last week ,  finals  week, she emailed me saying I was getting an F. She said she was “very disappointed” in me. I couldn’t disagree. When everyone started celebrating graduation, I was just coming to terms with not having one. I had gone from two majors to none in one semester.  So what next? Well, from here on the post  does  have a happy ending. I couldn’t write it until I had one because it was too painful to still be a  non -graduate, to not know if I  could  graduate.  I registered for an elective at the Harvard Summer School. I took out my first personal loan in order to do that, almost doubling my student debt, but it was so worth it—I was solving the problem all on my own. And, ironically, I was graduating out of  Harvard , once a place I had dreamt to attend, that is, until I fell in love with Nerd Paradise.  The Harvard elective was a most wonderful course, definitely in my top 5 undergrad classes. It changed my view of the world, as a great class should. With the pressure of on-time graduation gone, I was completing assignments on time and in record time. I was working full-time and taking a semester-long course in half the time, but I was doing it all on my own, removed from the context of an educational institution, and I loved it.  I’ve also come to terms with  not  graduating on time. I graduated from MIT in September 2018 and I am still  proud . I am also still part of the Class of 2018, but either way, the date does not define me or my quality as a student. In fact, my quality as a student should not define me at all. What matters is all the wonderful experiences with people and research I had while at MIT. What matters is that I graduated  eventually , and that’s still a big deal. It’s a cause for celebration, and I’m celebrating with this post.  Over the weekend, I graduated with honors with a master of science degree in Science, Health, and Environment journalism from Medill School at Northwestern University. I have a job as a content update editor with  Health.com , one of the biggest online health magazines, and a writing internship at one of the 33 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers funded by the U.S. National Institute on Aging. I’ve published a story in  Discover Magazine , among other venues. And I live with my husband, the love of my life, in Chicago. He was instrumental in helping me find and get through Harvard Summer School, and Medill, and so much more.  In all my grad school applications, I explained why I had an F on my transcript. In fact, when one school asked in their main essay to describe a “moment of truth,” I focused entirely on the time I had to find a way out of that F. And the admissions officers and faculty understood: Mental health is important. MIT is hard, and it’s ok to struggle. Everyone does, at some point. And it’s ok to take time off, or take extra time—the timeline does not define you or your competence as a human being. And you’re not alone in deviating from it.  I did not graduate on time. I am  not  a failure. When I finished the Harvard class, I asked Stu Schmill to stage a mini-graduation with me. Here he is shaking my hand while I hold up an MIT diploma. Graduating from Medill

Starting anything is hard. In fact, starting is often the hardest part, which is a lesson I feel like I am always learning. I haven’t been blogging very much recently, and, if we’re being honest, I’ve felt pretty guilty about it. I think I wrote a grand total of two blogs this past semester, maybe three, which for me is probably an all-time low. Of course, there were other factors, namely February and March unexpectedly turning into a pretty turbulent time, then April and May bringing the usual ramp-up of the firehose. But still. Back when I

And because I was finding it difficult to start up again, here’s a list of everything else I’ve recently started doing (or, really, started again). will be the semester I get back into it for real, and for a long time. And then every semester I inevitably find that there are only so many hours in a day, and physical exercise just isn’t a priority for me right now. This is true, but it is also hard to accept. I wish I did make time for exercise, but there also isn’t anything I’m willing to sacrifice. Something has to change, fundamentally, and I’m still trying to decide what it is and if I want it to change at all. At the very least, though, I have time this summer, so I will run. With any luck, I’ll stick to it for long enough to run a half-marathon in late summer/early fall.  by Donna Tartt, which I really enjoyed, and to start

 I think the trend of this post is that I’m pretty bad at following through on habits in the long term. I like to blame this on MIT, the hectic nature of structuring my life around 12-week semesters and 10-week summer internships. The truth is, some of it is just me. Maybe I’m just not best at following through on things, and that’s fine, as long as I remain aware of that tendency. All I can do is set goals and try my best.

I chose to stay on-campus this summer because I knew that if I went home, I’d just be playing Minecraft all day. So I set myself a basic summer plan:  
UROP ⁠ 01 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program  Going through MIT OpenCourseWare content to make my fall semester a little less hellish, and   exploring Boston and Cambridge. I’ve actually been involved in TMG since the spring semester, but without any exams to worry about, I can now put my UROP in the center of my schedule. I used to watch a lot of the Media Lab’s content back in middle school—specifically most of TMG’s projects—so being able to work inside it this summer is living a fangirl’s dream. I’m working with a TMG project called  , where you have this tray of beads or “sand” that you can manipulate. A sensor above generates a 3D model of the sand, and it changes when you change the sand itself. The idea is that you’re making your own landscape (hence the “Scape” in  ) inside of this sandbox, and the software creates an animated topological map that changes whenever you change what’s in the tray. (Fun fact: This specific 2002 exhibit is about as old as I am, so it’s kind of like I’m working with someone my age.) The 3D model is generated by  openFrameworks The overarching goal of my UROP is to help preserve the projects that TMG has created. Not only am I fine-tuning the software for  , but I’m also going to start updating the code next week for a different project called  TRANSFORM so that it can run on new hardware.  is this beast: Pretty cool! I enjoy my UROP a lot, and I love being around so many amazing people at the lab. I’m going through the lectures for 6.1200 (formerly 6.042), or Mathematics for Computer Science. This is so I don’t get absolutely crushed during my fall semester when I have to take it as a class. If everything goes to plan, I’m also going through 6.1210 (formerly 6.006), or Introduction to Algorithms afterwards. I’m not trying to master either of these before my sophomore year, I just want to familiarize myself with the content and know what I’m getting into. I’ve never learned how to do mathematical proofs, so sometimes it’s intimidating when the professor mentions some mathematical concept and asks if the students have heard of it, and a good amount of people in the video raise their hands. But hey, I’m here to learn, right? I didn’t come here to already know these things. Previous Next I honestly like the 6.1200/6.042 content so far. And even if I don’t 100% know what’s going on with the class material sometimes, going through one recorded lecture a day along with my UROP keeps me on a schedule that leaves me feeling like I’m accomplishing something every day. I couldn’t explore Boston and Cambridge as much as I would’ve liked during the school year, so that’s one of my goals for this summer. After announcing to my roommates that I was “going to a dead guy’s house,” I visited the house of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and stayed in the garden for a little bit before signing myself up for a free guided tour. The whole thing threw me back to when I used to actually read back in middle school, and it motivated me to buy a collection of short stories called  by one of my favorite authors Raymond Carver. I’m proud to say that I read a total of not one, not three, but TWO short stories. I also visited Salem this past Sunday with family friends. I definitely want to go back someday. It’s like someone took the small New England town vibe from   and combined it with  . There was this one shop that had these creepy props of killer clowns and two-headed babies in jars, so that was neat. And I got these guys as a gift: from left to right: Charles, Harper, and Ned Other than that, I’ve been drawing a lot lately and listening to music. I got a sweet view of the Charles River from my summer housing assignment in MacGregor, and I can see “GO C’s” projected on the Prudential Tower from the other side, for the Boston Celtics playing in the NBA Finals tonight. I’m heading to a skate shop this weekend so I can learn how to skateboard before the semester starts. Summer’s good so far.

 It is I, Jacky of the French Dormitory. My culinary journey, as faithfully published here on the blogs by CJ, started  freshman fall sophomore year A lot has happened in the previous year that contributed to my culinary development. I started working at a company that provides excellent lunch, giving me recipe inspirations, and allowing me to focus on what’s for dinner. At the same time, I grappled with changes in my personal life that led me to question my reason for cooking. I believed cooking to be an expression of love – to understand a person and to craft meals specifically tailored for them is, in my opinion, a noble pursuit. Alas,
 
love isn’t always fun and games. ⁠ 01 cj: this is jacky's way of saying relationships are hard It was around that time when I was introduced to Dante Alighieri and his law of   governing punishments and redemptions. I found Dante’s works to be uncannily rich in food metaphors, with perhaps the most famous example being this
 
oft-cited passage in   (The New Life). ⁠ 02 Alighieri, Dante. <em>Vita Nova</em>. Trans. Andrew Frisardi. Evanston: Northwestern UP, 2012. And in one of his hands it seemed that he held something consumed by flame, and I thought I heard him say these words:   – “Behold your heart.” And when he had been there a while, it seemed that he awakened the sleeping lady, and he was doing all he could to get her to eat the thing burning in his hands, which she anxiously ate. ⁠ 03 The eponymous aria in the movie Hannibal is inspired by Dante’s sonnet in La Vita Nuova.  The eating of the heart is a powerful metaphor. Dante had his fed to his beloved Beatrice. For valentine’s day this year, it was about time that I learned some self-love. Thus, braised heart with a chocolate mustard sauce, with goose liver pâté garnished with a tomato rose. The Dantean heart recipe was the result of much exploration and experimentation, through which I rediscovered myself, my palate, and my cooking. The dish happens to represent the three central tenets of my new culinary style:  ⁠ 04 cj: jacky likes blowtorches, you'd think he wasn't a biology major . What a befitting, albeit self-arbitrated,  ! Unfortunately, it is rare for a recipe to involve all three elements like this one. Here are some more demonstrations of each individual technique. .  Dry aging serves a triple purpose: it dehydrates the meat, concentrating flavor; it facilitates the breakdown of protein into savory amino acids, creating extra notes of umami; and it compromises the integrity of muscle fibers, giving tenderness to even the toughest cuts. Dry aging is common in traditional Japanese sushi, but it is rarely seen in the U.S. – shown here is a piece of fatty tuna belly ( ) that has been dry aged for two weeks. -aged ribeye.  A wider-known use of aging is in the steak world. This piece of ribeye was aged in sake lees ( ) for two weeks to imbue it with an intense fermented flavor. It was then paired with a refreshing cloud of yuzu-flavored nagaimo puree, vinegar-marinated scallions, and a crisscross of aged balsamic vinegar and ume dressing. !  Who doesn’t love a flaming twist? Anything, from hearts to omelets to even soups, can contain an element of fiery surprise. It’s not just for show – choosing the right spirit imbues the dish with a blossoming bouquet of flavors and aromas. Left: a borscht with the peaty smokiness of Islay Scotch; right: a roast poussin with notes of apple from calvados.  I am fond of specialty meats, in particular offal (organ meat) – nutritious, flavorful, but often ignored in modern cuisine. My fascination with offal does not stop with the heart. Clockwise from top left: Sacromonte omelet with sweetbreads (thymus); devilled kidneys; tongue  ; and deep-fried brains. Over time, I realized that my new style not only reflects my personality as a chef, but also addresses my needs as a diner. Dinner has become
 
an incredibly calming ritual. ⁠ 05 cj: we all have coping mechanisms, it's just that some involve delectable food Yet sometimes my heart still yearns for something beyond the norm, in a way that exotic meats and novel preparations cannot satisfy. In the Dantean hellscape of burning soups, mutilated organs, and controlled decay that is my new life, I dream of dinner parties and glasses clinking across the table. I dream of having my food mean something more than just an anchor of stability in my life. It is, therefore, extremely fortunate and even redemptive, that I had the opportunity to have food – my favorite medium of expression – contribute towards a higher cause. In April, I oversaw the dining aspect of the “Night Market for Ukraine” fundraiser, jointly held by the MIT Ukrainian Folk Dance Ensemble and the UA. Managing 300-plus portions of food and drinks was certainly a humbling experience, but to me it meant something beyond that. It was a much-needed reminder that beyond the dog-eat-dog rat race, cooking can still be an act of love.  Thank you, MIT Ukrainian Folk Dance, UA, and Ukrainians at MIT for the opportunity to help! At the time of this writing, the war in Ukraine is still ongoing. Here’s an  op-ed I wrote for The Tech MIT-specific resources For more updates about my culinary journey, follow my Instagram  @thefrenchdormitory  element well. Finally, as is customary, attached below is a recipe for your enjoyment. This year, try борщ (borscht), a beet-colored soup that is a classic of Ukrainian cuisine. Each family has their own unique recipe, and here’s mine – try modifying it and making your own unique version! Feel free to share your creations with me, I’d love to hear about your takes on this dish and others! There are a few places where I’ve added my personal touch to this recipe. 1-2 weeks in advance – dry aging the beef 
Day before – prepare borscht 
Day of – reheat borscht, garnish, and serve 
some ⁠ 06 cj: gotta leave it to jacky to put a cryptic 'some' in a recipe list 
Do not let it touch the salt ⁠ 07 cj: this sounds so ominous. what'll happen if it touches the salt? who knows?

Last Sunday, one week ago, I moved out of East Campus. The hours right before were full — packing, friends, watching the sunrise, goodbyes, a nap, more goodbyes, more packing — and then suddenly I was turning in my key and walking out the door. I knew it was coming, of course, ever since I moved in. And in the last few weeks my mind had been increasingly turning over and over the knowledge that I would have to leave. But the moment of checking out still felt unexpected, and surprising: these things always feel more mundane than you think they will. In the time before moving out, finals week rolled into
 
senior week ⁠ 01 I'm not sure if other schools have this, but basically a week between finals and graduation where all the seniors stay on campus and do fun events And the lasts piled up: Last quiz, last assignment turned in. Last meeting of this club and of that committee. Last party, on the last day of classes. Last time linking arms to Don’t Stop Believing, the last song played at every EC party. Many of my senior friends showed up to that last party, and I’ll admit I was more than a little teary as we linked arms. On my last night in EC, more than two weeks after that last party, I was hanging out and packing when we heard that there was an alumni event happening in the Stata courtyard nearby. As “MIT’s newest alumni” (a term I did not want to contemplate too thoroughly), we had been invited, but none of us had read the email. Oops. Despite not having registered in advance like we were supposed to,
 
we had no problems getting in, ⁠ 02 I will not comment on our method of getting in At midnight, the band said goodnight, but the crowd begged for an encore. They clearly hadn’t planned on doing one, but after a lot of shouting (“one more song! three more songs! ten more songs!”) and some equipment finagling, they gave in. And someone at the front of the crowd must have lived in a certain dorm, and whispered a certain something in a band member’s ear, because they played Don’t Stop Believing. We all screamed, and I cried as the song played. Partly because in one sense it was my last time hearing it. Partly because hearing it at an alumni party, after I’d thought I’d already heard it for the last time, meant that maybe in another sense, it wasn’t. Sometimes I catch myself saying I lived in EC “all four years”. Then I have to take it back, because although I wish I did, that’s not really true: there was a 1.5-year-long pandemic-shaped gap, smack in the middle. But in another sense, even during that gap, I lived there as much as
 
any of us did: ⁠ 03 This isn't quite true because some people actually did live in the dorm during one or two of those semesters, but (1) they were still mostly interacting virtually (2) allow me some poetic license But if we go by those rules, then I don’t think I’m moving out of EC, either. Next year I’ll be pursuing a Master’s at MIT, which means I need a place to stay in Cambridge. I’ll be living in a little apartment in Central Square with three of my friends, all of whom I met (among other places) at EC. Hopefully, our friends who still live there will come visit us, maybe at our house’s weekly hangout and/or dessert night, a tradition among some EC halls and
 
cruft houses. ⁠ 04 Cruft are alumni, cruft houses are apartments where a bunch of alumni live So… physically, last Sunday, I moved out of East Campus. Mentally, some part of me will always be there — or maybe what I mean is, some part of EC will always be here with me. The place where I got four years’ worth of better at being myself, at loving myself, at loving other people; where I made friendships I know will last me the rest of my life; where I became an adult. These things will stick with me forever. I might have to leave, but I don’t have to stop believing. #East Campus

Two years ago I posted about an experiment  that lead to the creation of the Super Secret Student Marketing Team. At that time it was just Alison ’23, Emily ’22, and Felix ’23. It was cool. We drew some things, wrote some things, designed some things, and gave away a bunch of playlists. You know, vibes and all that. A year ago we expanded on the idea of the experiment  to see what would happen if we took four students (only two of whom knew each other) living in four different time zones and asked them to animate and score a Pi Day video…even though they had almost no animation experience. This led to the Secret Team growing by three more members: Karthik ’22, Angela ’24, and  Audrey ’24. After realizing I’ve done a team update for the
 
past two years ⁠ 01 and having a few 2026s ask me what this team does

bad. ⁠ 04 most of the time... Previous Next Oh, we also made more videos this year. Of course you had the 2022 Pi Day video that Angela and Audrey  already blogged about, but there were a few other additions to the YouTube library. We asked Daniel ’25 if he could create a video for the incoming class. I remembered him from WISE . Oh! And as part of his application, he’d also written and performed a song about why we should admit him to MIT, so I figured he might do something interesting. Honestly, I hadn’t planned on Daniel becoming an official member of the Secret Team, but between him producing the beat, writing the lyrics, buying the green screen, and directing/starring in the video, I had no choice but to add him. I mean…just watch it! All right. I guess we can talk about the other new member of the secret team: Margaret ’23. Margaret is the mother of Wide Tim  and, as some of you may know, Wide Tim has amassed a cult-like following  that is so strong he leapt from the 2D realm to the IRL world. From stickers, to reaction emojis, to giant faces, to shirts, to zoom backgrounds and cardboard cutouts, Wide Tim has become a movement. Previous Next Now that’s not everything or everyone one.

But, I think CJ ‘23’s comment sums up my expectations for the Secret Team and how I believe MIT should be represented. There is no one version of this place.

i watched the anime   last year and liked it a lot. there’s one short scene i want to talk about in this post; it is probably my favorite 30 seconds of the entire show (minimal spoilers present and no context required): https://looptube.io/?videoId=ZNHFnlnJVi8&start=100.22654867256628&end=130.01415929203532&rate=1 in this scene, one of the antagonists appears and transforms into a titan. the commander of the protagonists sees this and shouts   as he knows the other antagonists must be nearby. however, before he can even finish his command, the rest of the enemy titans materialize behind him, and then the commander turns around and realizes he is probably screwed. in other words, by the time he knows to look for the other antagonists, they have already arrived this reminds me of a game i played as a kid, the   series the game works as follows: each round, some   (balloons) appear on the screen and your job is to pop as many of them as possible. you pop bloons by placing   with abilities like freezing bloons or throwing darts. you have some fixed number of lives (say, 200) and each bloon you’re not able to pop results in the loss of 1 life many of my classmates played bloons tower defense every day during my elementary school recess. while watching them play, i noticed a pattern that i was not able to explain at the time: although each player started with 200 lives, if there was ever a round where they lost a few lives then they would usually lose the entire game within the next 1-5 rounds now that i’m older i think i understand why this happened. for the most part, each round in bloons tower defense is harder than the previous one by a nontrivial margin. this means that if your towers aren’t capable of popping all the bloons in one round, they’ll probably do even worse on subsequent rounds, so unless you’re experienced or have been saving up money for a major purchase you’re likely to quickly reach a round where your towers are completely outmatched and you lose all your lives the common thread in these examples is this:  . this is because the problem’s effects might be a very late signal for the problem’s emergence. in many cases it is such a late signal that it is barely actionable. but enough about anime and flash games; let me give some more legitimate examples: i played piano briefly in elementary school. i was never good, but at some point i got to the state where i could sit in front of the piano, know where all the keys were relative to my body, and, say, play the E5 key with my right index finger without looking at the keyboard. this is a wonderful state to be in because it means you can read sheet music and know where to put your hands without ever having to take your eyes off the music whereas, if you didn’t know where all the keys were, you’d have to alternate between looking at the music and the keys anyway, in fifth grade i quit piano and began practicing very infrequently. i went a few days at a time without practicing, and each time i returned i was still able to remember where all the piano keys were, so i thought i was doing fine. then there was a time where i went a few weeks without touching a piano, and when i came back i could tell where most of the piano keys were but would occasionally mess up, say, 10% of the time.  , i thought,  it turns out a bit of practice wasn’t enough to get me back to 100%; in fact, ever since fifth grade i have never again been able to reliably tell where the keys on a piano are. the problem was that, in using key accuracy as a proxy for piano skill, i’d accidentally equated the two. fifth-grade-me had implicitly assumed the graph of key accuracy vs piano skill looked something like this: when in reality it was something much closer to this: these two graphs are a world apart; in the first one, if your accuracy slips from 100% to 90% you’ve only lost 10% of your ability, while in the second one, by the time your accuracy slips from 100% to 90% you’ve already lost almost all of your ability. the latter is essentially what happened to me with piano; i didn’t have good metrics in place for gauging my piano ability, and as a result, by the time i noticed my decline i could not easily reverse it . i think many forms of procrastination fit this pattern as well. for example, consider this point from one of my favorite  it feels obvious to me that, if you’re trying to make a difficult decision, the realization that you have no time left is a ridiculously late signal for beginning preparations to make the decision. unfortunately, the author of the blog post was right in that this behavior is common among undergrads, i guess because earnestly confronting the question of what to do after college is scary or something . all this illustrates one common solution to the paradigm of not noticing problems until it’s too late to solve them: just notice the problems earlier. notice which bloons your towers struggle against even during the rounds where you don’t lose lives. notice how your fingers can’t make the same motions they used to be able to well before you start missing keys entirely. notice the passage of time every year, every month, every moment of your college experience, not just when you become a senior the other common solution to this paradigm is to plan ahead of time for how you’ll address an issue once you notice it. in other words: you can notice earlier so you have more time to come up with a solution, or you can come up with a solution in advance so that it doesn’t matter if you notice late . freshman fall was easily the worst semester of college for me. it was my lightest semester in terms of courseload, and everything was on pass/fail, but it was also the only semester where i felt truly overwhelmed. i joined many clubs and applied for a biotech urop, and then halfway through the semester classes and social obligations began taking up all my time and i had zero bandwidth for working on research or exploring mit or meeting new people it turns out having no free time is another problem that people tend to not notice they have until it’s too late to address well. you notice late because, after taking on new commitments, the full impact of those commitments on your schedule usually isn’t felt until some weeks or months later. at that point it is too late to address the problem effectively because, once you have no free time, it is difficult to find time to think clearly and decide on a good course of action my life last semester was objectively busier than it was freshman fall, but i never reached zero bandwidth because i’d learned both to notice earlier and to come up with solutions ahead of time. i’d learned to always pay attention to how i felt about the present and the upcoming future, i’d learned to keep an up-to-date ranking of the order in which i’d drop each of my commitments if i had to, and most importantly i’d learned that having no free time was a problem i had to actively combat rather than a problem i could simply avoid without doing anything about it . people often say that you shouldn’t think too hard about your future problems because, regardless of what happens, everything will probably turn out okay in the end. if it wasn’t clear from the rest of this post, i think this sentiment is extremely misleading do i believe you should obsess over the future in a way that worsens your state of mind or comes at the cost of living in the present? of course not. but while the future-focused mind is prone to anxiety, i think many of us, myself included, have overcorrected and begun using the possibility of anxiety as an excuse to justify procrastination and nearsightedness. it’s true that things will probably turn out okay in the end regardless of what you do, but it’s also true that there are many different pathways through which things can turn out okay in the end, and you prefer some of those pathways to others. sometimes i feel like i have forgotten this . i spent the first eighteen years of my life thinking that i could solve all my problems through good fortune and individual brilliance, probably as a result of doing too many math contests. then i became aware of more complex problems like community-building and mental health and startup management. through those encounters one thing has become abundantly clear to me: hard problems do not solve themselves; they are solved by good systems

the awful thing about having three project classes is that the last
 
two weeks ⁠ 01 (realistically, one week) 
Hayden Library ⁠ 02 the newly renovated library located on the east side of campus, a few minutes from the dome needless to say, juggling three projects all at once is a nightmare. i barely remember the weeks i spent finishing my projects since they were so hellish! what i do remember are the blissful weeks i had to myself once classes ended and finals began. with zero finals to study for, i spent my time doing absolutely jack all with my other friends who also had no commitments. my last class was the morning of Monday May 9. i had to present a project, which wasn’t great, but as soon as it ended, i rushed back to my dorm to binge-watch
 
anime ⁠ 03 hunter x hunter, if you're curious the next day, which was the official last day of classes for everyone, i went to see the movie Jujutsu Kaisen 0 with a couple of friends. the movie had come out months before, but we all never had time to see it. thanks, MIT—at least all of us were so hosed we didn’t get to watch it before the others did! that night, there was an East Campus party—the last of the semester. i realized that i’m really going to miss going to EC parties as a dorm resident, since next year i’ll be back in Burton Conner, my freshman year dorm. my EC floor, Slugfest, all pulled up together in our new hall tanks. once the party died, we headed to an off-campus apartment and kept raging, which for some reason resulted in staying up until 6 AM and then sleeping over. as soon as we all woke up, we grabbed brunch at a place called the Donut Diner in Central. let’s just say that their meals “Hungover Man” and “Hungover Woman” came in handy… after brunch, i biked to
 
Kresge ⁠ 04 the auditorium near the student center my design painting… painting more… done! kind of cool. features the address of the apartment the floor hung out at for two years; it served as the “floor away from the floor.” thursday was an adventure. three friends and i headed to the Arnold Arboretum, a gorgeous park that’s about a 20-minute drive from MIT. we spent the day there just hanging out and exploring the different sorts of plants. i seldom get to spend time in nature, so it was a lovely day. into the wild on friday, i got brunch with a MIT friend and hung out around East Campus before going to dinner with some members of Burton Conner exec. we went to a really nice restaurant in Somerville and got a   of food and drinks as a reward for all the grueling work we’ve had to endure this semester due to the dorm’s reopening. after, i biked to the Kendall T station and took the train to the Boston Commons, where i watched the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once with some friends. it was mind-blowing and one of my favorite movies of the past several years, if not of all time. the next day, i went shopping with my little since i had to buy new clothes for my internship this summer. we browsed Newbury Street and i blew so much damn money. it was worth it, though—my previous wardrobe would simply not cut it. on Sunday, i acquired even more clothes at my friend’s
 
senior sale, ⁠ 05 man, one thing i will not miss once i graduate is the onslaught of senior sale emails every May. it's so annoying another week, another seven days of doing nothing at all! on Monday, i went to a brewery in seaport with one of my best friends and spent the day wandering Boston with him. i also got pictures back from a dance showcase my team, Mocha Moves, performed at in April. look how dope we look!! closer piece interlude i choreographed to the song Girl Blunt i had a lot of qualms about MIT dance this year, but everything worked out. i had a great time! Tuesday the 17th was when i realized how much packing i have to do. move out day for all non-seniors was the 19th, but i had begged for a last-minute housing extension until the 22nd. i had no confirmation i’d received the extension, but i delayed packing nonetheless! before i started putting everything away, i took pictures of my room to commemorate it. it served me well this year; i hosted dozens and dozens of gatherings there. even though i’ll be a senior next year, my Burton Conner single will be much smaller than this room. oh, well rip wa408 packing continued on Wednesday, and in the afternoon, a dozen friends and i gathered on
 
Killian ⁠ 06 lawn in front of the dome Saturday was the day i was supposed to leave. i spent the entire day frantically packing and recruited some friends to help me move my stuff down three flights of stairs. and by moving things, i mean 1. throwing garbage bags of clothes out the window and 2. tossing my giant rug down the stairs. alas, when my dad came to pick me up, i realized that all my shit wouldn’t fit in his car. i had to last-minute cram a ton of things into EC storage, which is prone to many mysteries including cockroaches and water damage from flooding. i hope my belongings will survive the summer!! home was fun as usual, but a few days in, i tested positive. oops!!! turns out i was one of the last of my friends to be taken out by COVID. i started quarantining in my room, which wasn’t bad at all since i normally spend all day reading or watching TV anyways whenever i’m home. with all the free time, i got through Breaking Bad at a breakneck speed and then read four books about the 60s counterculture movement. woo! once my quarantine ended and i tested negative, i headed to Boston for my sister’s graduation ceremony. although she graduated last year, ’20s and ’21s got their own celebration, where they could receive “diplomas” in front of friends and family. the ceremony was long and tedious, but it was my first time attending a graduation  , and i was thrilled to see my sister walk. nisha d. ’21 reveal later, i left to meet up with friends before the music festival Boston Calling. i had copped cheap 3-day tickets from a random MIT student who had emailed out about them, so i was hype. sadly, the two bands i was planning on seeing, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard and The Strokes, both dropped out due to COVID. it was also thunderstorming, so i couldn’t go see any other bands. it was a bummer, but courtesy of my sister, i could go to the recent MIT grad bash, where i met up with a bunch of ’21s and ’20s i hadn’t seen since before the pandemic. the “bash” was a party inside a tent that featured foosball, cornhole, seesaws, and of course, a dance floor with a live band. the evening was an emotional and very fun haze. afterwards, my floor brought all the alumni to the apartment where we’ve partied at since Burton Conner shut down. hanging out with them there was insane. we screamed the lyrics to all the songs we played when we were back in BC and it felt so right!! the next day, i went to Boston Calling with two friends. i saw a few bands, including Djo, Japanese Breakfast, and Glass Animals. i wouldn’t say it was the best use of my 3-day pass, but ah well. i headed back to New Hampshire the next afternoon, thus ending my two weeks of post-semester fun. these past several days have been some of the best of my college experience so far. seeing the seniors off was bittersweet, but thanks to having no finals, i was able to spend quality time with them before they leave. summer means endings and also beginnings, i guess next week is my training week for my internship, and then i head to NYC for the summer! stay tuned, there’s lots to come :)

“this guy is extremely shirtless,” jeff says, pulling up a messenger profile. i peer over at his phone, and indeed, the guy is quite shirtless. it’s tuesday the 24th and we’re waiting outside a house in mid-cambridge to pick up a desk that jeff bought from someone for $10. it’s a nice neighborhood, and the sun is starting to set, casting a golden glow over the well-tended bushes and glinting through the trees. we passed a playground earlier, along with a yellow house that stopped me in my tracks. “that looks a lot like a house i saw when we were wandering cambridge during camp,” i say, pulling out my phone to try and find the picture i took. it turns out it wasn’t the same house — but the blue sky and the warm colors struck a chord in my memory. jeff and i met four years ago in the summer after our sophomore year of high school. we were here for a biology camp in cambridge, and we quickly discovered we had the same memey sense of humor. july 2018 was defined by despacito,
 
t-posing, ⁠ 01 i think the first picture i ever took on killian court was of me and the rest of the camp t-posing. a little silly looking back, but you must kill the part of you that cringes, not the part of you that is cringe jeff is from california, and as someone who went to high school in minnesota, i feel like all californians are weirdly obsessed with minnesota. it’s like they can’t wrap their heads around the concept of a state that has all four seasons (no shade). i flexed my ability to withstand the cold and he roasted me for calling it “bubble tea” instead of
 
boba. ⁠ 02 i've changed my ways since because admittedly, boba is easier and faster to say than bubble tea. i think it was a product of the fact that we had like, one gentrified boba shop (sencha) by my high school that branded it as bubble tea. i loved that place in high school, but compared to boba in chinatown... we kept in touch and met up a couple times after that, once at a journalism convention in senior year of high school and most recently during my trip to new york for spring break, since jeff goes to columbia. we visited flushing together and spent a few hours exploring all the incredible food options there. four years later, we’re reunited in cambridge once more. he’s doing some sort of cool brain research and secured an apartment in central square, super close to five spices — one of my favorite restaurants ever. their chili oil wontons remind me of visiting my grandparents in sichuan. we both have a lot more hair than the last time we were in the same place. he had a buzzcut, and i had just gotten a haircut that, looking back, gave me the appearance of a middle-aged mom. after coming back home, i ended up cutting even more of it off, turning it into a pixie cut. baby me with my short hair!! and then i spent the next four years growing it out again. it cascades down my back once more, in all its bleached glory. jeff’s grown his hair out too — it reaches his chin now. there’s some sort of metaphor about hair and growth and change here. despite the both of us looking quite different, there’s a lot of stuff that’s remained the same, like our humor, even though it’s evolved into your standard “amogus sussy imposter baka based poggers so true bestie yass naur” chronically online mix. “people at columbia don’t say poggers,” jeff told me. “they just don’t laugh at it for some reason. one time someone even told me to like, shut up.” this was, quite frankly, appalling to me, and proof that there is something wrong with ivy league kids. here’s one of the signs in the florey kitchen, for reference: courtesy of martin however, i did end up asking one of my other columbia friends about this, and it looks like it probably depends on the friend group. tiffany is someone i went to middle school with, and we saw each other through the peak of our middle school anime phases. she visited me at the beginning of the school year, last fall, and we got lunch at tatte’s, she introduced me to the concept of shakshouka, and i showed her around campus. recently there was some news about the  hunter x hunter mangaka starting to draw again i guess i’ve been revisiting a lot of old friendships like jeff and tiffany. a few days ago, my high school friend ryan texted me asking if i wanted to play minecraft with a few of my other high school friends. willow also managed to dig up files from our
 
senior project, ⁠ 03 a graduation requirement for my high school--every senior gets the month of may off to pursue a project mit’s minecraft version in the end, we didn’t finish it to a level of using it for tours, but it looked pretty nice. the front entrance of our school another close high school friend, quinn, also texted me recently, asking if i could look over her short story. quinn’s always been an incredible writer. in our senior year, we were in charge of the school newspaper together — she managed the print version and i managed the website. it’s a short story that i’ve read before, but this time, she’s added some more details. it’s about a woman with chronic pain who wanders into an open mic night, where she meets someone and realizes some things about how comedy can be used as a way to cope with pain, as well as who gets to laugh at that pain. i gave her some feedback, we chatted a bit, and then she asked: “you’re researching over the summer, right? what are you researching?” i saw it in my notifications and i didn’t know how to respond, so i didn’t open the texts for a few days. later on, someone else asked me the same question: “what are you doing over the summer?” i met this person through  audrey c. ’25 quotebots we’ve talked quite a bit over the past few weeks, with topics ranging from phoebe bridgers to the transition from childhood to navigating friendships to the grindset culture at our schools. but when she asked about my summer plans, i once again balked. it felt like i wasn’t doing anything huge over the summer. i wasn’t doing a big fancy internship like my friends. i wasn’t doing a urop, either. all i was really doing was working at the front desk at my dorm to get free summer housing. i had so much existential dread over updating my resume that i had to wait till chris helped me look over it and add some of the stuff i’ve done. but that was the problem — i felt like i hadn’t done  . i felt like the only thing i’d achieved all semester was decrease my gpa. (which isn’t fair to myself at all, considering the  difficulty i took a visit to urgent care and the nurse asked me what i was doing over the summer. i told her. “that’s nice!” she said, in the middle of typing up my prescription. “i feel like a lot of mit students are always doing so much, but you actually have the time to take care of yourself and pursue some personal projects.” and i guess i really have. i started drawing again, finally. just some simple anatomy studies and original character doodles, but it’s something nonetheless. my original characters, roxy and cecelia and i’ve been voluntarily coding things. i was lying in bed one afternoon and started thinking about how i have to take 6.009/6.1010 (fundamentals of programming) next semester, and i jolted upright because i was like, “holy shit, coding is actually pretty fun.” what i didn’t like about 6.006/6.1210 (intro to algorithms) is that it didn’t have a lot of hands-on projects other than the coding portions on psets, and it was hard for me to wrap my head around the algorithms without doing it myself. but when i did have to do the coding portions, it felt natural for me to get in the zone and spend a couple hours debugging until i passed all my test cases. so…i made a  leetcode which, whoa!!! i guess i have learned some things from my course 6 classes after all. sometimes, it feels like i’m so behind. i came into mit with so many ideas for what i was going to do, and it feels like depression and burnout just hit me over the head and said no, actually, you’re not going to do any of those things, and you’re going to sit there and feel bad about it, and you’re also going to watch all your friends do cool things and you’re going to keep sitting there and feel even worse about it. despite minimizing the things i was doing last semester, i didn’t get stellar grades. but this place chews you up enough that when given the opportunity to choose self care, it’s a wise decision. so this summer, i’m going to keep catching up with old friends and i’ll reach out to people i didn’t get to spend much time with during the semester. i’ll go to my morning shifts at desk, and shop at trader joe’s, and draw things that make me happy, and cook good food for myself, and keep my room clean, and code things just for the fun of it. most recently, i was given the opportunity to do some research with distinctive collections and create a digital archive for east campus history, with funding through

I love cities, and I’ve lived in cities all my life. I grew up in Manila, lived three years in Boston, and am now spending the summer in San Francisco. Well, I lived in Manila, as much as I’ve lived in Boston and San Francisco: not at all. My hometown is Valenzuela, an hour long commute from Manila; MIT is in Cambridge, a forty minute walk to downtown Boston; and right now I’m in Mountain View, an hour long drive from SF. The scales of the metropolitan areas involved vary. Metro Manila is a well-defined region, having around 640 square kilometers and 13.5 million people. Greater Boston, depending on how you define it, is about the same size, with 5 million people. Both of these are small compared to the Bay; even the smallest definitions put the Bay Area over 18000 square kilometers and 7.8 million people. (to scale) The Bay Area is huge, which makes certain things hard, like commuting. Metro Manila’s public transportation isn’t great, but it’s serviceable. Among the trains, jeeps, buses, and tricycles, it was always possible to get from point A to point B in an hour on average. The delay’s not due to waiting or a lack of options, but due to traffic, so owning a car doesn’t make it any faster. In Boston, anywhere I’d ever wanted to go, I’d gotten to in at worst an hour; most of the time, less than twenty minutes. The MBTA is that good. But the Bay? Oh, public transportation  . The Caltrain exists, so does BART, and a dozen other privately-owned transit companies service the rest. Yet the timing’s always inconvenient. The headway’s on the scale of half-hours or hours. If your destination isn’t in downtown someplace, you’d probably have to walk for half an hour. I have a friend who’s also living in Mountain View for the summer, and his place is a thirty-minute walk away. And the fastest way to commute there is a thirty-minute walk. It feels impossible to reliably commute without either living and working near transit stations and planning meticulous schedules, or having a car. I don’t know how to drive, I hate riding in cars, and I hate ride apps, but time and again it seems like the most reasonable option to get places. The size of the Bay Area also means that things are far from each other. For example, a friend was recommending me square dance clubs that were “nearby”, and I said that none of them seemed nearby. “Who said it wasn’t near? I guess it depends on what you mean by near,” they said. “Well, my standard for near is Boston near,” I replied. “Oh,” they said. “Then nothing in the Bay Area is near anything else.” Consider another example. Earlier this spring, I was looking for housing in the Bay for my internship this summer. I rang up some friends and said I’d be living in the Bay, but in my infinite naivete I insisted I’d be living in San Francisco. It took a while before I realized that SF was not at all near Menlo Park, where my office would be. If it was Boston, I could’ve said “Boston” and it would’ve been fine. Finally, consider the distance between Harvard and MIT. It’s a thirty-minute walk, or a fifteen-minute bus ride. Or MIT and Boston University, or MIT and Northeastern, or MIT and Boston College; these were all at most half-hour commutes. But Stanford, Berkeley, Cal State, SJSU? They’re all at least an hour away from each other. the mentioned universities are highlighted in red Another thing that’s startled me is how expensive everything is. Case in point:  . It was challenging to find a place to stay at that wasn’t in the middle of nowhere, or way overbudget. My roommates and I settled for an Airbnb in the middle of a suburb; I’d have wanted to stay closer to the office, or at least closer to a Caltrain station, but there weren’t any good options. Rent is expensive, sure, but so is everything else. The place feels   in subtle ways. The Caltrain costs $3.20 one-way, compared to the T, which costs $2.40. A cheese quesadilla costs $6.00 at  , of all places. This sliver of a cheesecake, no wider than two fingers, cost $4.50! it was good cheesecake though I thought I’d already done the  purchasing power culture shock It’s not all worse, though. The weather here is  . Look at this week’s forecast, compared to Cambridge or Manila. I’ve worn nothing but shirts all week, and that doesn’t seem like it’ll change any time soon. (in celsius) I also some work outside. On my laptop. And it’s not miserable and cold. Sometimes, in the middle of work, I go out and take a walk to think about a tricky part of the codebase, and it helps clear my mind. Also, last Thursday, the interns for our company had a picnic. A picnic! On actual grass! In a Menlo Park park! Can you believe that? Hell, I still can’t. The place is beautiful, at times. If you ignore the empty highways, there’s flowers and trees and leaves on the ground. Sunsets linger past dinnertime, and I can tolerate being outside for long enough to watch them. i saw these while taking a walk the other day Some things are neither better, nor worse, but different, like living in a suburb. Well, it’s worse in some ways; I miss the activity of a city, of having everywhere I’d ever want to go be a few minutes away. But it’s quiet out here, and the nights get dark. It feels like a break, which is nice in some ways. If I had to pick between living in a city or living in a suburb for the rest of my life, I’d probably pick a city, but for now, a suburb is nice. And while some things are different, others are much the same. The people I’ve met at work feel like the people I’ve met in MIT. It feels like I can match them one-to-one: this person from work and that person from MIT are both avid Linux users, this person and that person dress the same way, these people both like Hunter × Hunter, these people like the same kinds of food, these people both like woodworking, these people  worry about the same problems Part of why I wanted to do this internship was to experience the world outside MIT. And it’s different, yes! But if I step back and blur my eyes a bit, it almost feels like it’s the same people with different names. Does that mean the world, at large, is more like MIT than I thought it’d be? Or does that mean the MIT bubble is larger than MIT? It’s probably both, but in ways I’ll only learn about as I go.

In that moment, I felt that my conception of [Next House] finally contracted, collapsing from a community to a few lonely souls haunting a space filled with memories too large to contain any of us. It is the end of my junior year, and I am twenty. There is something frighteningly final about these two statements. I will never be a junior again. I will never be a teenager again. I feel like I should have learned something about the world by now, because suddenly all the questions I am asking myself have changed from “what happens now?” to “what happens next?” and there is so, so much static I hear whenever I ask myself this question, pounding and pounding away,  — Let’s start again. It is the end of my junior year, and I am twenty. There are so many stories I want to tell you about this semester. Eventually, one-by-one, they will spill from my fingertips: dropping a class for the first time, changing my major, making music, writing poems—the list goes on. These posts will be happy, encouraging; they will reflect the growth I’ve felt in the corners of this semester. I am becoming a person, slowly  containing more and more multitudes The truth is, however, that most of this semester has been extremely difficult, in ways that I both could and could not foresee going into it. Many of the weeks have been unfortunate at best and excruciating at worst. It is possible, of course, that this pain was inevitable, or that I have grown from it. That will take time to see though, and in the meantime, I am left to question whether any of it was worth it. Am I becoming the person that I want to be? Is the pain on the way to getting there worth it?  — This time, let’s tell a smaller story. It is the end of my junior year, I am twenty, and I am alone again. Two years ago, in March of 2020, I was the last person to leave my wing of Next House. I packed up everything I owned into cardboard boxes, packed up all of the plushies and computers in my wing into cardboard boxes, and then rolled my suitcase out of Next House, not to return until the fall. It was a solitary experience—lonely, with a sort of withheld sadness. It was not something I hoped to experience again. Last summer, I was the last person to leave my wing of Next House. I rolled my possessions in a cart up Amherst Alley, moving just two buildings over to MacGregor House. The only people left on campus were those who had exception housing, for one reason or another, and so I rolled the cart along, once again sad to be moving out alone,  albeit slightly more excited to be moving outwards This year, of course, was different. The spring semester was a “normal” spring, something that no student had experienced before except for the seniors. The semester itself was difficult, but the normalcy promised something different. There would be more students living in summer housing this year. There would be seniors staying around for commencement. There would still be friends hanging around campus, at least for a little while. In short, I would not be quite so quickly alone at the end of the term. On the other hand, as the end of the term arrived, I was unlucky enough to be saddled with three finals, meaning that I spent the last three days of my junior year studying for and taking exams. By the time I had recovered, many of my underclassmen friends were already gone. Yet, even though I felt sad that I had missed saying ‘goodbye’ to them, I felt happy to know that I would see them again in the fall. I felt happy that there were still friends around—seniors, people volunteering for commencement, desk workers, people with summer UROPs and internships in the area. The studying that I had done had paid off too—I did pretty well on my finals—so all-in-all, I was happy. Senior week went by quickly. There were lots of shared meals, lots of time spent together in the main lounge, and lots of relishing the time we had left together. With the rush of the semester finally over, there was an opportunity to step back and really enjoy life again, and so I did just that. Sure, there were tasks that kept coming up, but I did my best to keep them small, and focused on spending a lot of time with my friends, and I was happy. Finally, Friday was Commencement. I volunteered so I could see all of my senior friends walk across the stage and get their diplomas. We got pictures together and ate together and sang together, and we celebrated. In the moment, I thought I might be sadder to see my friends prepare to go, but I was so happy to see their work pay off, and to see them walk across the stage. They had done it. one of many, many photos Saturday was a frenzy of packing and of saying goodbye to folks who were leaving slightly earlier. My roommate left in the early morning, leaving me with all the rest of the room to pack and clean up, and the realization that I had a lot more stuff than I thought I did. I missed him already. Time was running short. Eleven of us went to dinner together Saturday night, and though none of us said it out loud, it was, in many ways, a last supper of sorts. We packed up the main lounge together this time. On Sunday, one by one, all the remaining people trickled out of Next House. For each leaving senior, we’d gather a farewell party, waving at the Uber as it went up Amherst Alley, and then catching it again as it went down Memorial Drive. Slowly, the people bidding farewell became the people being bid farewell, until just two of us—both juniors—remained. We ate lunch together, and then returned to Next, running out the dregs of our time together. Eventually, it was his turn to go, and I was alone again. There is something magical about the feeling of walking down an empty hallway. In the fall, the empty hallway feels like an infinite source of potential. There is another set of memories to be made, new stories to be told, and new friends with whom to share the ups and downs of life. In the spring, the empty hallway represents a husk, a shell from which all the life has been removed. The field has been harvested; it will lay fallow for a while yet. For the past two weeks, I had been looking forward to being alone this summer. I am by nature an introvert, and spending so much time with people and being so busy has been draining, regardless of enjoyment. The truth is, however, that being the last person to leave is always difficult. And, sure, there are more people around now than there have been in past years, and there will be people again in the fall, but moving out still feels solitary. It reeks of finality, even if I know I will be back in the fall. It is especially hard to move through the sadness of seeing the graduating seniors who have made your life so wonderful for the past year or more go. As I finish my packing, I think about  . Maybe I have seen some of these people for the last time, eaten a meal with them for the last time, played   with them for the last time, the list goes on. Maybe we will meet again, but under what circumstances? How long will we be able to talk for? How different will we be? This group of people, this semester—this is what home meant for me, and now it is gone. Soon, it will be my turn for lasts. My last REX, my last first day of undergrad, my last major requirement, the list goes on. I’ve grown a lot at MIT, and I have learned so much in the past three years. I have many unanswered questions: What comes next?  How do I prioritize the people and activities in my life Of course, there will be people again in the fall, and there will be home again. It will be different—not better, not worse, but different. Different people to spend my lasts with, to answer life’s great questions with. Each group of people is special, and the unique circumstances of this semester will not be the same as the unique circumstances of next semester. The oft-quoted A.A. Milne line goes “how lucky am I to have something which makes saying goodbye so hard.” How lucky am I to have people who make saying goodbye so hard. It is the start of my senior summer, I am twenty, and I am alone, but not really, and not for long. I stand on the threshold of my room, all of my belongings packed into boxes and suitcases as I prepare to move to my summer assignment. I look over the room one last time— —and I turn out the lights.

alternate titles include: on taking too many damn classes; should we take less than 60 units? As of writing this, I’m finished with my sophomore year, halfway through MIT. I’m choosing classes for next semester. My mom once told me about an experiment where lemmings learned to swim through
 
mazes. ⁠ 01 I asked her about it now and apparently the story is entirely apocryphal, alas So anyway, I think a smart idea would be to take six classes, bitch about it, have no time…  for reference, a lemming My usual method for choosing classes is to sign up for 12 of them, the maximum, and then treat the first two weeks as ‘reading period.’ This works, in that I am currently alive and well, but those two weeks are fairly sleepless, as I try to keep up with all of the readings and do all of the psets for those 12 classes. I choose which classes to stick with based on which classes have psets due which I do not want to finish. I also have a tendency to try and take as many classes as I can, then promise to drop some of them. But I’m extremely averse to dropping classes later on in the semester — sunk-cost fallacy — so instead I suffer. And end up with a lot of credits!  As a history double major, I take a lot of
 
HASS ⁠ 02 humanities, arts, & social science 
allowed me ⁠ 03 freshmen have a credit limit boo :( I’m trying to define my learning goals for the upcoming semester — academic, professional, social. Maybe taking six classes again would be the best option; but maybe it wouldn’t be. So I’m looking at how I stumbled through this maze before. A Brief Overview of Past Semesters (there is a tl;dr below) Freshman fall: 8.012, Classical Mechanics (physics I) 5.112, Intro to Chemistry 21W.755, Reading and Writing Short Stories 21H.131, History of Ancient Greece [3-unit discovery class] Physics of Energy Units: 48 + 3 I also worked a UROP with the Rapid Response Group. I remember cooking a lot, running every day, and hanging out with my roommates without feeling dread about psets the next day. I understood a lot more of my psets. I read the entirety of the textbook for Greek History, did not miss a reading for the short stories class.  I started a new novel. For the last month or so of term, I’d go out and write for a few days a week. These were good, solid writing sessions. I sometimes felt bad about taking only two technicals, but I know that I wouldn’t have had time to write otherwise. Previous Next Freshman spring: 8.02, electricity and magnetism (physics II) 5.351, 5.352. chemistry labs [4 + 5 units] 5.12, organic chemistry 18.02, multivariable calculus 21H.242, The Enlightenment and the French Revolution Units: 57 I tried writing during this period and quickly realized I didn’t have time. I hung out with my pod a few times per week. I remember pausing one time, reflecting that I was working harder than I’d probably ever worked, and that I did not ever want to do so again.  I started a UROP. I doubled down on working out.  I didn’t enjoy my classes all that much — most of them were GIRs which I felt I should have taken earlier, or tried to ASE out of. Organic chemistry was cool, though. I did all of the readings for my HASS class. I have detailed notes wherein I am fighting with Montesquieu, deriding Rousseau, engaging with Robespierre. I wrote an essay about the development of racism during the Enlightenment which informed how I see the world today. Previous Next Sophomore fall: 21H.270, Latinx in the Age of Empire 21W.757, Fiction Workshop STS.S20, East Campus History [9 units] 18.03, Differential Equations 2.001, Materials and Mechanics 2.678, Circuit Lab [6 units] Units: 63 I moved to East Campus and developed an active social life! Campus was opening up again, and I found that I enjoy hanging out with people. I did maybe half of the readings for the Latinx class, read all of my classmates’ stories but few of the assigned published works for Fiction Workshop, and finished each assignment for EC History a few days late. My takeaways from EC History felt solid, and the class renewed my interest in historical research. Fiction Workshop is a great class, but I was too hosed to write new content for it; instead I submitted chapters of the novel I’d written in summer and received good feedback. I learned a lot from the Latinx history class. In hindsight, however, I wish I had devoted more time to the class, because it offered a lot of great readings that I could have gleaned more from had I, y’know, actually read them. My technical classes were all lecture- and pset-based, though 2.678 also has weekly labs. I learned a lot of new content and really enjoyed working with the meche community. I went to makerspaces about once per week. I picked up new skills, and began to develop an understanding of materials, but could have put more time toward refining those skills. At the end of this semester I was exhausted. I was proud of myself for getting through all those classes — it was only 63 units, but it felt like more — but I also wished I’d had more time to learn fabrication techniques and eat food and sleep.  Previous Next Sophomore spring: 21L.434, Science Fiction 21H.132, History of Rome WGS.275, Race, Gender, and the Environment 2.005, Thermo-fluid Engineering 2.007, Robotics Untis: 60 Notice that I took fewer units this semester! I was quite proud of myself. I had more time — I joined the forge; I performed in MIT Monologues; I actually wrote some blogs. I could not figure out, all semester, if one pset-based class (2.005), one lab-based class (2.007, which took 15 hours per week by the end of the semester), and three HASS classes was ‘a lot’ or ‘a little.’ I felt like I was doing a lot, in that my schedule was always full, and there was always more to do. At the same time, I only had
 
one ⁠ 04 for the first half of term, 2.007 had three weekly assignments, which took quite a bit of time and resembled 1-1.5 psets I spent a lot more time in makerspaces, in and out of 2.007. I grew comfortable on many machines and began to feel at home in the shop. I was in less pain than the previous two semesters. Apparently most kinds of machining are easier on my hands than writing out psets. Who’d’a thunk. I did some readings for my HASS classes. ‘Half’ sounds somewhat generous, but surely more than one out of every three. While studying for the final for the History of Rome, I read over all of my notes for the semester. Every single notes doc included some variation of “imagine if you actually. read. the textbook.”  Spoiler alert: I never did. Previous Next so uhh tl;dr;  freshman fall: took fewer classes, was able to write, ran a lot, absorbed my HASS classes freshman spring: took more classes, worked out a lot, absorbed my one HASS class soph fall: took a fuckton of classes, spent more time being social, ran, everything else fell by the wayside soph spring: took a smaller fuckton of classes, more social time, ran, went to makerspaces What did we learn here (other than how beams bend and get hot) Looking at these patterns, I have some takeaways:  Taking a lot of HASS classes is lovely and fun, but may not be something I have space for next semester. Also, taking fewer of them may mean I can absorb the content to a greater degree. (I think I have taken enough HASSes that I could simply not take any more for the rest of my time here. But I do not want to do that.) Taking a lot of pset-based technicals you don’t particularly care for is annoying, but do-able.  There is no arrangement of classes where you can both graduate on time and also write fiction. It’s kinda lame! But c’est la vie. I want to learn how to Make Things. I have taken a lot of steps in this direction, and I know a big factor is just spending time in shop and picking up skills from mentors and peers. However, I keep trying to define where and how I learn the best — is it by taking classes with big fabrication components, like 2.007? Leaving space in your schedule to pursue personal projects, such as through ProjX? Joining clubs to build things with other people? I have tried all methods save the last, and Solar Car people are scarily competent. Of course, Solar Car people devote a lot of time, sweat, and blood to the team, and I don’t know if I can commit that much time. However, joining an engineering club in general sounds like a good idea. I’ve not worked on a group engineering project since high school, and I think that would be a good skillset to develop. Plus, I love learning from people and suffering in solidarity. So, this brings me to: 1-2 HASS classes 1-2 fabrication MechE classes 2ish normal MechE classes and an engineering club! Right, good job, kiddo, you made a plan. Now let’s pick some classes for next year. a schedule for next semester Here are some classes that look sexy: 2.008 (making yo-yos), 2.671 (Measurement and Instrumentation), 3.096 (architectural ironwork), 4.140 (How to Make (Almost) Anything), a Junot Diaz writing class, a Harvard history class, 2.650 (Sustainable Energy), some other course 2 classes about photovoltaic cells and making lathes. so, 2.003 (dynamics) 2.086 (learning MATLAB) 2.671 (making a poster) 4.140 OR 2.008, not both — 4.140 is harder to get in to, harder in general, and will have fewer people I know. However, it might teach me more than 2.008. Who knows.  3.096 (only if I get into it, which is not guaranteed, as it’s capped at 6 students and I am a course 2 junior, not a course 3 senior) Diaz class OR Sustainable Energy (or photovoltaic cells or that one that’s like underwater robots or…) a history class at Harvard  There is a minor flaw to this plan. The flaw is that, when you count one two three four five six seven, you realize that this is not actually taking fewer classes. It is in fact taking more. Whoops. Lol. (if you know me please imagine that in my actual voice). this is a large number of colorful boxes One easy fix is to not take either 2.003 or 2.086, which are required core classes for Course 2, and which I did not previously have space for because I was too busy taking three HASS classes. (Also, 2.086 conflicted with my CI-H last semester). However, I want to get them out of the way.  Probably I will take 2.671 later, not get in to the Diaz class, and drop Sustainable Energy or whatever else Class #6 would have been. Then that will be 5 classes, which is silly but more possible. Architectural Ironwork seems to be structured more like a HASS class than a technical, too. 2.003 2.086 2.008 Architectural Ironwork a Harvard history class Plus a club, a social life, running,
 
blogs, ⁠ 05 Every semester, I promise myself to write more blogs next semester. This has a success rate akin to my ‘I will read the textbook’ promises in my Roman history notes. when you have fewer colored boxes the colors are less pretty See this looks sane! Wow. Maybe there is some merit to planning things ahead, and publishing said plans in front of all your peers to pressure yourself into planning realistically.

9 am ⁠ 02 that is such an ambitious time. Did I actually wake up that early. A handful of weeks back, Rona messaged the blogger slack about a writing conference in Philly. It was called AWP, which stands for the Association of Writers & Writing Programs, and took place over the tail end of spring break.  Apparently the UA Committee funds travel grants for MIT students to attend conferences. I had a thermo pset and an essay to work on the night I found out about this, so of course I filled out a travel grant application immediately. I wasn’t sure what to expect — but lo and behold, the grant was granted! Our flights, room and board, and registration fees will be fully reimbursed, up to $1000. Current students, take note. Conferences like these are an opportunity to network, but also to engage with community — in this case, a community around a practice that is typically solitary. Literary magazines and publishing companies travelled from all over the country to set up in the ballroom and engage with readers and writers. Like nearly everyone at AWP, I hadn’t been to a conference, writing-centric or otherwise, in years. I was reminded of Phoenix ComicCon, where I’d bounce between talks and the vast hall of booths, except now I was dressed not in a hat and

I think Mat Cauthon would have been proud. I made weighted dice and a wolf's head pendant, too. Previous Next Panels There was no shortage of panel talks: about craft in short fiction, poetry, memoir; environmental writing; diversity in the publishing industry, and writing one’s unique experience in poetry or prose; various steps of the publishing process, and talks that highlighted smaller presses, magazines, and awards.  I made a schedule with twenty-some talks that looked interesting, always with two or three at the same

Readings from Puro Chicanx Writers of the 21st Century Writing Our Whole Selves: Mixed Writers Challenge the Narrow Literary Landscape Craft Lessons from the Submission Queue: Writing & Editing Short Fiction Previous Next The Ballroom The ballroom was full of booths for small presses, MFA programs, and literary journals. I realized early on that I could not buy too many books, or else my budget would be depleted and my suitcase would be full. I did not actually have a suitcase, just a tote bag full of clothes. Instead I bounced around, asking questions, taking pictures and collecting all the free journals I could. I bought several, too. I’d missed this space. It felt just like it had when I left, a year ago, to go to MIT. I was struck by the fact that it would be waiting for me; there would always be panels for burgeoning writers about how to write query letters or polish a manuscript. If the manuscript I wrote in summer doesn’t sing to me anymore (although I really think it does), I can write another, come back and start again. The starting line will still be here. # I bought the new edition of the Colorado Review, a literary magazine. I read the first story sitting on the floor in the hallway. “Disaster Management” by Ariel Katz, if you’re interested. It was about two artists falling out of love: he a photographer, finding success, and she a painter, finding none. I thought of  The Last Five Years . The ending of Katz’s story reminded me of a toned-down, literary version of the next-to-last chunk of Gaiman’s  Neverwhere. Why do artists tell stories of failure? Was it meant to immunize us, so that if our lives in flesh and blood spiraled the way they had in ink on paper, we’d know the trajectory? Would that make the fall any softer? Katz’s protagonist went into tech. She loved her new job and the partner she found. She looked back at a photo her old partner had taken of her, saw a ferocity she had since lost.  # “Are you an MFA student?” several people asked me. I think this is because I was clearly under 30. “No, still an undergrad.”  Directors of MFA programs would then follow up, “Oh, are you looking for an MFA program?” “Actually, I’m in mechanical engineering,” I’d say. I felt a kind of confidence which I knew working in tech would bring.  # The last table I went to was Defunct Literary Magazine. Their vibe was grungy and genre-friendly; their pamphlets were hand-drawn.  “I like your earrings,” the editor said, pointing to my rainbow earrings.  “Thanks,” I said, and then, very subtly, added, “Gotta code,
 
y’know?” ⁠ 05 I do not think I actually did. Nobody in my demographic at that conference seemed particularly straight. I asked what fiction he was looking for. He said, “Anything that a magazine which has the word ‘review’ in it would reject, we want.” I’d passed a lot of magazines with the word ‘review,’ usually following a place name or a quirky noun. They looked pretty cool. Still, I knew what he meant; nearly all of them leaned literary, and many didn’t accept genre submissions at all. There are many homes for many different types of story. I took one of Defunct’s hand-drawn cards, and then it was time to go. five-story staircase leading to a poetry reading Back home I scrawled a poem in my journal the second night in Philadelphia. It was the first time I’d tried to spin words in a while. I kept going back, crossing out excess words, trimming each line. I’d have to dig it up again, but its essence was, what if I had pursued writing completely these past two years? The poem wasn’t regretful, exactly, just sort of nostalgic. Writing is all-consuming, and during my gap year I was happily consumed. At one point I needed to step back from writing a little, to let MIT in. MIT is all-consuming, too; but MIT represents many different fields for me, new avenues to explore. Right now it seems like the best place for me is a jack of all trades, dabbling in meche and in fiction, with various projects and hobbies picked up along the way. This summer, I’m leaning into writing again. I’m in the thick of  Her Body and Other Parties,  drinking in Machado’s prose. #apply for a ua travel grant

 it’s nice to have slack in your schedule. and by  , i don’t mean laziness, or the messaging app. in business, before slack became ubiquitous as a professional chat room, it was a project management term referring to free space in a schedule, like a buffer period. but there’s a subtle difference: buffer is  , slack is not. say alyssa and ben wanted to do a big task XYZ. they split it into three tasks, X, Y, and Z: 
say alyssa and ben were estimating how long it’d take for them to finish all three tasks. alyssa says it’ll take them 4 hours. alyssa does X and ben does Y. after they finish, they both do task Z. then Y has 2 hours of slack: it can be delayed by 2 hours without affecting alyssa’s estimate. there is no buffer in alyssa’s schedule. bob says it’ll take them 5 hours. alyssa does X, ben does Y, then they both do Z. alyssa says, but that only totals 4 hours! and bob replies, yeah, because there’s 1 hour buffer. now Y has 3 hours of slack, because bob added buffer. in both cases, Y has slack, with or without a buffer. to be clear: the choice of how much slack doesn’t depend on alyssa or bob. it depends on the tasks, how long they take and how they depend on each other, and how many people there are. if alyssa and bob wanted more slack in their scheduling, they could’ve divided XYZ differently. the last week of my semester has been busy. despite spending hours cramming for 6.033 computer systems engineering, grading the final for 6.036 introduction to machine learning, and packing for a flight that weekend, things have gone pretty well. i aced 6.033, we finished 6.036 grading in four hours, and i fit everything in my suitcase with room to spare. last friday, i was informed that a friend i haven’t seen in a while was visiting boston. since i had nothing scheduled, i was able to meet up with them, along with two other mutual friends; all four of us lived on floorpi. that night, i realized i didn’t pack my stuffed toy, ice bear. but as i had extra space in my suitcase, i was able to fit ice bear in without much worrying.  that friday night,   friend i haven’t seen in a while visited boston, and they met up with three of their other friends in the area before coming to east campus. of the five of us, then, four had met in a summer camp called promys, and one was someone i had not met before, but someone i had seen around. so both groups were in the lounge at the same time, a group of four who lived in floorpi, and a group of five related by promys, and i was the only person in the intersection. i thought it’d go more awkwardly, as  in my past experiences i joked that “as soon as you’ve played a game with someone, you’ve met them.” well, we played  castlefall the next morning, i had a flight to san francisco. i got maybe two hours of sleep, and a lot of tossing around in bed trying to sleep. i remembered how much i loved airports and hated flying. my two roommates arrived that weekend. we went to the computer history museum, fitting given that we were all doing software engineering internships. i learned their names from all the funny things i wanted to point out to them. sunday night, i was invited to dance with the stanford quads, a square dance club near stanford. in many senses it is the sister club of mit’s tech squares, the club i danced with weekly last year, but now that i’m living in mountain view i needed to find another square dance club to scratch my itch. by convention, everyone wears badges when they’re square dancing, showing the club they’re a member of, so referring to someone by name wasn’t hard. in the quads, after a period of dancing, everyone thanked everyone else in the square by name, individually. people asked me questions about what i’m doing all the way in california, and my awkward self preferred to make eye contact with nametags than faces. we danced until the end of the night, after the sun went down and it was too hard to read people’s nametags. when i thanked people after the last dance, though, i found that i didn’t need to read them.  how do you know when to pause working? with problem sets, i’d stop in between problems. when writing a blog post, i’d stop in between paragraphs or sections. when working on a project, i’d finish a feature or a bugfix. my internship started on monday, and our first week was dedicated to setting up our development environments. it was hard to find breaks in between, as it’d always feel like it’d take one more step before things would work. every time i’d look for a pause, i couldn’t, because it’d be waiting for a download to finish or for a program to build. our first day was filled with onboarding meetings, instructions not turning out as planned, and walking around the office chatting with people. between everything that happened, my roommates and i whiled away our time in the office, until we realized that dinner had passed. the next day, we were gently reminded that we were expected to work eight hours a day, and forty hours a week. i told one of my roommates that there doesn’t feel like a well-defined ending to work. it’s his second summer as an intern. he says that he relates, and that maybe we should try to have more fun. i told a coworker that i don’t know how to manage a work-life balance. he’s been in the company for a year, after finishing his undergrad right before that. he said that neither has he. i told my onboarder that i felt lost, that even though i was given a big list of what to do and in what order, i still didn’t know what i should be doing. she finished her bachelor’s four years ago, and this is her second job. she said that sometimes she feels the same. and it’s nice to know that people think about the same things i do, even if they aren’t as outspoken about it.

[warning: contains spoilers for the cartoon show adventure time] I recently finished watching Adventure Time, a fantasy cartoon written by Pendleton Ward that follows Finn the Human and Jake the Dog and their adventures through Ooo, a fictional land with crazy creatures and monsters. I don’t really have the words to describe what this show means to me. I started watching it with my high school boyfriend in junior year, where he swore it was one of his favorite shows ever and insisted I watch it. I didn’t watch Adventure Time growing up because I thought it out to be too childish for my tastes, as the show is riddled with moments of immaturity like farting and pooping jokes. But as I watched, I saw a deeper story unravel before me, where there was so much more than silly bits and gags. (Not that these weren’t enjoyable, I think the immaturity is necessary to understand the show fully.) I took a long break from watching the show after breaking up with my boyfriend, with the show reminding me a bit too much of our relationship. I only then started to pick up the show again after falling into a deep depression during the beginnings of the pandemic. My current boyfriend watched episodes with me, both of us never having seen the show before. It brought me a lot of comfort. I loved how colorful it was. I loved how it seemed to subvert expectations, where characters would show up that I would think to be evil or troublemakers or some problem-causers ended up being pivotal to the show and some of the most lovable characters. I realized how hastily I would make judgments, and how the show seemed to tut at me for it, showing me that perhaps every character, big and small, strange and weird, has some good in them. I took another break from the show, stopping around the middle of season 6, due to just life happening. School was starting up back in person again and so I didn’t continue watching it again until, well, three days ago. I sat in bed and bingewatched seasons 6 through 10, leading us to here. To now! In those ten seasons, the show matures, where you can see the direct growth of all of its characters. Finn, evolving from a flighty, crush-having, immature 12 year old boy, to in the final season a 17 year old “man” (as he deems himself in the episode). As the show came to an end and my screen dimmed, I couldn’t help but think of the evolutions I have made throughout the 4 years I’ve been watching the show, how I, too, changed and grew alongside these characters. Where I went from thinking that the show was childish and simple to understanding the complexities and meaningfulness of it. To opening my heart just a teenie bit more to appreciate the childlike wonder that is Adventure Time. One of the things that resonated most with me was how the show handled relationships. In the show, Finn holds a complicated relationship with his father. His father, being an ex-con-man, has difficulty wringing himself free from his conniving ways. Finn is a hero that embodies goodness and honesty, a seemingly direct opposite to his dad. Time and time again, Finn encounters his father on his journeys, only to be let down by his father’s self-preserving nature. We watch Finn deal with complicated feelings, trying to navigate the disappointment and anger he feels regarding his father. Finally, in “On the Lam”, Finn realizes that no matter how much he confronts his dad about changing, about giving him answers, about feeling any sort of closure to the situation, he will never get that. His father summarizes it best as he tells Finn, “No answer I give you will be satisfying” before disappearing by the whim of a magical cataclysmic comet. As someone who constantly chases closure, constantly pursues finding answers and meaning, this episode hit hard, as Finn sits back and understands that sometimes people cannot change into what we need them to be. Sometimes people are just, as Finn puts it, “crummy dudes.” finn and his dad Other difficult lessons are handled in the relationships in Adventure Time, such as Finn’s relationship with Flame Princess. I found this a particularly touching and important representation, as Finn actually ends up with no one at the end of the series. He spends some episodes of the show in a relationship with Flame Princess, a princess with a fiery personality and some evil origins that rules of the Flame Kingdom. Despite her fire powers that seem to burn Finn, Finn is able to come up with methods and ways so that he doesn’t get burned and they can spend meaningful time with each other. Later in the series, though, Finn messes up their relationship by manipulating Flame Princess, eventually leading to their breakup with Flame Princess citing that Finn has “breached her trust.” What I appreciate in this falling out is that the show never forces Finn and Flame Princess to get back together again. Instead, Flame Princess says that she’s open to Finn and her being friends in the future again, once they both grow. Eventually, Finn apologizes to her and realizes how awful his actions were. But more than this, I appreciate how the show demonstrates Finn’s humanity, that someone we laud in the show to be the embodiment of goodness and honesty and heroism, is someone who is flawed and can partake in toxic activities. That no one is free from fault. But Finn’s goodness allows him to grow from the mistakes of the past. flame princess and finn This show is all about growth, about aging and learning and letting go of the past and moving forward. Being back home, I’ve watched as my room has shed parts of itself to age and mature alongside me. As stuffed animals get packed away and guitar cases open and shut, my home has changed just as I have. My parents have changed. My grandparents, too. Everything around me has been trekking in a path and it’s scary. Change is scary. I watch as my grandparents slowly forget more and more by the day, or as my mother grows more and more tired, as my family members become less and less of my idols and more human in my eyes. That they are good people with faults, faults that are growing clearer to me by the day. It terrifies me, watching people age and watching my perceptions of these people change as time continues onward. And while I wish I could do something to stop it, to pause myself in the good times, I cannot. It would look like: will happen, happening, happened Will happen, happening, happened And there we are again and again ‘Cause you and I will always be back then You and I will always be back then “If I change, will they still love me? Will I still love them? Does growing up just change your body, or also your soul? Maybe I could just stay the same forever.” It’s been hard,   hard, being back home. But through shows like Adventure Time, I’m learning how to deal with change in healthy ways: writing, singing songs, talking it out, and rolling with the flow of things. Nothing lasts forever, and nothing stays the same. It’s one of the scariest truths of this world. But what we can do is appreciate the past, the “back then” and the “happened”, and grow to create the best “will happen” in the “happening.”

The other day, I skivved off studying for thermodynamics and instead biked to D-Lab to weld. I’d started a new project two weeks before finals, and planned that it would take about a third of the hours it did, so I was scrambling slightly to finish. On the way, however, I passed people setting up a stall about a women’s biker club. Security folk were roping off the alleyway between Mass Ave and Windsor Street. Engines revved.  I stumbled into a motorcycle fest — specifically, Wild Rabbit Moto Fest, organized by Madhouse Motors every spring. I’d heard of it from
 
Randomites, ⁠ 01 residents of Random Hall, the soon-to-be last bastion of eastside culture, not to cry doomsday or anything photo courtesy of Madhouse Motors They were still setting up, so I parked my bike, recruited a friend, and returned a few hours later. The street was lined with motorcycles of every style, year and brand, and so many very cool folks. Black t-shirts and chains, ripped jeans and leather. Tattoos and heavy silver rings. Rock and metal blasted through the speakers; half the songs I recognized. Many people were familiar with the band on my shirt. “That album got me through a breakup,” said the cybersecurity tech at an accident law firm. I told her that it got me through a road trip. She asked, “Do you ride?” “No, but I want to.” I bounced from stall to stall. There were biker societies from all over Massachusetts, many of them aimed at women. Harley Davidson had a stall advertising riding lessons. A few accident lawyers were distributing free t-shirts with their firms printed on the front. There were artisan stalls too: t-shirts and biker-themed jewelry, tattoos, prints, handcrafted knives, stained glass, and welded sculptures. One company was offering free test rides on their newest bike. photo courtesy of Madhouse Motors The vibe here was excellent, well-suited to my style. So many people here looked like what I want to be. At the same time, this was an interesting foil to the atmosphere of machine shops and how I exist within them. I was at the moto fest with a white guy who I’d taught how to weld, a nice student, good at taking criticism and asking for advice. I noticed how people addressed him, and how they addressed me, both of us engineers at MIT. It caught me by surprise when some artisans spoke mainly to him. Three stalls down, I remembered that this was a pattern, one I still haven’t figured out a response to. In machine shops, I’ve gotten better at interrupting explanations of mechanisms that I already understand. I’m good at saying I’d rather figure out a process on my own, especially when no one is explaining it to the guys working alongside me. But when the pattern grows more subtle, it’s harder to address. I also noticed, and appreciated, when a woman who worked in stained glass explained her process entirely to me. She was humble and open about her work, and recommended the artists she’d learned from. I bought some lovely earrings from her. Previous Next I met so many badass women. I made a point of speaking to them, and often they to me. There were several all-female biker groups I was too shy to approach, but whom I admired from afar, happy to have found another model to look up to. There were many couples riding together, her arms around his waist, her hair flying in the wind while he turns the gas. I looked, and thought to myself, “That won’t be me.”  I am known, on occasion, to sit in the passenger seat of cars; sitting behind someone on a bike isn’t fundamentally that different. Still, it’s not for me. There was no chip on my shoulder, thinking so. The thought was not frantic, not a little bit afraid that  would  be me, if I weren’t careful. Rather, I felt grounded, calm. I wouldn’t. I’ve always known as much. @wildrabbitmotoshow Finally my friend and I came to the stand where people were test-driving motorcycles. Both of us signed waivers, then looked at the available bikes. There was only one, a two-seater.  I distinctly had a moment of thinking I could just let him ride it and stand to the side. My insurance would take a hit if I crashed. But then I was asking them to remove the back seat, saying I’d wait for the next bike to come back. At the moto fest, every time people asked me, “Do you ride?” and I said, “not yet,” I wondered if I was lying. Maybe I only liked the vibe, and didn’t actually want to ride. Then the second motorcycle came back. The coordinator gave me a helmet, pointed out the gas and brakes. I revved the engine. Then I rode a motorcycle! I didn’t die! I sped down Mass Ave, which can be congested enough in a car. I figured out where the turn signals were on the fly, adjusted the rearview mirrors at a stop sign. I know the streets of Cambridge, but on a motorcycle, my legs exposed, everything seemed to move so fast. I was, for a moment, mildly lost. Then I found my way back, cruising down side streets, easing through tricky left turns. It was so cool. It also felt harrowing, and needlessly difficult. I recalled the first time I’d driven a car, getting lost on familiar streets because I was watching the cars ahead of me with tunnel vision. Or like the first time on a highway, when semi-trucks seemed massive and everything moved too fast. I love highways now; especially the interstate, where the roads are nice and straight, and you can go fast in the leftmost lanes. MIG welding felt similarly difficult not too long ago, and comes more easily to me now. Dismounting from the motorcycle, my legs pumped full of adrenaline, I realized this was what the beginning of a learning curve felt like to me. The next time I rode would be easier. Already I was itching for a next time. I returned to the test site with a triumphant grin. I asked the price, knowing it would be more than I could afford. The coordinator told me about their company, a Swedish start-up which had recently expanded to the US. “Are y’all hiring?” I asked. “We’re looking for talent to do shows like this, yes,” she said. “Oh, no,” I said. “Like, I’m a mechanical engineer at MIT.” That phrase flowed off my tongue the right way, no inflection to it, just fact. When I say it, it feels true. She nodded. “Yeah, reach out to us.” @wildrabbitmotoshow The sun was setting as I left the moto fest, rock music blasting behind me, T-shirts and free merch tucked under my arm. Sometimes you stumble onto a corner of the world that is full of your people. You didn’t even know they were yours.

i’ve been thinking, recently: in times of need, who takes care of me? of course, growing up, the answer was my family. i woke up one morning craving the napa cabbage and meatball soup that my dad used to make. along with the phantom taste of salt and light broth on my tongue, there was something bittersweet, knowing that it’s not something i’ll experience again
 
for a while. ⁠ 01 i've mentioned it before, but both my parents are currently overseas, and with covid restrictions it's hard to see them. my mom's coming back over the summer, but i'll have to find time to go back to china if i want to see my dad, which might be difficult given the average mit student's obligations year-round. and when i was sick a few weeks ago, i found myself desperately missing the ginger-jujube-brown sugar tea that my mom brewed whenever i was feeling under the weather. (when i told her this, she said she was going to mail me a bunch of packets so i could make it myself.) i try to emulate the ghosts of my parents’ actions by dutifully drinking banlangen and  water, not cold water, and taking an assortment of other chinese herbal medicines. i’m not a traditional medicine expert so i’m not entirely sure what they do, but they do make me feel better by virtue of being something familiar–something that reminds me of home and childhood. still, it doesn’t change the fact that when i get sick now, it’s up to me to manage my symptoms and judge if i’m functional enough to do certain things. i guess having to shoulder the responsibility of taking care of myself is just another marker of the transition to full adulthood. it’s a funny stage of life that we’re in right now. i have been ruminating on care, in all its forms, and it boils down to three categories: i think the meaning of self-care has been somewhat diluted over the years. it brings to mind bath bombs and face masks and indulging in a bit of luxury. “self-care is buying yourself a little treat so you can get through the day” is a common phrase i’ve been seeing on twitter lately. and all of those things are definitely very nice. who doesn’t like getting little treats? like, i   going to
 
paris baguette ⁠ 02 it's a bakery in hmart, so every time i go get groceries it's always there to tempt me but i think it somewhat frustrates me because it also feels like it has been commodified by capitalism. i see ads that are like, “buy x product because you are a girlqueen slayboss #selfcare #yass!” self-care, in my opinion, is a lot less glamorous than that. sometimes it’s just the act of putting my phone down when i’ve been stuck in a scrolling loop, paralyzed by existential dread. sometimes it’s replying to messages and emails that i’ve left to sit for weeks, because the longer i put it off the worse it is going to be for my mental health. it’s asking for extensions on psets and essays when i need them and bracing myself against the feeling of being admonished for not reaching out earlier. it’s responding to my body signals instead of ignoring them. it’s pulling myself out of my slumps and bonking my head and being like, “hey, okay, let’s get it together.” it’s knowing what i need and following through on those needs. and yes! it’s hard!! it’s so hard!!! every time i have to fold my laundry or, god forbid, wash my sheets and refit them onto my bed, i want to shrivel up. if it were easy maybe i wouldn’t be depressed. if it were easy maybe a lot of people wouldn’t be depressed. but i have been trying really really really hard to find peace in the mundane, menial tasks that must be repeated every day. i feel like every other post i make is about this. maybe that’s what  camus was talking about i think another marker of adulthood and self-responsibility is actually learning to accept help from other people–and actively   for that help. when you’re a kid, you typically don’t have to go out of your way to ask for things, because your parents are supposed to provide for you already. but then you move out, and now there’s no one automatically tuned in to your needs, and you have to teach yourself how to depend on other people or manage it alone. you don’t have to go through things alone, and you’re not   to. humans are social animals. we’re built to help each other in times of need. most of the time, when people say to let them know if you need anything, they genuinely mean it. realizing this is the first step. it’s like that time when i was experiencing heavy side effects from the third shot back in december and rui and tiffany and sarah brought me food and we all sat in a circle on my dorm floor and ate it together. or when i was having my breakdown in february and multiple friends reached out to me letting me know that they were there if i needed a shoulder to lean on or someone to vent to. or when i asked selena if she could drop off a covid test for me because i was feeling way too weak to make the trek to medical (even though it’s a lot closer for me than it is for my west campus friends). or more recently, when i was in the throes of my mysterious plague in late april and i was miserably curled up in my room and i couldn’t sleep and chris brought me strawberry cough drops, because she wasn’t sure which flavor to get but strawberry seemed to fit my vibes. or when
 
east side festival ⁠ 03 an annual celebration of east side culture, where a bunch of alumni come back to campus and tell stories and there's a giant feast in the courtyard as well as a bunch of other fun stuff it’s all these little moments that remind me that people care!!! and accepting their care is a form of self-care, too. below is a piece from an artist i like that feels relevant, and a playlist i made when i was feeling particularly cared for despite being sick: https://nutnoce.tumblr.com/post/640784988891136000/a-scrap-from-feeling-like-shit-but-also-a-little when chris got sick towards the end of the semester, it was a little rough because it was the week before finals. i then made it my prerogative to bring her as much food as i could over the next few days, as well as some egg socks from hmart (they sell them for like $2 in the new home and cookware section now!!) at one point, i was walking to sevlev late at night because she’d asked me for some gatorade. we were on the phone together because i was alone, it was midnight, and i didn’t want to be kidnapped without anyone knowing. i walked past the giant tents they’d set up outside of stata recently, the ones with the hardwood flooring inside, and crossed the street, making my way past area four and the taqueria with a glowing neon sign that says “feed me tacos and tell me i’m pretty.” entering sevlev, i made a beeline to the drinks section, grabbed gatorade, lingered in front of the ice cream for a bit before choosing a thing of ben and jerry’s, and made my way to the cashier. chris had also asked for cheesy bread, which is just what it sounds like: bread that is cheesy. you have to ask the cashiers to warm it up for you, so: “uhh, do you guys have cheesy bread?” the employee held up a cheeseburger packet. “do you mean this?” “ahhh, no, i mean…cheesy bread…like bread, that’s cheesy? it’s rectangular…i think?” an awkward silence as both of us tried to process the situation–the employee was trying to figure out what the hell i was talking about, and i was trying to remember what cheesy bread looked like because the last time i got it i was paying a lot more attention to how it felt and tasted in my mouth than its appearance. i heard chris giggle on the other end of the line. “hold on,” the employee told me. he yelled for the other person working in the store, who came over and looked at me inquisitively. i offered a weak smile. “i was just wondering if you guys have…cheesy bread?” he beamed. “ah! cheesy bread! yes, we have that. you want one or two?” “one is fine,” i said, breathing out a huge sigh of relief as he warmed it up in the…oven/stove/possibly microwave type thing. i don’t know, i wasn’t really looking that closely. all i know is that a couple minutes later i was walking out of sevlev with two bottles of gatorade, ice cream, and a warm thing of cheesy bread, its delicious scent wafting up into my nose–soon to be delivered to chris’s door. when i’m at tech callers, i tend to end a lot of calls with “take care,” which i think is cute. it’s a habit i picked up from the alumni i’ve called–no matter how short the conversation was, they’ll still tell me to “take care” and if they’re feeling a little more talkative they’ll wish me the best of luck at mit. it’s a small, almost mindless thing, but it’s one of those sweet little tendencies of humanity, to wish well for strangers. i’ll leave you with one of my favorite poems:  small kindnesses I’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk 
down a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs 
to let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you” 
when someone sneezes, a leftover 
from the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying. 
And sometimes, when you spill lemons 
from your grocery bag, someone else will help you 
pick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other. 
We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot, 
and to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile 
at them and for them to smile back. For the waitress 
to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder, 
and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass. 
We have so little of each other, now. So far 
from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange. 
What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these 
fleeting temples we make together when we say, “Here, 
have my seat,” “Go ahead — you first,” “I like your hat.”

In my junior year of high school, I had a phase of telling everyone about how I was going to make my dress for senior prom. I had never used a sewing machine before, but I was armed with the false confidence gained from years of watching
 
DIY fashion youtubers. ⁠ 01 my favorites are coolirpa, withwendy, and Micarah Tewers! I finally had the chance to dust off my dressmaking dreams when Ring Delivery rolled around this past April. Ring Delivery is a major milestone where sophomores receive their brass rats to celebrate completing half of our undergraduate journey through  hell  the Institute. It’s also an incredibly fancy event that expects people to peel off their crusty career fair t-shirts for suits and gowns.  As I prepared to make my dress, I realized that watching DIY fashion youtubers sew doesn’t automatically make you a master seamstress. Who could’ve known?! Thankfully, a mentor at  Metropolis Making the harness required zero patterning and only short stitches. To practice patterning and making longer stitches, which would be required for a fancy dress, I tried to make a circle skirt out of a thrifted dress with a beautiful ukiyo-e style print and some scrap blue fabric. My patterns didn’t quite match up — curse tolerances! And I kept sewing pieces with the incorrect sides together — bless my seam ripper! Nevertheless, it felt good to have a nonzero amount of sewing machine experience under my belt. Sadly I never took a picture of said skirt, and I don’t have it with me at this time.  Onwards towards making my actual dress! After spending who knows how many hours scrolling through Etsy, I decided on this  beautiful black tulle with stars and moons embroidered in gold I decided on making a two piece wrap dress with a tie closure, heavily based on this  tutorial by Micarah Tewers. Tulle was kind of finicky to work with because it scrunched up easily under the sewing machine, but I’m happy with how the top turned out.  To make the skirt piece, I cut, hemmed, and attached a large rectangle of the tulle to another large rectangle of the black cotton. I sewed in some pleats to add some pizzazz (and to hide the fact that my two large rectangles didn’t quite match up).  Here’s my final dress! It wasn’t not as finely crafted as what you’d buy from a store, but I dug the grunginess of my DIY efforts. Wearing it made me feel like a sparkly, magical witch.  photo by Winnie ’24 My hallmates and I first took pics on campus prior to leaving for the Ring Delivery venue:  “let’s take a pillar pic!!” ft. the sophomores of Tetazoo, photo by a kind passerby And then met up with more friends to take pictures at the venue, the glitzy glamorous Fairmont Copley Hotel. Unlike our campus photos, these shots featured brass rats on ring fingers:  more East Campus friends! ugh we look so dapper. photo by Maxwell Yun some of my podmates from freshman spring! photo by unfortunately i forgot :( the venue had fancy little tables for us to eat our fancy little hors d’oeuvres. photo by selfie camera Margaret ’23 looking fashionable as always! There are a million reasons why Margaret is so cool, a few of them being the creator of Wide Tim and a member of the 2023 Ring Committee! Photo by Ria ’24 Ria and I showing off our rings! Ria and I have been friends since middle school and it’s incredible that we both ended up at MIT :3. photo by Margaret Shoutout to the 2024 RingComm for designing the ring and organizing Ring Premiere/Delivery! I’ve heard that making all this happen is an extremely involved and time consuming process.  I’ve never worn a ring regularly before. This hunk of metal chafed slightly against the sides of my pinky and middle fingers. People joked that receiving your brass rat is like marrying the Institute, but it’s quite the shaky marriage. I thought about the two years worth of sleeplessness and exhaustion still ahead of me. That made me think about divorce.  Up close, MIT can look like a depressing concrete monolith. But from afar, especially if you’re looking from the other side of the Charles River under a twinkling night sky, MIT is truly beautiful. After Ring Delivery, a few friends and I frolicked outside for a bit. As the night air swept cold against our skin, we basked in the warm glow of the city lights, the glittery river reflections, and each other’s presence. I felt alive.  see that shiny dome? photo taken by Winnie ’24 As I’m revising this blog post hopefully for the last time before I hit ‘publish,’ I have just finished the semester and flown back home. My first draft, which was written shortly after Ring Delivery, had a much angstier ending. “But a Ring Delivery blog isn’t supposed to be angsty!!” said Kellen, probably. I think distancing myself from MIT is finally starting to soothe that angst. It’s too easy to fixate on the mismatched seams, the uneven hems, the soulsucking psets, and the failed conference submissions. But even if stars are actually just angry hellpits of hot gas, they make a beautiful array of twinkling dots that I can admire from light years away. There are pockets of this hellpit and also of myself that I can learn to love more often. I just have to step back a bit first.  I’m proud of myself for just getting through this semester. And for finally making the dress that I had told everyone that I would back in high school.  #Brass Rat #height of two mugs #IHTFP #Ring Delivery

i. basketball everything in this section is only approximately correct. basketball is a complicated sport and there are many exceptions to every principle i’ve been watching basketball on-and-off for a while now and my favorite part of the game is seeing very effective defense. there are way too many kinds of defense for me to be able to cover them all in this post, so i won’t try to. instead i’ll just say that the most common kind of defense is  man-to-man defense , where each player on the defending team matches up with a person on the offensive team and is responsible for guarding them and following them around the court. like this:  there are some basic principles at work here:  when a player is  open  on offense, meaning there is no defender near them, they tend to make their shots more often than when they’re not open. therefore, defenses usually try to ensure that no player on offense is left open, meaning for each player on offense there is a defender somewhere in their vicinity modern offenses try to make defense harder by  spacing  their five players around the court. this ensures that no defender can effectively guard two offensive players at once, since there is too much physical space between them, forcing each defender to match up with one offensive player. this benefits the offense since the defense has a harder time sending double-teams at the player with the ball (double-teams often result in the defense gaining control of the ball) if there are more players on offense than defense in the vicinity of the basket, the offense has an advantage and can usually score (eg. one defender can’t easily guard two players both near the rim). therefore, most defenders try to stay between the basket and the player they are guarding, to prevent this numerical advantage from ever being realized the natural consequence of these principles is that, most of the time, defenses resemble the above picture: five defenders spread around the court, each one standing in a way that prevents direct runs to the basket. this is the standard setup and is not particularly notable; more interesting to me are the scenarios where the defense has broken down and the offense has an advantage, and the defense must then move efficiently to recover from the breakdown depending on the situation, defenses may be able to recover through good systems or good individual play. here is an example of a good system:  https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ezgif-2-6a6b8f34ac.mp4 the offensive team has created a slight advantage where one of their players is open. however, as soon as the offense passes the ball to the open player, two players on defense immediately rush towards them to prevent that player from scoring. the double-team creates an opening elsewhere in the offense, so the offense passes to the newly-open player, and then the process repeats several more times until the time on the possession has almost run out. this level of defensive coordination is extremely rare since it requires all five defenders to be extremely engaged and responsive to the offense; most teams either have players that don’t care enough about defense to pull this off or have coaches that don’t prioritize defense enough to practice schemes like these. but when plays like this one do happen, i think they are extremely beautiful to watch as for solo defensive plays, there are many varieties of good individual defense. my favorite one is when one player is successfully able to defend against multiple players at once. one notable instance occurred in last year’s nba finals:  the narration in the video does a pretty good job of covering the play itself, though there are a few other things which i think are worth pointing out:  the entire sequence happens in around 2 seconds this scenario usually ends in the offense scoring. the reason it doesn’t happen in this case is that the defender is positioned just forwards enough to prevent the initial ball handler from shooting or driving to the basket, and just backwards enough to be able to block the dunk behind him. without such precise positioning on defense the play probably would have gone very differently for a similar example, here’s an instance where one defender defends against three players at once:  in this play, it might look like the defender is just standing under the basket and not doing anything while the three offensive players pass the ball around and lose it. in reality, the defender steps forward slightly to challenge the player with the ball and prevent that player from scoring immediately, resulting in a pass. however, while stepping forward the defender has also taken care to stay in a good position to be able to guard the other two offensive players if necessary, so after the pass the defender is immediately able to recover to the player the ball was passed to. once again, this only works because of very accurate defensive positioning, and eventually the offense makes a careless pass and the defender is able to intercept it ii. responsibility one of the things i find most interesting about defense in games is its relationship with responsibility. i am of the belief that, while you may not be responsible for the existence of problems in your life, you are responsible for trying your best to solve them. some of my friends have very different opinions on this subject, and this diversity in views is also apparent in differences in how various games treat defensive responsibility on one end of the spectrum are games like football (soccer), where there are situations the defense genuinely cannot defend and therefore is not responsible for. for example, consider the penalty kick:  even with optimal defense from the goalkeeper, penalty kicks usually result in the offense scoring (around 75% of the time in professional football). the reason is that the kick is too fast for the goalkeeper to react effectively to, and the goal is far too wide for the goalkeeper to cover. therefore, the kicker can aim at the far left side or far right side of the goal, and the goalkeeper doesn’t have a better strategy than guessing which side the kicker will aim for and diving to block that side of the goal. the existence of the penalty kick means that it is quite feasible for a football team to play perfect defense the entire game and still lose badly (for a more extreme version of this idea, check out professional foosball, where every shot is essentially unblockable because the table is so small and the ball moves so quickly that you can’t see it) on the other end of the spectrum are games like chess where, as far as we know, perfect defense should always result in a drawn game. of course the game of chess has not been solved yet, so it’s possible that there exist offensive strategies which force wins, but in practice the better two players are the more likely they are to draw. for instance, the draw rate in recent years among grandmasters with rating above 2750 has been over 70%, while the 2018 world chess championship famously resulted in all 12 games being drawn. so in chess we can reasonably say that the defense is responsible for every loss i think basketball occupies a good middle ground within this spectrum. on individual plays, offenses may be able to score against perfect defenses – if a player throws the ball up and it happens to go into the basket then there’s not much anyone can do about that. however, if an offense is able to consistently score over the many possessions that make up a game or series, it is almost always because the defense is strategizing or executing incorrectly. in this way the defense is not responsible for the outcomes of any individual possession, but it is responsible for the longer-term trends that emerge in a game or series or season iii. work one of the reasons i pay attention to good defense is that i view all day-to-day work as fundamentally defensive. here are some examples of what i mean:  people who run startups often describe their work as a non-stop race to put out fires as they emerge, and also to prevent those fires from emerging in the first place hygiene, workouts, and diets are all primarily preventative measures which guard against issues like infection, atrophy, and heart disease, respectively. good health is not about the accumulation of positive assets as much as it is about the evasion of negative health problems every day i have a list of tasks that i would like to finish. the framing of “here are today’s problems, now go and solve them” is inherently a defensive one in my mind. (of course, since i’m also the one coming up with the lists, you could argue that i’m also running the offense. i have no objection to this) i’m not trying to convince you that all work is defense; if it makes more sense for you to see your life as offense than defense then you should continue doing so. my point is simply that defense in basketball is one lens through which i view the world. when i see an exceptionally beautiful or difficult defensive play pulled off, part of me watches in awe at how skilled professional athletes are, and another part of me thinks  that is the level of execution i aspire to reach in solving the problems in my life

In my dorm, East Campus, residents are allowed to paint the door to their room. Unlike murals on the walls, which generally have to be approved by the hall (or at least not objected to), your door is your own to do with as you like. Most doors have been painted and painted over who knows how many times, and  each one has a story, But when I moved into my room at the start of my sophomore year, the door was not only blank, it was raw, unpainted wood. I immediately resolved to paint it. I wanted what I put on it to be special, to reflect the fact that it was the first time the door had ever been painted. I thought about it on and off for all the fall semester, and sometime late in IAP, I hit on the idea of a translucent tree: the paint showing the wood behind it, the door’s real wood grain becoming the grain of the tree. The semester got going before I could get painting, so I resolved to paint the tree over spring break. Then… one week before spring break, the Exodus occurred. So there was no door painting for me that year. Or the next. This blog post is the story of how my door finally got painted! When I moved back into EC this fall, my senior fall, two full years later, I moved back into the same room. Time had only strengthened my resolve to paint my door. But there was a lot going on, because there’s always a lot going on. So I didn’t get started until winter break. My zeroth step was to clean my door. Even though it had never been painted, it had sure been stickered, nailed, dripped on, etc. I did my very best to remove the evidence of all of these activities, and I did make a lot of progress, but a lot of it was unremovable. I decided this was OK – I liked the idea that underneath what I did to my door, you would always be able to see what other people did to it when it was  door. Previous Next My first step was to make some sketches on my
 
iPad. ⁠ 01 During the pandemic, MIT loaned iPads to all the undergrads so that we could use them to complete psets and exams remotely. They were also super fun for drawing on!  experience (growth mindset!) and I needed to figure out a way to represent this that would look good with my limited abilities. After some trial and error, I settled on a geometric representation of a tree. Drawing real objects accurately is very difficult, but drawing straight lines is much easier. (Note that I did not say it is easy.) Previous Next With a plan in place, I resolved to finish my door by the end of IAP. And, well… I did at least start it! I walked to Central Square and bought the paint at Blick’s art store, a sentence which hides a significant amount of deliberation over the like seven kinds of acrylic paint you can buy at Blick’s. I decided to go with a middle of the road paint brand, not the cheapest but not even close to the nicest. I bought four colors: two shades of green, light and dark so I could mix them for the leaves, and brown and black so I could mix them for the trunk. The next step was to try out some color mixing. I also had to mix in water to make the paint transparent, so that added another degree of freedom. I tested out some options on the back of my door — mostly because I needed to know how they would look on actual treated wood, but I also liked the idea of future residents of my room being able to see my planning. So often, when you move into a room with a painted door, you know little or nothing about the story behind it; my tester leaves are like a tiny little clue to the process and desires that created my door. The numbers refer to the ratio of colors and water that I mixed to make each color. Once I had my ratios the way I liked them, I was ready to start with the door! For the main part of the trunk, the lines were long enough that I put down painter’s tape. This was a super finicky process, though, and I didn’t want to repeat it ten more times, so I freehanded the rest of the branches. You can definitely tell, but they still look OK. Although in an ideal world they would’ve looked nicer, I think this is good enough for the level of effort and time I had available. I also wish that in general, they had come out a bit more transparent. After the main trunk came out darker than I thought it would be, I tried to make each subsequent size of branch a little more transparent as a kind of fade-out, but I’m not sure how noticeable that ended up being. Next, I started the leaves. Because there were going to be so many of them, and because I wanted them all to look very similar to fit the geometric style I was going for, I made stencils. I made two, a big one and a small one. And then, uh, IAP ended and I didn’t do anything for a really long time because getting stuff done during the semester is hard. But as the semester wound down, I finally found time to start painting the leaves! I overlapped them, just as I had in the plan, with the goal of having the overlapping areas show up darker (just like real leaves do!). Although that didn’t work with every single overlap area, it worked with enough of them that I think you do get the overall effect I was going for. Previous Next Right when I thought I was done, I had an idea that wasn’t in my plan. At around the same time I was finishing up the leaves, it finally became spring on campus (something that never seems to happen until halfway into May, instead of March or April like you hope). And spring brought a proliferation of flowers! Previous Next When I saw the trees blossoming, I immediately knew I wanted to paint flowers on my tree as well. I liked the idea of creating a permanent reminder of such a beautiful but fleeting time on campus. I also liked the idea that future students might see my door from September through April and wonder what was going on with the flowers (especially since they’re so geometric that it’s not obvious what they are), until finally right at the end of the year it would all make sense, like a little secret in plain sight. Once all the painting was done, it was time for the very last step. When I was iterating through sketches at the very beginning I wasn’t sure if I wanted to put wood grain lines on my tree trunk — would it be overkill, would it look weird, would it be the perfect finishing touch? While I was cleaning all the stickers off the door, and coming to terms with the ones that remained, a phrase popped into my head:  . As soon as I thought of it, I knew that I wanted   to be the wood grain of my tree. All throughout working on this project, I collected words. Sharpie-ing them onto the trunk was the last step to completing the door. Previous Next Here’s the words that make up each line: . Inspired by the door itself, which was a tree, then wood,  and is now both; and whose layers of wear and tear are not hidden, but visible for everyone to see. . Inspired by my desire to spend more time in the way I did on this project, making art just because I wanted to. . Also somewhat inspired by the door’s wear and tear, but also by  the important-to-me realization . This comes from a  Jewish saying Overall, I’m happy with how my door came out. You can certainly tell I’m not the most experienced artist, but I almost like that — that you can look at this and think, a regular person made that just because they wanted to. I really enjoyed every step of the process: iterating on the idea to find the one that was just right; painting the door from the hallway and chatting with people who walked by; creating a brand-new idea from a messy mix of the canvas at hand, the environment around me, and my own brain. East Campus is getting renovated at the end of the next academic year, so this door will only be around for one year. But even if it were gone tomorrow, I’m glad I made it. And in the twelve months it will be here, I hope it’ll pique someone’s curiosity or bring them joy when they walk by. :)

I have two finals left as I write this,
 
3.091 ⁠ 01 Introduction to Solid State Chemistry. Satisfies the Chemistry GIR. 
7.014. ⁠ 02 Introductory Biology. Satisfies the Biology GIR. Looking back, I should’ve been kinder and gentler to myself instead of intimidating myself out of things so much. I shouldn’t have felt guilty when I needed to take a break. I shouldn’t have scared myself out of opportunities to meet new people and hang out with old friends, out of the fear that they won’t like me. It only left me feeling lonelier. A small part of me still says that I should’ve worked harder in my classes, even though I also know that I did the most that I could. I did what I thought was right then, and I shouldn’t put down my past self for not knowing what I know now. I try my best to be forgiving towards myself, but I still slip once in a while. I think for the most part, my freshman year was spent dismantling the mindsets that I held for granted back in high school. I stopped putting my own perfectionism on a pedestal anymore, especially after it and anxiety nearly left me incapacitated during a severe case of burnout in February and March. During spring break, I made sure to make more time for myself, and I managed to catch myself up in my classes. I made a huge comeback in all of my classes in the latter half of the semester. Even then, sometimes I feel like I haven’t changed enough. Sometimes, I feel like I changed too much. I’m drifting in this liminal space between the pre-college freshman and college freshman self where I’m not good enough to consider myself qualified of anything. I feel incomplete because these parts of me are moving in different directions. The incompleteness is uncomfortable and makes me feel ugly, like the way a bird is pretty and a baby bird is cute, but a fledgling looks like an awkward mashup of both but isn’t pretty or cute enough to be one or the other. But the fact that I’m thinking about all of this means that I’m   changing, right? Sometimes, you have to prune overgrown branches now to let new flowers bloom next season. The deconstruction of what I once thought was right doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m destroying myself, but more that I’m doing this to build myself in ways that I can’t predict now. I still have imposter syndrome, but oh well. No amount of achievement is going to soothe that as much as self-forgiveness will. But I think I can turn all of this into a good thing. I remember ninth grade leaving me dissatisfied and lonely, but I turned it into a source of motivation to make tenth grade better. I’m sure I can do the same for my sophomore year here.

if i had to write a literary analysis on my blog posts, i’d talk about how the strongest ongoing theme is coping with contradictory convictions. how can we believe two things that can’t both be true? how can we feel two opposite feelings? how can we both want and not want something? for example: confronting the self yeah, i’m turning twenty, it’s terrifying finding meaning at the end of the world lies in mit, lies about mit i (don’t) want the summer to end that last post, i (don’t) want the summer to end was, in my mind, the post that started this school year. so let me bookend this school year’s blog posts with some more contradictions. for one, i (don’t) want to do work. i want to get things done. i have projects i’m, in theory, excited about, like working on firehose, or making more write-ups about math, or writing this larp. and yet, all i want to do is play video games (like  slay the spire for another, i (don’t) want the semester to end. i mean, it’s true that i want the semester to be over, for my finals to be finished and for the grading to be done. but i don’t want to move out, i don’t want to start my summer internship, and i don’t want to say goodbye to the seniors. i don’t want to play the game of “is this the last time we’ll see each other?” whenever i talk to someone who’s graduating. and there’s the one i’ve been dealing with the most, these past few days. i (don’t) want to be alone. in  a season of secondhand joy i arrived in the room a few minutes before the show was slated to start. as i entered the lecture hall, i scanned the audience, looking for familiar faces. i picked out a few. they were all sitting with other people. i claimed an empty seat on the edge of the third row and scrolled through my phone. more and more seats get taken. the third row goes from just me, to another person near the middle, to three of their friends flanking them. i glance again at the audience. i was the only person seated alone. i felt heat rise from my stomach, into my arms, down the tips of my fingers. my chest felt lighter, as if a rope was wrapped around it and i was suspended in midair. the discomfort grew, and i walked out of the room before the concert even began. i take the back exit out. i pass through empty hallways, and let my eyes bounce from my phone, to the floor, to the ceiling, to the bulletin boards. i see posters of people, standing in groups, and smiling. posters advertising the concert i just walked out of. the gravity on my chest flips, and i feel weight stacked on my shoulders, as if someone was sitting on them. but no one was sitting on my shoulders. it was just me. it was always just me. i find myself in my room, not entirely remembering how i got there. i lie down on the couch, and feel the weight dissipate. i bury my head in a pillow and cry. the guilt of leaving the concert that night nibbled on my soul. i promised a friend who performed that i’d show up, and i didn’t. i sat there, in the third row of the audience, for several minutes. i saw my friend, the one i made a promise to, at the front of the hall, off by the side. i wasn’t sure if he saw me. our eyes crossed, but he didn’t acknowledge my presence, so maybe he never did notice me. i don’t know what’s worse. if he didn’t notice, he wouldn’t have seen me leave early. but if he did notice, i at least could’ve said i was there. it reminds me of how, sometimes, it doesn’t feel like i made any friends in mit. it’s a blatant lie, by any reasonable definition of “friend”. but some days i jump from one community to another without ever feeling like i fit in. i see people i’m acquainted with, people who appreciate me for what i do, but not people who would call me when they need help, nor people i felt comfortable calling when i need help. how could i feel  so welcomed here it reminds me of how, once, a friend invited me to a party he was hosting, and i didn’t know anyone else but him. he smiled when he saw me, said he was glad that i came, and i believed that. but the whole time, i felt out-of-place. i didn’t click with anyone else in that party. and it’s not like i was going to talk to my friend the whole time, because he was the host; he had to see to the other guests. and it’s not even his fault, as i’m pretty sure he invited some other people i knew, who weren’t able to come. it reminds me of the high school reunion i went to, a pool party, a year after i graduated. everyone was off in their groups. i spend my time floating from one group to another, trying to find a conversation i can relate to, or even one i felt like i could join in. after giving up, i walked to the far edge of the pool, sat down, and stared at the water. why did i leave the concert, that night? if it was because i didn’t want to be alone, then wasn’t locking myself in my room counterproductive? and if it was because i wanted to be alone, then wasn’t i already sitting alone? i guess it’s not about being alone, but about feeling lonely. there’s a difference, as i talked about in  dissecting emotion There’s the feeling of being in a group of people and not knowing anyone else. This is  , which I like to think of not on its own, but in contrast. If you’re in your room, that’s just being alone. If you’re walking through a crowded subway station, there’s just lots of people. But if you’re surrounded by people who are feeling connected with each other and you aren’t, that’s isolation. i don’t want to feel lonely. so in my mind, there’s two ways to deal with that. one is to surround myself with friends. the other is to go to my room. it happens that these solutions are, respectively, not being alone, and being alone. being alone is so, so much easier than finding friends. here’s another thought about loneliness. loneliness is defined  . if you’re alone, but have no one to compare it to, so you’re not lonely. if you’re in a crowded subway station, it’s not like there’s anyone to compare yourself to who’s having more fun than you are, so you’re not lonely. it’s only when you’re around people who are having fun, and you compare yourself to them, and realize you’re not having fun, that it hurts. that pain has a name, and it is loneliness. i’ve been thinking about this for years now. five years ago, i wrote: The worst feeling isn’t missing out, but having everything you ever wanted right in front of you, right there, and to be a bystander. The worst feeling is watching people have fun in front of you, without you. the worst feeling isn’t missing out, but the fear of missing out. in mit, like in any other university, things happen all the time. so i thought i’ve made peace with the fact that i’m going to miss things. but when i go to parties and see people talking and having fun; when i hear goodbye speeches written for graduating seniors; when i see big gestures from one lover to another; when i’m in my room and i hear the party from upstairs, downstairs, and hell, there’s one happening across my room, right now; when any of these things happen, it’s not that i wish i was a part of it. it’s that i wonder:  three years ago, the summer before my first-year fall, i wrote: Call it a belated answer. But when I think about what I   want out of the college experience, the answer is surprisingly simple: I don’t want more of the past. I don’t want to be reminded of the past. I don’t want more cliques to form without me in it. I don’t want to get left behind because everyone else has friend groups already. in this respect, i’ve failed. the past has never left, not that i should’ve expected a place like mit to magically make me feel better. because it was never about being in mit. it’s about  , isn’t it? there has to be   wrong with me, that i feel the same problems over and over and over again. but   it about me? when i talk to other people i know in mit, or in other places, a lot of them talk about the same things. maybe it’s a problem of perception, then? or maybe it’s the case that the people i know are also the kind of people who’d feel lonely, because if i knew people that didn’t feel lonely, then it’d be less likely for me to feel lonely as well. maybe it   about me, but it’s not something intrinsic. maybe it’s the depression talking, making me think i’m more alone than i actually am. maybe it’s another downward spiral i’m falling in, after  things have been going okay for a while following this eternal recurrence, i end the same way i begin. no answers, more questions. do i want to be alone? do i want to not be alone? how do i stop feeling lonely? i don’t know.

over spring break i met a grad student. we were talking about why they feel the need to work on impactful research, and after a while they said something along the lines of:  look at the sandwich you’re eating. you didn’t grow the lettuce or the wheat or the tomatoes, or crush the wheat into flour or cut the lettuce or tomatoes. you didn’t bring all the ingredients to the restaurant, and you didn’t cook any of them yourself. you didn’t design or construct the building or the cooking equipment. other people had to do all of those things for you you know how in ‘avatar’, whenever aang enters the avatar state we see all the past avatars? that’s what i see every time i look at the world. everywhere i look, i see the work of all the people who came before me, and how other humans were instrumental in designing and building and maintaining almost every aspect of our civilization you expect me to just work a chill tech/quant job and relax in my free time and not care about my impact on the world? you think i can just look at all the previous avatars and say “nope, sorry, this line of work ends with me and i’m not going to try to continue it”? maybe people not fully aware of the nature of the world can do that. but once you realize that everything you touch is the result of the backbreaking, soul-crushing labor of the humans that came before you, once you feel that knowledge in your bones and it becomes a lens through which you continuously process every experience, i don’t think it’s possible to say no to trying very hard to improve the world (said grad student was probably one of best people i’ve ever met at coming up with extended verbal arguments on the spot) that conversation happened over a month ago but it hasn’t really left my mind since. i think this is because the ideas the grad student expressed were at once very resonant and very troubling for me on one hand, i think i’d strongly prefer a world where more people kept an explicit goal of improving the world and used that as one of the primary criteria for making decisions like what job to work at after college. i think we’d be in a better place right now if that were the case, and i think my conversations with friends would be more interesting if they all had work they were passionate about. i’ve also  previously  explored and written about ideas related to reincarnation and everyone being the same person, so naturally i’d be attracted to the avatar metaphor on the other hand, i don’t really believe in obligation to the past, especially because obligation is often used to guilt or pressure people into specific behaviors, especially because that guilt or pressure often results in needless anxiety. that is not exactly the same as what happened in this scenario, since the grad student told me the avatar idea wasn’t stressing them out, but it’s a reservation i have against all arguments of this form i told all this to a friend, and they asked me how i’d want to resolve this discrepancy. at first i said i wanted a system to decide when to do things for myself (which might also be bad for the world) and when to do things for other people (which might also be unpleasant for myself), to which they pointed out the obvious – that i already have such a decision-making system, since for each action i already decide whether to take it or not. then i said there’s a part of me that wants to help myself and a part of me that wants to help others, and what i really want is a way of satisfying both parts of myself for a while i thought the way to go about this was to align the two objectives – i tried to push myself towards skills and projects and work that would be good for myself and good for the world. i don’t think that really worked out though (considering that at various points i worked for big tech and finance and crypto, all of which have somewhat dubious relationships with the world), and it was also a very constraining mindset to have but more importantly, aligning the two objectives doesn’t actually resolve the issue at hand. ultimately i don’t think the problem is actually that it’s difficult for me to find work that is good for myself and good for the world; the problem is that those two parts of me both feel the need to be attended to most of the time. i should be allowed to take turns focusing on one thing at a time without the other feeling neglected. i should be able to do selfish things for myself without feeling like i’m letting down the avatar and i should be able to do difficult things for other people without feeling like i’m ignoring my own needs. i think my inner selves should be kinder to each other, and i am trying to figure out how to make that happen

On the second last day of classes my freshman spring, I wrote  a blog post I think it’s pretty cool to see what’s changed and what hasn’t since that blog post almost exactly three years ago. The trees are all flowering just like they were, and the weather is sunny but chillier than May feels like it should be. I walked a little further this day than that one, but not by much. I was pretty hosed then and I’m pretty hosed now. My classes are all different, of course, and so much else is too. But ultimately, it kinda just feels like another day in the life. 9.50 am: My partner’s alarm goes off. I feel like I could sleep for a much longer time. I roll over to cuddle with them and go back to sleep instantly. 10.00 – 10.10 am: The snooze goes off. I feel, surprisingly, much more awake than I did 10 minutes ago. I checked my email and “social media” (by which I mean uh… Slack? Tumblr? let’s not talk about what that word means to me) and we chat a little bit. 10.10 am: I get out of bed to get ready (bathroom, brushing teeth, etc.). Making it out of bed in 20 minutes is unfortunately pretty good for me these days. 10.25 am: I gather up my stuff and walk back to my room to get dressed. My a cappella group, the Asymptones, had our end-of-semester concert yesterday evening, and there is a lively discussion in the chat about what else we still need to do before everyone leaves: pick our songs for next semester, hold elections, have a party, you know, all that crucial stuff. I text as I walk and try not to drop anything. 10.28 am: I check the weather and put on some clothes. It’s kind of mediocre outside right now; it’s supposed to start getting actually warm in a few days, which I hope comes true. I really need to do laundry, which means that all my usual shirts are gone: I have the option of choosing between my favorite shirts that I love too much to wear, or the ones I don’t actually like. Usually I would go with the latter, but since there’s only a few days left in the semester and I want to make them special, I put on my very favorite shirt instead. 10.35 – 10.54 am: I’m dressed with some time to spare. This is an unusual occurrence, caused by my surprising wakefulness when the snooze went off. I sit down to start this blog post (and multitask by texting the other Asymptones, who are still popping off in the chat). 10.54 am: I throw on a light jacket and head to class. This year my earliest class is at 11 every day, which means I usually skip breakfast: when lunch is just an hour away, there doesn’t really feel like a point to eating again. It’s actually much nicer outside than I expected! Although it is a little chilly, it’s sunny and it seems like everything has finally started to look green and spring-y. My view right after walking outside of the building. 11.02 am: I am actually
 
early ⁠ 01 We run on MIT time, which means that classes start five minutes after the hour and end five minutes before. That gives you ten minutes to get from one class to the next. 11.04 am: We’ve collected a small pile of students. We walk into the back of the room, but none of us have the courage to actually ask the previous class to leave. I notice an acquaintance in the room and we say hi. The professor realizes we are awkwardly lurking and gets the previous class to leave. 11.06 am – 12.26 pm: Our professor starts talking. It’s the last class of the semester (somehow. the passage of time shocks me) so instead of lecturing on a pre-set topic, he’s answering our questions. This class is 24.903, aka Semantics, aka how we know the meanings of sentences, and we talk about a whole bunch of interesting stuff. Some of the questions have easy answers, but a lot of the answers are “we don’t know yet but we’re working on it”, which I think is pretty cool. 12.26 pm: Class ends. I thank my professor for a good semester and leave. I have a 1 pm lunch meeting, but it’s also the day of Course 6’s monthly food truck event: any student majoring in EECS can line up to get free food. Usually I stick around afterwards to eat my food and hang out with my friends (which is pretty much the purpose of the event: to “build community”). Today, my plan is to just grab the food and put it in the fridge to eat for dinner later. 12.31 – 12.40 pm: I arrive at the food truck and the line is suuuper long. I’m a little nervous about making it to my 1 pm on time, but I get in line. Luckily, it moves faster than I expected and by 12.40 I’m walking away with a Bon Me box in hand. 12.42 pm: Living in EC is so freaking convenient. I quickly walk over from Hockfield Court and stick the food in my floor’s communal fridge. I actually don’t need to leave for my meeting yet (it’s at Maseeh, about an 8-10 minute walk away), and my phone is at 2% from all of that a cappella texting, so I sit in my room and charge it for a few minutes. 12.52 pm: Caragay and I head out from EC. Our lunch meeting is for DormCon, aka the Dormitory Council. We’re the outgoing president and vice president, and along with the incoming P & VP, we’re meeting with one of the dorm Heads of House to discuss a new initiative that DSL is hoping to implement for students. She’s also swiping us into Maseeh’s dining hall, which means we get free lunch. The day has only gotten more beautiful, so we take the outside route and walk along the river on the way to Maseeh. Standing in the EC courtyard right before leaving for Maseeh. Although I neglected to get a photo, the river is basically right at the end of this sidewalk — those tall buildings you can see in the very back are on the other side of the river. A particularly pretty bush we saw on the way to Maseeh. 1.02 – 2.28 pm: The Head of House swipes us in and we grab food. I thought it would be a relatively quick meeting, but it turns out we all have a lot of thoughts about the new initiative! We have a really good discussion, but I have to duck out early to get to my 2.30 pm class on time. 2.37 – 4.08 pm: I pull up to class slightly late (which has unfortunately become the norm for me). It’s 24.910, aka Morphology, aka how parts of words combine to make words. This semester, I’m taking two course 6 (electrical engineering & computer science) classes and two course 24 (linguistics) classes. I’m actually finished with my course 6 undergraduate major, so those two classes will count towards the master’s program I’ll be pursuing next year. The course 24 classes are to finish my linguistics minor for my undergraduate degree. It’s a quirk of my schedule that my 24 classes are both Mon/Wed and my 6 classes are both Tues/Thurs. As I sneak into the room (although to be honest it’s hard to sneak into an eight-person class), the two postdocs who teach the class are just finishing saying that we’re going to start by reviewing the midterm we took last week, and then they’re going to give us time to work on our final projects. I’m extremely relieved, because a) my project is nowhere near done b) I have a lot of questions I want to ask them about how to do it. Over the course of the 90-minute class, I make a lot of progress on the project. It’s an analysis of a morphological problem in a language I don’t know, and I’m happy to hear that the teachers think my analysis plan is worth pursuing. (Even if I feel a little bad that I’m asking them for feedback on my analysis plan when the full explanation of how I pursued it is due tomorrow at midnight. Oops.) At the end of class, we get our midterms back, and I did a lot better than I expected! I thank the teachers for a good semester and leave with a spring in my step. My view right after exiting class. It was so sunny! This outdoor path is parallel to the Infinite Corridor, so we usually call it the Outfinite. 4.08 pm: I’m on my way to hang out with a friend in the Rainbow Lounge, but first I want to stop by the glassblowing lab (in the basement of building 4) to pick up the piece that I made last week. To work with glass and shape it, it has to be extremely hot: between one and two  degrees Fahrenheit. Cooling a finished piece down to room temperature immediately would put a ton of stress on its internal structure, and cause it to break or even explode. So instead, finished pieces are brought down to room temp slowly over the course of 24 hours in an annealer, and glass lab students can drop by anytime the next day or later to get their work. This was my last piece for this semester, and I’m super pleased with how it turned out. My piece! It’s a flower vase. 4.19 – 5.05 pm: I arrive at the Rainbow Lounge in Building 50. It’s a beautiful space on the second floor, and the sun is low enough in the sky that the room is filled with light. We have a nice time chatting, but both have to head out at 5 because we are hosed, me with final projects and my friend with studying for finals. 5.05 – 5.40 pm: That hangout was my last official commitment for the day, so now I am free! I leave Building 50 fully intending to go to my room and work on my final projects, but I spot a group of my friends hanging out in the EC courtyard. It’s a delightful mix of people who I saw just yesterday and who I haven’t seen in a couple weeks, so I walk over to say hello. And, oops, of course I end up saying a lot of other things too. We hang around and talk for a while, and although we’re all supposed to be doing work, this is just so much nicer. 5.40 pm: Everyone I’m talking to lives in the East Parallel, so I follow them up the stairs, where I end up on Slugfest with Caragay. We eat a snack! Then Caragay has a meeting that doesn’t involve me (unbelieveable! so rude /s) so I leave to go back to my room and get some stuff done. 5.50 – 6.39 pm: I settle down on my couch and update this blog. I definitely intended to do some other things as well, but they do not happen. It turns out documenting everything you do, as you do it, takes quite a bit of time. Who could’ve guessed? 6.39 – 7.08 pm: Caragay comes back and we eat dinner together on Slugfest, before splitting up again to go get our respective forms of exercise (Taekwondo and weightlifting). I actually decide that I want to get a bit of work done first, so I don’t have to worry about it the whole time I’m lifting. 7.08 – 7.57 pm: I get back to this blog, bring it up to date, and start uploading and arranging all my photos. 7.57 – 8.37 pm: I’m finally up to date on the blog, so I switch to working on one of my final projects. This is for one of my course 6 classes, for which Caragay and I are partnering on a group project. We’re all done with the project itself, but we have to turn in a very extensive writeup all about everything we did. The paper is currently at 8 pages and we have a good bit left to write. 8.37 pm: My computer is about to die and I’m tired of writing. That means it’s time for exercise! I haven’t exercised in more than a month due to getting several illnesses in a row. I’m really excited to get back to it, but definitely a little nervous, too, because it’s been so long. On my way to my room, I remember that I also need to do laundry — and the laundry room is right next to the gym in the EC basement, how convenient! 8.37 – 9:00 pm: I get my laundry ready and toss it in. 9:00 – 9:34 pm: Workout time! I feel so happy to be back on the grind. I keep it lighter than usual since I want to ease myself back into it, and  feel like a flat pancake when I wake up tomorrow. 9.34 – 9.36 pm: Campus laundry machines take 36 minutes to run a load, and my workout was 34 minutes. This serendipity delights me for the entirety of the two minutes I spend waiting for the laundry machine to finish. 9.36 – 9.52 pm: I hang up the parts of my laundry that need to hang dry and jump into the shower. 9.52 – 10.58 pm: I head back to Slugfest and Caragay and I almost finish our project writeup. It’s due
 
tomorrow ⁠ 02 Notice a theme? Tomorrow is the last day anything can be due, which means tomorrow is the day <em>everything</em> is due. 10.58 – 11.20 pm: Slugfest has cocoa every school night at 11 pm. Since this is the second last day of school, it’s the last school night and therefore the last cocoa! Caragay and I reach a nice stopping point right before cocoa and agree that it seems like the perfect study break. We go to the lounge and chat with people for a while. 11.20 – 11.27 pm: I zip over to the laundry room real quick to grab my finished laundry. 11.27 pm – 12.31 am: I head back to Caragay’s room and finish this blog post. 12.31 am: It’s bedtime! It always takes me a while to get ready for bed and fall asleep, but I don’t have class until 11 so I have plenty of time to get some good rest. I have one final project almost done and one about half done. Both are due tomorrow, and maybe this should worry me more than it does… but if I’ve learned one thing in my eight semesters at MIT, it’s that things always work out in the end. I go to sleep with a happy heart. #A Day In The Life Of

the hours i’ve spent in bed recently have added up, pointing to one conclusion: actually, i only recently discovered that i’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression since late december. here’s how that went: during my last therapy session, i asked my therapist about how i can go about getting an official depression diagnosis. this was because mit’s covid cases have been…
  high lately ⁠ 01 ring delivery also happened recently for the class of 2024, and i swear all the sophomores were dropping like flies afterwards covid dashboard anyway, every day i’d wake up to a new message from someone saying they tested positive, and when i developed a sore throat on the last wednesday of april, i could almost feel covid looming threateningly over me. it turns out it  wasn’t covid crucially, if you are considered a high risk person (which: do you have depression, ADHD, or other mental health problems? is your BMI over 25? have you ever smoked?), you immediately qualify for Paxlovid (the best antiviral treatment we have), but you have to begin treatment within a few days of symptom onset / a positive test “huh,” i said. “well, i’m probably depressed, but i’d need that on some official record if i got covid and wanted to get paxlovid.” when i brought it up to my therapist, she seemed a little taken aback. “oh, i already diagnosed you with depression the first couple of times we met,” she said. “i think it should be on your chart? maybe you just can’t see it.” sure enough, when i went poking around on
 
healthelife ⁠ 02 the appointment scheduling platform that mit medical uses my reaction: i thought i’d been self-diagnosing depression this WHOLE TIME, and you’re telling me i’ve actually been going to therapy specifically for depression for FIVE MONTHS?? clown moment. in any case, depressive episodes come and go, and this latest one has been hitting me pretty hard. getting sick definitely didn’t help. my sore throat made it hurt to swallow and when it started migrating up my sinuses, affecting my nose and inducing pain in my ears, it was difficult to fall asleep. and i wasn’t going to classes because i obviously didn’t want to get people sick, but that made me fall behind even more, and now i have a crap ton of lectures and assignments to catch up on. i couldn’t work on them while i was sick, either, because just breathing was a chore. you know that feeling when one side of your nose is clogged and the other side feels like the sahara desert? yeah. i’m no longer sick, but i’m still feeling some of the mental and physical aftereffects. namely, it’s been   hard to drag myself out of bed. and even when i spend time in bed, i’m not necessarily resting–my sleep schedule is all messed up right now. i go to bed at like, 3 or 4 and wake up at 12, which is still a decent amount of sleep, but that’s because i’m not going to lectures, and even though i feel well-rested when i wake up, there’s this bone-deep exhaustion that prevents me from being productive. it’s the end of the semester, too, which means i don’t really have   much work left to do, but the fact that i’m almost done more often than not makes me feel like it’s pointless to put a lot of effort into things, and summoning up the energy to finish things off strong has been hard. i think the fact that i’m writing this post means things are getting a little better, though. this beats sitting at my desk staring into space and experiencing Thoughts™. the Thoughts™ typically consist of the following: let’s dissect A and B a little more. A: i believe that one of my biggest points of pain this year comes from the fact that my social circles have gone through a lot of changes–and some of those changes really hurt. i thought i would remain close friends with certain people, and now we’re not as close as we used to be. some of those separations happened naturally as we drifted apart, general hosage and physical distance pushing us away from the shores of each other. others happened more abruptly. all of them had a pretty big impact on me. if you look at my posts from this year, you can see me dancing around this topic, never explicitly talking about what happened but finding ways to express my grief anyway. and as a result i think i have accumulated issues with letting people in and trusting them because now my brain is wired all wrong. (what if they leave? what if we leave each other? what if they replace me? what if they no longer need me?) i’m a high maintenance machine. (what if they see me and all of my insecurities and fears and they decide that’s too much?) but also, sometimes, you let people in and they don’t leave. sometimes you let people in and they see all of you, all of your insecurities and fears and your barely-suppressed belief that deep down inside, you’re a monster, and they still don’t leave. this is hard to understand. you’ve shown them the worst parts of you, so why are they still here? and the answer is: you are not as unlovable as you think you are. your flaws are not as unforgivable as you think they are. and people are always allowed to leave, and some people are always going to leave, and that’s  . it just means that maybe your friendship has ran its course and you’ve outgrown each other. but if they’re the right person, they’re not going to leave. this is what i have been trying to internalize recently. i’ve been relearning how to let people approach me instead of always keeping my guards up. B: alright, so maybe it’s the depression talking, but i feel like i’ve given up on interests and hobbies that used to make me happy. i don’t know–i think it’s a function of the fact that i always used to have some sort of media that i was obsessed with and clearly brought me a lot of joy. for a while it was chinese webnovels, and then it was my hero academia, and then i got really into creating original characters for a while. but recently, it’s been…nothing? i mean, i’ve been watching tv shows and stuff–heartstopper was really good–but nothing has really caught my interest the way it used to. that’s kind of because i got busy with school and trying to balance other real life commitments, but it is really strange not having any comfort media to return to. actually, that’s not true. i think that, instead of fictional media, i’ve just started relying on music and spotify playlists a lot more to cope with things. but it just sucks because i even stopped drawing. doing art was such a huge part of my personality for years, and i haven’t touched my pen to draw anything for myself in months. i’ve been thinking about picking it up again but a part of me is afraid that i’ve lost the ability to draw and that everything will come out fucked up and wonky. because, you know, art is a skill you have to hone through practice, which is not something i’ve been doing. and you know what? i started thinking about all of this because i was on facetime with my friend ryan from high school who i haven’t talked to in a while, and he asked, “so what have you been up to? like i don’t know, what are your recent hobbies and interests and stuff?” and it took me forever to come up with an answer. i guess i’ve been really into cooking and baking, but the more i think about it…that’s kind of it. which is a little scary, because as much as i like that stuff…there’s got to be more, right? so why can’t i think of anything? why do certain things no longer make me happy? but i guess that’s also something that’s  . things don’t have to make me happy forever and maybe they’ll make me happy again in the future. i think a key realization is that the more i think about it, i really don’t miss who i was. i think this year, i’ve spent way too much time trying to cling to the past, dwelling in it, trying to keep things the same, but also change is… . and i don’t like everything about myself right now, but i don’t necessarily want to go back to the way things were. we move forward, not backwards. and it will be  .

A few weeks ago I did an interview with the  podcast hosted by our friends at  Art of Problem Solving just posted very long time It will be unsurprising to longtime readers, therefore, that my to the question of what we look for is the kind of thing you can read on our “ What we look for don’t try Many of  listeners are homeschoolers/unschoolers/nontraditionally educated students, so you’ll hear/see some references to that path, but hopefully there will be something in here for all readers of the blogs. Eric Olsen, the host, agreed to let me reproduce the audio (immediately below) and the transcript (immediately below that) here on the blogs. ‍ : On today’s episode, Chris Peterson, Director of Special Projects at MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services talks about what MIT looks for when they’re reviewing college applications, how the pandemic has affected their decision process and next steps advice for having an MIT-friendly application. What does MIT look for when you’re reviewing college applications and trying to put together a freshman class? : I think we look for a couple of different things. One thing is we’re looking for a baseline of academic preparation. We need to be really confident that you can come in the door and that you’re ready for MIT’s really challenging, fast-paced core curriculum in math and science and in humanities, arts, and social sciences. Because once you get over that bar, there’s a significant amount of autonomy at MIT in order to be able to choose your own educational adventure. But everybody, whether you’re majoring in astronomy or anthropology, is going to have to take physics and cal and bio and chem and intensive communication courses. That’s the first thing. That’s test scores, that’s curriculum, that’s grades. But it’s also, and this is the second part of the equation, your non-cognitive indicators. It’s your curiosity, it’s your initiative, it’s your resilience, it’s your ability to take feedback, it’s your ability to respond, and when things don’t go according to plan, your adaptability. Your ability to reach out for resources rather than have them be brought to you. And then last thing, and this is the thing that’s the hardest to communicate, and it’s the thing that surprised me the most when I became an admissions officer and saw what it was like from this side of the desk. The rest of it is the class. We’re building a team. And I know that’s such a cliche and nonspecific thing to say, but anyone who’s ever been a coach or manager or in charge of any group of people trying to succeed at challenging tasks knows you need different skills and different attributes, different ways of thinking, different ways of doing things. And the college admissions decision of any given applicant is overdetermined by everybody else in the pool, everybody who’s already at MIT, and everything else that we’re bringing into the class. And that’s the hardest thing emotionally is that every MIT admissions decision is not entirely about you. It is about you, it’s about your grades and your scores and your essays and your fit for MIT and your everything else. But it is, in some fundamental and unavoidable way, about other people. And that’s not something you can control. And so that part of letting go of the educational trajectory and realizing that there is some quanta that exists outside of your locus of influence is really important to understand, even as it’s really hard to accept. : How did the pandemic affect your admission decisions over the past two years? What changed? : Well, like many things over the last couple of years, in some respects, nothing changed and in some respects, everything changed. So the things that didn’t change were we looked at every applicant and we said, we have to be absolutely confident that you can do well here and we have to be confident that MIT is the right place for you. And what changed was the kinds of data that we had to make those decisions. We didn’t have test scores for everybody, but there were other things we could look at. Strength of curriculum, the content of that curriculum, tests in other areas, other academic indicators that our research shows can predict preparation for MIT. We had all sorts of different schooling systems, hybrid, online, offline, virtual. People switching to traditional non-traditional education for a year and then switching back into a traditional school. People exiting traditional education entirely. So it was a lot to make sense of all of that change, but in some respect, we were guided by the shibboleth of: are you prepared for MIT and is the MIT the right place for you? And those things steadied us through all the various eddies and the currents. : You teased this a little, but yeah, just this week, MIT announced you will be reinstating the SAT ACT requirement that you removed during the pandemic, because like you mentioned, live testing was very difficult for students, whereas many institutions are permanently dropping that requirement. They’re moving to test optional admissions, because for many of these institutions, they couldn’t find a strong correlation between those test scores and academic preparation for their institution. Many found GPA to be a stronger correlator, but that wasn’t the case at MIT. : That’s right. So as we just announced, you can go and read it yourself on MITadmissions.org. We have reinstated our long standing SAT ACT requirement for future admission cycles. And the first thing that I want to say is, as you mentioned, is that this was driven by research specific to MIT. We have an in-house research and analysis team led by someone with a PhD in educational assessment. We look very carefully at all different kinds of outcomes and all different kinds of inputs. What we found is we don’t need SAT and ACT scores for everybody, but we do need SAT and ACT scores for those students who might not have other ways to demonstrate their preparation, typically because their schools offer more limited coursework, or the students are not tracked in such a way, or the courses that may be notionally available at their school, that they’re not able to take them. And that’s not everybody in our pool. We could admit a class to MIT without requiring the SAT and ACT. But what we found is that it is the students who are sort of most disadvantaged, have the least educational capital, the fewest resources available to them, that tend to need the testing to demonstrate that preparation the most. And so we decided to design from that margin into the center of our system in terms of what we asked all of our applicants submit. Now, I will say a couple of things. One, a listener might reasonably ask, well, why can’t you just make the on ramp to MIT easier or more accessible if you need all this extra information? And the answer is that we do do quite a bit. We have great tutoring programs, we have a summer bridge program. All of our research here essentially takes those tutoring and bridge and other acclimation programs into account when we look at what we think a student needs. The second thing is that all of our decisions are very individuated. So we have this broad research about broad statistical trends with different things that we can measure, but those are only informing what come down to be deeply individual decisions that involve looking closely at everything else in the file. So it’s just that other additional piece of information that really helps us out. And the last thing I want to say is that we know that some students still won’t be able to take the exams. That could be because they can’t find a way to do so safely with the pandemic that is still going on. It could be because they live in a part of the country or the world that has military conflicts, political unrest. We’ve always kept the door open for students whose applications were interrupted by disasters and disruptions, and promised them a full and fair review. And we’re going to have a spot on the application as we have had in the past where students can explain anything in their application that’s a requirement where they weren’t able to complete it, why they weren’t and how we should take that into account for our full holistic review. The goal of the requirement is really to communicate that expectation. It is precisely because so many schools are adopting a test optional framework that students see as neutral that we thought we should bring our requirement back, because we do have an opinion. It is better for our ability to assess your application if you take the standardized tests, and if you take them, to send the scores to us. And so we wanted to frame that expectation as a requirement because that is what people can understand, particularly those again with the least access to educational resources. But we are very fair minded and understanding about other kinds of barriers that may prevent people from being able to sit for the tests, particularly with everything going on in the world right now. And we do commit to a full and fair review for all of those students, keeping in mind the north star of demonstrating preparation for MIT. : You mentioned one of the trends you saw these past two years was students who left traditional education for a year came back. Some left, stay leaving and are now applying to college. Do homeschoolers have a harder time getting into MIT? If I’m considering at home or hybrid schooling for my student, do I need to take seriously any impact that choice could have on their college admission chances? : I think that every parent and student needs to do what is the right thing for them. And I know that’s just an incredibly generic answer, but for my entire career, I’ve been telling people that if you’re building your educational trajectory around the chance to get into an institution that last year had a 4% admit rate, you’re buying a lottery ticket that you’re probably not going to win. And so, I understand that people want to build around MIT, either because it’s a prestigious institution or because they genuinely think that it’s the best place for their child to be educated or both. ‍ : But my advice has always been, don’t build you or your child’s educational trajectory around trying to get into MIT or Harvard or Stanford or any other super selective institution. Find the things that they’re passionate about, find the things that they’re curious about. Let them pursue their own unique interests and aptitudes as far as it will take them. That will make them the most distinguished standout college applicant that they can be and it will also not leave them with major regrets about how they might have otherwise spent their time should their desire not come to pass. : Maybe not even specific suggestions, but maybe specific examples. If getting into a institution like MIT is a goal for a student, for their family, what could should they focus on during their elementary and secondary years that would help them to be distinguished to stand out? ‍ : Well, I would focus maybe a little bit on some of the preparation questions and that’s how I would tie these two things together, which is to say, I stand by my claim that students shouldn’t spend their high school, whether it’s traditionally educated or untraditionally educated, in a traditional school or an untraditional school, trying to get them into MIT. However, it is certainly the case that students who we admit have had a really strong foundation in classic math and science, calculus, physics, biology, and chemistry with at least some exposure. But what I would say is that this is also a good test for whether or not somebody might be happy at MIT, because if you’re listening to this right now as a student or as the parent of a student, and you’re your heart sinks a little bit and you say, oh God, I’m not a big fan of physics. Well then, you should not be applying to MIT. It is a place where every student, no matter the major, has to do or get credit for at least two semesters of physics and then you’re doing a bunch of other quantitative and analytical work. So using the requirements of a school, using their tendencies, their core curriculum, the way that they build an education as trying to have a sense of, as the Ignatians would put it, does this fill you with joy or despair when you contemplate what you would have to do to set yourself up to be prepared for a school, might be a really good signpost as to whether or not it would actually be a good fit for you.  You mentioned the 96% rejection rate. All of our hearts dropped. Chris, what if my student who’s been counting, who’s been planning on this life, doesn’t get in? Is life over for them? Are they destined to a life of destitution?  Well, right, your tone indicates that you expect me to say they are not and that’s what I’m going to say. And I hope that’s not surprising to any of your listeners. But I do actually want to tell you a quick story and I’ll send you this link, Eric, so you can include it, hopefully in the materials. One thing that I’m really, really, really grateful for and proud of is that every year, when we release our decisions, we open some open threads on our blogs for students who were admitted, students who were wait listed, and students who were denied. And we have a lot of conversations in the open comments threads on those blog posts. And many students are disappointed, most of them, and many of them will comment feeling the way that you just described. And me and our other staff and bloggers will all encourage them and tell them, see how things go, and let us know how they turn out. And over the years, I’ve been doing this long enough now where over the years, I will just get emails one day from a student who’s just finished up their undergrad at another university, or just got into MIT for grad school, or did whatever it is that they’re doing. And they say, okay, yeah. Five years ago you were right. And sometimes I will take, with their permission, I will take those emails and I will turn them into blog posts. So I’ll send you a link. We have a whole series of blogs called  Denied by MIT X Years Later  That’s lovely. Chris, finally leave us with some next steps advice for parents and families who are looking to at least put their best foot forward. They want to make sure their student has at least an MIT friendly application package someday. How should they think about that journey? Well, as I said earlier, the biggest thing is making sure that your student or the student yourself, if you’re listening, should have a really strong foundation in math and science and also should be able to handle our communication intensive courses as well. And not only handle both of these things, but actually feel like they are things that they want to do. And other than that, I will always just put out a general plug for parents to nurture the unique interests and aptitudes of their students. For the audience listening to this podcast, I doubt that is a surprise. That’s probably why you’ve chosen some of the path that you’re on. But I borrow that language from the  1949 Committee on Education Survey Because right after World War II, you have all of these well funded research universities. You have the GI Bill, you have all these colleges and MIT sat down and wrote a report and said, well, why do we even exist? What is the point of this place? And what the people who wrote that report said is that MIT exists as a place to nurture the unique interest and aptitudes of students who could not otherwise find a place where they could pursue those things to the fullest. And so setting your students up to be in the habit of thinking about those things and pursuing them is, again, going to be the best thing for them and also the thing that will be the best thing for their MIT application. : It’s now time for our rapid fire segment called Problem Solved where we ask the guest to solve incredibly complex and difficult education issues in single soundbites. Chris, what’s one thing about K-12 education you wish you could snap your fingers and problem solved, it’s fixed? : So I would like every student to have an opportunity to do the thing that I had at my strange progressive public Vermont middle school, which was the ability to wander down to the library without a pass whenever I wanted and read whatever I wanted for however long I wanted and come back, and for no one to think that was delinquency or truancy or otherwise bad behavior. I was extremely privileged to attend that kind of school and to have the kind of teachers that I had. And when I go back to many schools today on the road, and I remember that at most schools, you have to have a pass just to go use the restroom. I’m reminded that most students don’t have that kind of liberty. And so if you can imagine a world where I can snap my fingers and somehow mass hypnotize every administrator in the country to allow that, that’s what I think I would do. : That’s a good one. If you could go back and give your kid-self advice on their educational journey, what would it be? : I would have told them how creative math can be, because I did end up, one reason I was wandering down the library all the time was because I was, most of my math education in my K-12 years was working through multiplication tables, which just bored me. And it probably wasn’t until I got to MIT, having avoided anything quantitative along the way in my high school and college years, that some of my MIT friends told me about how beautiful and creative math could be. And I think that had I just been lucky enough to stumble across the right book in that library, I might have realized that earlier, but that is the one thing where if I could go back and grab my tiny little 11 year old lapels and shake me, that’s what I would say. : I got to go plant some AoPS books in some public libraries across the country. What part of education do you think or hope looks the most different 10 years from now? : Over the last 10 years, one of the things that has really caused me to pull out the hair that I no longer have is the schism between online and offline education. We’ve kind of passed the MOOC buzz hype moment, thank God. But it always frustrated me that there weren’t more efforts to take the upsides of online education. The ability to learn things, taught by people all over the world and more subjects than you could count, with the social and educational institutions offered by a residential education, whether that’s at the university level or at the high school or at the K-12 level. I hope that in 10 years we have figured out a way to take that content delivery aspect of what the internet enables and the parasocial online communities that AOPS and lots of other places have cultivated while also embedding that in the local physical community of learners in all sorts of settings. And what’s your best advice for parents looking to raise future problem solvers? : I mean, this is kind of my answer about interest and aptitudes, but I would say just figuring out what makes your kid as curious as possible and keeping that curiosity alive. I think there can be a bit of a trend or desire, particularly when people think about accomplishments that they think colleges might be looking for, to just kind of drill and drill and drill and drill and drill and drill. And that is not going to work in terms of keeping some sort of sustained lifelong past the point of your admission to college, if it even lasts that long, focus on problem solving, just from the students that I’ve seen and from people that I’ve known, finding that just authentic curiosity. The thing that when your kid starts talking about, they just won’t shut up. Finding and cultivating that and then helping to direct it in many different areas, I think is the key. : I got to figure out how to direct my kid’s Encanto soundtrack obsession now. : Well, I was going to say, as soon as I started answering, I was like, I’m breaking the cardinal rule of non-parents, which is never tell parents how to be a parent. So please everybody who’s listening, please accept my heartfelt apologies for breaking that rule and know that Eric has me attached to all sorts of electrodes, forcing me to answer these questions as stated. But if we’re imagining the world that you’ve asked my advice, that is the best that I can provide. ‍ I think everyone who’s listening is looking to steal off other parents’ curves. We want to know what other parents have found out, schools have found out and copy it. And listeners, we’d love to hear your answers as well. So email us at  [email protected] Chris, thanks so much for joining us today. : Absolutely, Eric. Happy to be with you all. ‍ : I know Chris talked about the lottery ticket odds of MIT, but shoot, it kind of made me want my kids to go there even more, didn’t it? But let me take the rest of his advice to heart because there is so much about college admissions decisions that are out of our control. So what is in our control? Encouraging our students to chase their curiosities and empowering their passions, and also reminding them of the great school right down the street so they can live with us forever, am I right? And may you continue your journey alongside us, raising the great problem solvers of the next generation. See you next week.

until this year, I’d never really experienced loss or old age firsthand. my relatives who have passed away did so before I was born, or when I was too young to have any conception of what death is. more so, most of my extended family lives in India, so being raised in Nashua, New Hampshire meant that the experience of old age was far beyond my perception. however, in the past few weeks, I’ve been confronted with more and more evidence that life is, indeed, inexorable. the weekend before classes started, my host grandfather passed away, and two weeks ago, my cat was put to sleep. I met my host grandfather in my freshman year of high school, when I visited Japan on exchange for the first time. he lived right next to my host family’s house, so I’d visit him and my grandmother whenever my host parents and siblings weren’t home. he was always cheerful, lighthearted, and brimming with stories from his many travels. he taught me how to play shogi and how to tend to his garden, and he took me all over Nara to show me his favorite sights. I visited my host family every time I went to Japan⁠—which was every year of high school. the second and third visits were brief yet blissful, and one the fourth one, I brought my mom along. she got to spent a few days with my entire host family, which was an insane crossover. this was after I got into MIT, so I brought a lifetime supply of MIT merch for everyone. since my host sister had visited me in 2017 and Nisha had given her a MIT tour, they were all very appreciative. ojiichan wearing the mit hat i bought him two days before the spring semester started, I found out that my grandfather passed via an Instagram DM from my host sister. it felt like such a ridiculous way to receive such monumental news that I read and reread the message dozens of times, praying that my Japanese speaking capabilities had degraded to such an extent that I simply wasn’t interpreting it correctly. I later learned that it was due to cancer that he developed less than a year ago. I had no idea that he was ill—every interaction I’d had with my host family had been completely normal. I felt immense guilt for not checking in on my grandparents and assuming that everything was fine, and I grappled with the fact that I wasn’t able to even speak to him over video call before he passed. I’m sure my host family didn’t inform me for a myriad of reasons, but I so desperately wished I’d been aware. the funeral proceedings happened so fast. my host sister FaceTimed me into the ceremony and showed me his body, which was jarring on a level I’d never previously experienced. she sent me videos from his funeral collage, which included several pictures of me with him. I cried a lot. I spent the first few days of the semester researching Japanese funeral practices and asking my Japanese friends how I could best support my family from afar. I decided on sending them incense and a condolence bouquet that they offered to his altar. it was a small gesture, but I felt better when I saw the pictures of the flowers next to the photo of my grandfather. it was a rough start to the semester. since my psets are due biweekly, my workload in the first week wasn’t bad, and cramming my day with problems helped take my mind off of what happened. the unfortunate events didn’t end, though. the week of spring break, I found out that Flora, my cat, was sick.  we thought it was a UTI, but it turned out to be something much more insidious since her condition worsened rapidly. on April 3rd, my mom came to visit me at MIT and informed me that she and my dad had decided to put Flora down. I was distraught. I’m allergic to cats, so out of my family, I spent the least time with Flora. even still, the news caused me immense grief, and witnessing my mom in such a inconsolable state was gut-wrenching. I immediately sought comfort from one of my close friends, who had dealt with the same situation a few weeks prior. he and several other friends in my living community and clubs helped talk me through my grief and offer me advice on how to best approach this. with my friends’ advice, I spoke with S^3 for the first time in several months. I visited their virtual office hours and started crying instantly, so convincing the dean that I needed extensions on my work wasn’t difficult in the slightest. my experience with the dean was great; he comforted me and related with me while pointing me to resources and explaining how to receive help from professors. one of my classes doesn’t offer extensions—even when I was sick earlier in the semester and asked for a few-day extension, I had simply been directed to their late policy. with S^3’s help, I got a few extra days for a ‘family emergency.’ we got Flora in 2011, when she was about two years old. she was shy and afraid of us, so I—in typical dumb 10-year old fashion—would drag her out from her spot behind the toilet and try to force her to play with me. over time, she was desensitized to my ruthless attempts to make her socialize, and she began leaving her room of her own volition. in no time, she was a precious member of the family. returning home and seeing Flora in her new, defeated state was heartbreaking. she wouldn’t play with me no matter hard I tried—she was in a lot of pain, so we were giving her sedatives. she seemed like she had a permanent grimace on her face and her fur was scruffy and unkempt for the first time. she just wasn’t how I remembered. I had seen her mere weeks ago, but her condition had changed so fast. I hated myself for not playing with her more when I had the chance. it was absolutely brutal to see her trudging around the house instead of running around like she used to. sometimes, she couldn’t even walk; every time she had a bout of pain, my mom would carry her around the house like a baby, and she’d rest her head on my mom’s shoulder, rendered immobile. putting a pet down is a decision that’s awful beyond comprehension. I wasn’t directly involved in making it, so I was spared the feelings of guilt it induced, but god. every time I looked at Flora, I felt ill. reading about the procedure made me so nauseated I couldn’t breathe. on some days, Flora seemed normal, which made the thought of what was to come even harder, but reminding myself how much pain she was in helped assuage me that this was the right decision. Nisha started making a photo album and my mom ordered a small wooden box to put her ashes in. the concept made me sick to my stomach, but I agreed to paint it and attach a picture of all of us with her to the top. I painted flowers in honor of her name and added some pawprints leading to the lock that opened the box. making my beloved pet’s urn before she even passed was brutal beyond belief. painting those pawprints fucked me up lilacs since they reminded me of her, and because they grow in my backyard I didn’t cope well. I cried every couple of hours, or however often I looked at my mom’s face. making a sad playlist was about all I could do to process what was happening. on Thursday afternoon, I returned to MIT for CPW. I’m CPW chair and was hosting a few events, so I couldn’t afford to miss anything. leaving my home in its somber state to go be energetic in front of hundreds of prefrosh wasn’t optimal, but there was nothing else I could do. I put my all into the three days, compartmentalizing my emotions so I could be present for the prefrosh and all the friends helping me run events. early Sunday morning, I took a bus back to New Hampshire to be with everyone for Flora’s last day. the procedure was on Monday. it was a beautiful, cloudless day, which felt like a sick joke. I spent the morning sitting with Flora, but looking at her face and knowing what would happen in a few hours was nauseating. seeing my mom’s desperate attempts to get her to eat didn’t help either. we put her favorite toys in the box and took her to the vet. as soon as I stepped in the room where she would be put down, I felt an overwhelming hopelessness; the horrific nature of my reality started to seep into my consciousness. we spent half an hour with Flora, taking turns holding her and stroking her head, combing her with her favorite brush and whispering to her gently. I wiped my mom’s eyes and nose for her since her hands were busy holding Flora. the procedure itself was so swift that I could barely wrap my head around what had happened. the medicine was administered so quickly that it was done before I could even register the last image of her in my brain. we laid her on her side, and if it weren’t for her tongue sticking out of her mouth, she would look like she was asleep. I’ve never witnessed my parents and sister grieving so much. it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever experienced. it was worse knowing that they were feeling more pain than me since they had spent much more time with her. she was initially my sister’s cat, but she was the constant companion of my parents, and such a valuable part of their lives after my sister and I left for college. Flora was such a loved cat. without a doubt, she got as much love as we could’ve given her. I feel so lucky to have had her in my life, and I know how much joy she brought every member of my family. losing a pet is never easy, but I’m fortunate to have been able to be with my family as it happened. it’s been a rocky couple of weeks, but returning to MIT and spending time with my friends has helped. there have been a lot of fun events, including my birthday, that have taken my mind off what’s happened. I’m very grateful. RIP Florey <3

CW: Sexual Assault, Abusive Relationships, Suicidal Ideation, Non-Descriptive Mentions of Homophobia, and Discussion of Trauma ((Some Author’s Commentary.)) This has been one of the harder admissions posts for me to make, but one that I’ve been thinking about writing for a while. I listened to  Silvana Estrada’s “Si Me Matan”  for the majority of writing this post, which is a song about femicide in Mexico.  Here are two things I weighed heavily: Audience: Though I know primarily high schoolers read the blogs, many freshmen do as well. I won’t always be around to give advice and mentorship about navigating MIT’s many offices, or explain the things that I learned as a result of trauma, but I want this post to fill some of that space. Also, I think it’s important and relevant for anyone to know what the effects of assault, therapy, trauma, etc.  can So  this post is intended for everyone Content: There were points in my recovery where a post like this could have hurt me. My sophomore fall, I was surrounded by my trauma. I remember feeling an obligation to wade through it instead of coming back later; I imagine a lot of people could also feel like that. Suffering is not pleasant to read. I worry about someone getting halfway through, reaching incorrect conclusions, and clicking out. In many ways, I’ve been desensitized to my own past in a way that makes it easier for me to write about but harder for others to read. I have no measure of how this post will be received (sometimes I don’t feel anything while editing and sometimes I can only get through it in 15 minute intervals). I don’t want to scare someone away. But also, while I know that I could remove a lot of details, journal entries, sections, etc. I think it’s important to not sugar coat what recovery looks like. I worry about continuing a tradition that I’ve noticed in sensitivity training of addressing an audience of people who haven’t experienced assault. I have been in many workshops about how to support friends rather than how to support myself. A lot of these workshops make sexual assault something palatable. To be palatable, I think this post would need an ending (a justification to all my suffering), but recovery  isn’t Making my past palatable would be unfair and inaccurate, to survivors including myself. I am not a martyr; I have grown out of being unfair to myself for others’ sake. So, while I urge you to read with caution and patience, I tried to write a mostly honest account, even if it’s overwhelming at times. Please take care of yourself before, during, and after reading. The situations I’ve been in throughout my time at MIT are heavy; I have been disappointed by institutions and systems that are meant to support me. Still,  the ending is open—not happy, not sad—just some general conclusions I’ve tried my best to balance this post and I’ve gotten feedback from a lot of people before posting. This is why I’m including so much commentary. It’s with these thoughts in mind that I ask: If you think it’s time to stop reading—
 
at any point and for any reason ⁠ 01  This can be feeling overwhelmed, bored, sad, etc. I won’t know either way. This is also why I added section heads, so that there are natural pausing points to evaluate how you feel and whether you want to proceed. —my request is that you skip to the end and  just finish the last section . I say this with the hope that no one leaves this post without my current perspective, since the past is heavier and more pessimistic than the present. If you’re a current (or comMITted, congrats!) student, I will leave some free, on-campus resources at the end of the article, as well as some notes if I feel like I need to elaborate more. If you aren’t, I’ll list some resources as well, but I can’t speak on how they work as I haven’t personally used them. (Hair, Take 1) I’m imagining my high school self, again. I’ve been thinking, recently, about cutting my hair. I remember loving short hair. There’s a special feeling, after they buzz the hair on your neck, where it’s just long enough to be stubbly, but too short to hurt your hands.  I’m imagining my high school self, and thinking about how different I am from that girl, and what I would say to prepare her for what’s to come. I suppose it’s normal with the incoming class admitted, and graduation not long after. The thoughts leak out of me, so I’m going to write them. But first, some context. (Summer and Freshman Fall) The summer before my freshman year, I attended a summer program. I got very close to one of my TAs. I would sneak out of my room to see him. I talked to him about my high school, how little labels meant to me, and how I was progressing on calling things discrimination. I told him how I’d had to hide my relationship with my ex-girlfriend. He and I would break rules that were in place to protect me, though I wouldn’t realize that yet. I felt… anxious around him, but I feel anxious around everyone. Halfway through July, he told me that the Head TA—his big in his frat—had warned him that the other TAs noticed him getting close to me and were considering going to  “snake him.”  He said, “We have to be more careful.” He said, “We can’t hold hands in public anymore.” He said, “Don’t worry, but I have to think about my job.” He didn’t say: Happy Birthday. The summer ended.  We didn’t establish a label for what we were doing, but I didn’t think I needed one. He was very adamant about the lack of labels, though he said labels meant a lot to him. I
 
could ⁠ 02 In journal entries from two years ago, I used the word “should” here, but that is not a useful thought pattern. I want to point it out, because while the warning flags I’ve written seem obvious, that is only because of the years of retrospect. It is not fair to blame my past self for trusting that someone wouldn’t violate my autonomy.<br />
  have taken this as a warning, but I didn’t. Alongside the anxiety, I used to feel safe with him.  And then. Well, then I didn’t. He was homophobic, the hate-the-sin-not-the-sinner kind I’d gotten used to in high school. He told me he was glad I was with him because I couldn’t be queer with others. He was often quite mean to me. (I don’t know when I realized this; I have the journal entries but it’s not good to read them.) He made me feel stupid, reckless—a shush when I was too enthusiastic, a hand on my leg to keep it from bouncing, pinning my arms behind my back so I couldn’t reach out. There was one night in particular. I won’t go into details. He was never violent, exactly, but he would hold me down quite often. Sometimes, he would lay on my chest. My breath came ragged with his weight, but I couldn’t move from under him. I made it into a joke with my friends when they asked why I was scratching at my skin. They couldn’t see the same things I did. I wrote, Maybe it was good to have decisions taken away from me because I wasn’t very good at making them.  I felt anxious, and wasn’t sure why.  This didn’t feel the way relationships used to. I was like a pet to him, there to entertain but not think.  He said I should let my hair grow out: “I like you better with long hair.” I wrote, what should I change to get him to care for me? I deleted some paragraphs in case someone came across my journal entries and got the wrong impression. (I still haven’t found everything, but I think it might hurt more than help.) November 1st (yes,  that November 1st ), I asked him on a date. He said he’d talked to God during a faith retreat before the semester started; God said we couldn’t date because I wasn’t Christian. I cried, and thought of it as a break-up, despite him saying we’d never technically dated. I thought of him as I walked on campus, through the infinite, the physics department, the banana lounge.  I was living in Maseeh at the time and wondered, desperately, if MIT—as a place, as a concept—would ever belong to me. (Hair, Take 2) I’m looking through pictures, again, despite being surrounded by friends. I come across my graduation pictures. In it, my hair is curly, and short, hitting just barely above my ears. It’s pushed to the side so the ends wouldn’t tickle my eyes. There’s a grin on my face, so wide my cheeks push into my eyes. The next picture I scroll past is from July—two days before my birthday. I’m wearing a gray MIT hoodie—one that I didn’t take off for months—and have my hair in a half ponytail. I can see the difference those three months had on me. It was strange for me to let it grow that long. I used to argue with my mom about cutting my hair short. She never liked it, said the hairdressers left it  mordido  and that I didn’t put effort into styling it.  Scrolling through more photos, I watch my hair grow longer. Someone who I recognize as myself looks back at me, but it’s like a reflection in a pond, the ripples bending and distorting my face. Her teeth aren’t visible, eyes don’t crinkle in the corner. And her  hair : it’s past her ears, past her chin, past her neck. It doesn’t curl anymore, tangled in her fingers. And then, my hair is short again. The picture is distorted still. I’m smiling, but my eyelids are swollen too full, the corners of my mouth bent in a weird shape. It’s the type of look that, were she to see it, my mom would ask why I’ve been crying. I settle on a picture of myself with short hair from my junior year of high school instead of any of those. In it I have cat whiskers on my face as a show of spirit, and my hair is cut above my eyes. It’s from before I changed my smile, so one of my eyes is more squinty than the other. “I’ve been thinking about cutting my hair again,” I say. One of my friends tilts their head into my lap and my fingers scratch at their scalp, leaving oil from the trail mix I’d been eating moments earlier. We talk about haircuts and whether they’re a religious experience. I notice distantly that I’m pulling at their hair.  “Sorry, sorry,” I say, reminding myself to soften my grip.  (Summer after Freshman Fall) Eventually: I let go of the friends I had in the fall. I joined The Tech. I moved into a new dorm. I met my sorority. I became a TA for that summer program. (My feelings towards it are complicated; much  later  I described its effects as a bruise.) I knew my ex would be returning as a TA. Before the first week of the summer program, I reconnected with my old roommate, Sophia, who was also TA-ing. We had training together for classroom management, DEI issues, sexual assault and harassment.  After the first day of training, I read her a journal entry. I’d cried after reading one sentence in particular: “I’m not sure how much I wanted it before he actually started doing it.” She looked taken aback, and I worked quickly to dissuade the notion that anything was wrong.  “I’m just dramatic,” I told her.  
VPR ⁠ 03 Violence Prevention and Response  came to talk to us about sexual harassment at training the next day. The moderator talked about how sexual violence is always about power. Who had more power in your relationship? They played a clip from NPR of a woman describing her sexual harassment. The perpetrator was her boss. Sophia put her hand on my shoulder in a silent question.  I smiled back at her. But I couldn’t stop thinking about my past self. I wrote and rewrote those journal entries so that they would sound better; why had I left that sentence in?  I pinned up a pride flag in my room and thought about the previous summer. We spent hours talking about what had happened during my relationship, but couldn’t say everything yet. Sophia encouraged me to email VPR. And yet, how could I?  “Sometimes,” I said, “I feel like I owe him something for being at MIT.” Eventually that summer, another TA, Stella, came to me to ask about my relationship. I didn’t want to talk about it, so I told her I was in the process of figuring things out.  I said, “He wasn’t very nice to me.” It has taken me years to feel comfortable with the words abuse, sexual assault, and manipulation. Not nice was the best I could say. She told me about some of her students, and how they felt nervous with him. He was touchy and overbearing and had been getting uncomfortably close to one of them in particular. After what I had told her, she said, he seemed to be following a pattern. Before anything else, I hurt. Anxiety dripped down my limbs, soaking into my hands and feet. (When I was in high school, I used to go to my teacher’s room and lay down next to his bookshelf: The carpet is surely dirty and speckled with green and blue through its mostly gray. The ceiling has little holes that become constellations if you watch long enough. The best way to be there is on your back. If you twist to the right, there are books with cracked spines and dog-eared pages and little crescent shaped dents from bumping into things in a backpack. There’s a sign in dad-style letters on the frame of the shelves, put up slightly ajar. But the most important part is the sound coming from behind the desk. The periodic scratch of a red, BIC pen. Typing, fast and loose. A laugh, coming out like a breath. It’s the most important because it reminds you that—despite the near silence, the numbness in your fingertips, the stars swirling on the ceiling in the rhythm of your pulse—you are not alone. ) I longed to lay on carpet instead of the tiled Maseeh floor beneath me. Stella sat in front of me, still, watching as I processed what to say. She asked whether I would talk to the coordinator of the program. I wasn’t sure, and thus started the long chain of difficult choices. Eventually, I went to VPR, walking to the door with her. Stella held my hand as we lingered in the waiting room. The moderator from our training came out to greet us, offered me water.  “No thank you,” I squeezed out. I felt too large for the room I was led into, my jacket folded over my lap and hands growing numb. I rubbed at my fingers, trying to get blood flowing again. In the room, we talked about what consent meant. She explained to me the concept of a disempowered no.  What should I do? She wouldn’t tell me.
 04  You’ll see me use a similar phrasing later, but it has some nuance. VPR functions in a way to allow victims to reclaim agency. As frustrating as it could be, especially with so many questions at the early half of my recovery, I know it would have been ultimately worse if my counselors made decisions on my behalf. So while I say often that they wouldn’t, please know that they shouldn’t have, and that the same frustrations allowed me a sense of ownership over the decisions I made.<br />
 I went back to my single in Maseeh and drank hot chocolate in a mug my parents sent me from Mexico. I started writing An Important Summary (as it was titled in the google doc) and didn’t stop until my drink had gone cold for the third time. I read it aloud to the head of the program, disappointed each time a tear fell: “I tell you this now because I am concerned about the scholars in this cohort.  I’ve been wondering how all the other TAs during my summer had let this happen. Had seen the amount of time that we had been spending together, been concerned, and didn’t do anything. I wish someone had. I am in a position now where I hold influence over the future of my students. I am in the same position my TAs were last summer. I could not live with myself if I waited any longer. I could not even begin to imagine what I would feel if this were to happen again.” She thanked me for sharing my concerns with her. She told me she believed me, and that explicit labels like “dating” didn’t mean anything regarding the rules of the program. During our training, they’d emphasized that dating a student would get you immediately terminated as a TA. After I talked to the head, my ex couldn’t engage one-on-one with the students, grade psets, or host office hours. But he wasn’t fired.  I thought about how we’d get the same stipend when the summer ended. I wondered, briefly, why the head of the program hadn’t reported the incident to
 
IDHR ⁠ 05  The name for the office at MIT that handles cases around gender based discrimination, including harassment, assault, and more under Title IX.  the way VPR warned me she would. (Sophomore Fall, Take 1 – VPR) Time moved; I started my second year at MIT.  There are gaps in my memory about who exactly I was, but I didn’t connect my identity to my agency the way I do now: “I’ve been thinking, now and always, what type of a person I want to be. Is it possible to be good at everything? But [if not], how do I choose? My limitations are clearer to me now than ever before.  Living is not easy, but it isn’t meant to be. At the very least, I know I am growing. Is that enough? Should it be?” I started going to VPR every week. The moderator moved on to a different office, so I was passed around from person to person. Every meeting, I would have a bullet point list of what had happened to me, why I was there, and what I wanted.  One of the great ironies of being a sexual assault survivor is that, eventually, I remembered the story more than the event; I still do: My freshman year, I dated someone who was not very nice to me. He used to be my TA. I think the power imbalance might have been bad. I wouldn’t call it rape because that’s a violent word, but— I’ve been struggling with waking up in the mornings and sleeping at night. I’ve always been naturally anxious, but choosing breakfast drives me to tears.  I’m not sure what I wanted when I was with him. I’m not sure how many things he chose for me.  I came to VPR in order to: Define what happened, Go back to the way I was before I met him, and Eventually, I met my VPR advocate for the rest of the semester. Her name was Claire, and she had hair the way I used to. It was a pixie, cut above her eyes, leaving her neck exposed. (I’d cut my hair short the previous semester, but couldn’t bear to get a trim after spending another summer with my ex. His words looped through my head—“I like you better with long hair.”) Claire had an energy about herself. She wore shawls and signed off her emails with ‘warmly,’ and though her eyes were blue, they didn’t remind me of my ex’s the way others’ did. Instead, they reminded me of my big, Ruth’s (though I wouldn’t make that connection until months after our first meeting). In her office, the chairs were rotated 45 degrees so that I wouldn’t have to make eye contact when I couldn’t. I often couldn’t, so I familiarized myself that semester with the tapestry on her wall. There was a large circle in the middle, with a repeating pattern and lines trailing off around the center. My fingers twisted against my jeans, refusing to reach for the fidget toys on the table, as I traced the lines on the artwork in my head.  At the beginning of each session, Claire would ask if I wanted tea. I shook my head each time, until halfway through the semester. She asked me, once, twice, three times. On the third, I said, “Actually, if you have any, chamomile please.” Claire smiled at me, the edges of her blue, blue eyes wrinkling; she said, “It always takes three offers before someone takes the tea.” She realized what I didn’t at the time: this was progress. I was accepting help, even if I wasn’t comfortable requesting it yet. I took the tea the next meeting too.  (Sophomore Fall, Take 2 – Frats) After the summer, my students started asking me questions that I didn’t know how to answer: What happened? How much should my ex be held accountable? How much should I be? Who should they trust? Why did this happen? I felt like I was lying, because there were too many missing pieces in my head. Pages into my journal entries, the narrative stopped making sense. At the beginning of the semester, one of the students asked if he could talk about me to his ex’s frat. He’d heard about what happened, not from me but from someone else I hadn’t told. Panic spread through to my fingertips. Just how much of my life had spread through that summer program?  I told him, “No, I didn’t want to talk. I needed to take care of myself before explaining the situation to anyone else.” “But,” he said, “surely if his frat exec knew, something would be done about it.” I didn’t say I knew they wouldn’t do anything; it was my ex’s big who’d warned him about the other TAs thinking about reporting him that summer. “We aren’t using your name,” he said, “but people should know he wasn’t a good guy.” “Please,” I begged, “stop talking about me like a warning program.” After that conversation, I returned to the lounge next to my room and sat with Ruth. We drank chamomile with the handles of our mugs touching, a bag of mandarins open between us. I cried. She rubbed my hand, my fingers cold against her palm. Another student asked me to talk to the girl Stella warned me my ex had grown close with. She was confused why, suddenly, my ex couldn’t talk with her the way they used to. I faced her on the bed and told her about disempowered no’s. We met eyes and she asked why I was so reckless in my relationships. I wrote: “None of the students actually know me, and that’s the real problem. I’m forced to listen as they describe how my experience has affected them. Do they know they too are hurting me? I don’t want to see him. I don’t want to hear about him. I am in so much pain. How much pain is enough for people to believe me? In the darkness of my room, I think I know the answer. But I won’t. I can’t give him any more pieces of myself. I refuse to give myself as an offering to him. I refuse to let his memory take anything else.” The student who’d been debating whether or not to join my ex’s frat did so anyway, along with six other students to whom the information had spread. Ironic, I thought, that he’d said the frat would do something with the knowledge of my past when he didn’t do anything with it himself. Later in the semester, as I walked to lecture, I saw their members doing a fundraiser for BARCC, the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center. They do that fundraiser every year. My student stopped me, asked if I wanted to buy anything from the table. I smiled back, and told him I was late to class. There was a joke there, but I couldn’t find it. Instead, I breathed in. My pulse didn’t go down until I laid down on my carpet, next to my bookshelf in New House. (Sophomore Fall, Take 3 – Title IX) That semester, I went semi-regularly to
 
S^3. ⁠ 06  Student Support Services  I was assigned to Sol, who sat me down and asked what was going on in my life. I told her the bullet points. I’d come to S^3 preemptively, so in case something came up, she would already have the context.  She was a mandatory reporter, and would have to talk to IDHR  about it. She asked if I had been referred before. I told her I hadn’t. She frowned and asked, “Didn’t you say you’d told people outside of VPR this information?” I didn’t understand why she was asking exactly, but confirmed I had. She looked at me again and said, “All that will happen is you’re going to get an email asking if you want to connect with someone at IDHR.” I asked Claire, when I finally received the email, what should I do? She returned the question: what did I want? I wasn’t sure. Even after a couple of weeks of regularly talking about it, I didn’t know what to make of the situation. Slowly, I got worse at making decisions. I wrote, “I’m more sensitive, more uncertain. I’m starting to think this has been affecting more parts of my life than I realized.  It’s been difficult for me to know what it is that I want, not just with the [IDHR] meeting, but everything. I suffer because of the smallest things. It’s a waste of my time and energy most days: What is right? What is moral? What  should  I be doing? I feel so guilty about making decisions I haven’t even made yet. I’m so tired of choosing. It’s just hard to make the right choices when I don’t know what those are.” I made progress at VPR as Claire and I worked through more and more of my relationship. I told her that maybe I did want to go to IDHR; I couldn’t keep wondering what my ex thought about the relationship.  I wanted for him to understand how much he hurt me, even though I knew his harm had been intentional. I reread journals with Claire’s voice guiding me, correcting habits I saw myself forming.  “I’m more sensitive, more uncertain. I’m starting to think this has been affecting more parts of my life than I realized.  ← How can I be more generous with myself? It’s been difficult for me to know what it is that I want, not just with the [IDHR] meeting, but everything. I suffer because of the smallest things. It’s a waste of my time and energy most days: What is right? What is moral? What  should  I be doing?   ← When is it okay to “should” myself? I feel so guilty about making decisions I haven’t even made yet. I’m so tired of choosing. It’s just hard to make the right choices when I don’t know what those are.  ← Why does there have to be a right choice? ” I opened the IDHR email again, and responded. After preparing with Claire, I was committed to going into the meeting alone. I went over the new list in my head: I am not interested in taking legal action, at this time. I want to know the options available to speak to him with the goal of understanding and acknowledging his behavior. I want to know the ways IDHR can prevent him from repeating his behavior in the future.  I walked into the office after my math class. The IDHR director sat me directly in front of her, flipping open a notepad and pen in hand.  “Tell me,” she said, “what happened?” I went through the narrative, sloppy even though I was well-practiced in it. She asked what I wanted to do, but I only managed to reach the second bullet point. I left her office an hour after I first came in, my knees bending inwards as I walked. She told me they would reach out with more options, since she wasn’t clear on what I wanted. I kept rubbing at my fingertips, trying to get heat into them again. I had a lecture immediately after, but skipped it to lay on the couches outside my class.  (Sophomore Fall, Take 4 – Course 18) MIT is a school. It’s also many things besides that, but you take classes. In October, I had three exams, two vocab quizzes, and an essay due the same week; I went to appointments at IDHR, VPR, S^3, and two shifts at my job.  It was too much.  But both exams were on a Friday; if I could just take one of them later, I convinced myself, it would be okay. I messaged Sol on Monday and got approval to get an extension from my professor.  He replied, “I don’t give extensions to students struggling in my class; students don’t always know what’s good for them.” He told me he was available the Tuesday after the exam, and we could go over any mistakes then. I cried.  I emailed him again, “Please, could I have an extension?” This time I stressed I was dealing with things outside of academics and the exam wouldn’t be a reflection of what I’d learned.  On Thursday morning, I took a shower and brushed my hair. I tucked in my white and gray striped shirt into jeans and hummed contently as I made breakfast: eggs and coffee. I’d started adding things to my standard meal since I was doing better with deciding what to eat.  It was shaping up to be one of the only good days of the semester.  My professor emailed me back that life was unfair for everyone, and I didn’t deserve special treatment because I was homesick. I hadn’t mentioned being homesick; he assumed I was a freshman. I usually had breakfast with Ruth, but not that day. Instead, the sun shone on me as I spilled coffee on my shirt. (The stain is still there after two years.) I thought about how MIT was too big for me after all this time; it was inflexible and unnavigable. And it still didn’t belong to me—as a place or a concept—the way it did to my ex. I talked to Sol. She told me I didn’t have to take the exam, they could pressure him into giving me more time. She offered once, twice, three times. I turned it down; my life would be harder if he was angry.  I failed my exam. I wrote, “I keep thinking, if I were a professor, would I think differently? Why is he punishing me? If I were my professor, I would’ve given myself the extension, even if I didn’t think it was necessary.  I could hardly get out of bed today. I could hardly think about my future. I considered the possibility that everything would be easier if I weren’t alive.  Maybe he wouldn’t have given it to me, but I would have. I want to believe that matters. There have to be professors that exist like me: people in positions of power that know and understand what I feel.” I went into his office the following Tuesday, bringing the graded copy of my exam. As soon as I sat down in the chair, directly facing him, I turned my face down to look at my hands.  He flipped the cover page over, revealing bright, red marks in my peripheral. He tried explaining the problem but I couldn’t focus on anything other than the skin at the edge of my finger. I pulled back my cuticle, stubby nails letting out more blood than I thought possible from such a small wound.  He turned to the second question. I had taken the full time on the exam, but the page was blank. A tear fell from my cheek. I couldn’t wipe it away without revealing the blood flowing from my thumb.  He told me that he saw me at office hours often. I nodded. He asked if I was working with other people. I was—two friends who were taking his class and an upperclassman. Still, I wouldn’t meet his eyes.  He told me, “You’re doing everything right, so I don’t know what to recommend.” I bowed my head further forward to hide my face entirely. The tears kept leaking so I squeezed my eyes until I could see little constellations. I couldn’t feel my hands; I couldn’t feel a pulse.  And then, I was in my room at New House, still clutching my thumb to my palm. I discovered, though, just what I wanted from IDHR: “I feel buried with the amount of things that I have to learn to live with. I just have to live with it, because that’s the way the world works. As if we don’t have an obligation to make the world just a little bit better. It’s so easy to forget we have power when we’ve spent so long being overshadowed by others.  I keep thinking about the sentence “As if we don’t have an obligation to make the world just a little bit better.” Maybe this is where my
 
should ⁠ 07 This journal entry was written in response to a prompt Claire gave me: “Why do you think you should talk to him?” This was a recurring wall I ran into as we discussed what to do about IDHR. In many ways, I felt I should because of bad mental habits, and because that was how I felt the “sexual assault story” went. She asked, often, instead of “should” what did I “want,” which helped me regain a sense of self and desire.  Maybe this is why I need to talk to him. It’s flipping the tables for me to be the one to plan the meeting, for me to be prepared with what I want to say and why. I am in the position to say something to him without fearing repercussions; it’s my responsibility and right to correct him. I feel like I could rephrase these to more accurately represent what I feel. I  want  to correct him. I  want  to reclaim the ability to look him in the eye. I passed him in the infinite today. He was as scruffy as he was over the summer. I saw him quickly, and felt my chest tighten. I lowered my eyes to the floor. I didn’t want him to see me, was that for my sake or his? Once again, the question: Do you know? Have you learned the ways in which you hurt me? I want this meeting to find closure. What does closure look like? Closure would mean that I could stop searching for his face in every crowd. Stop fearing what I’ll find when I cross the street. Stop holding my breath when I walk along the physics department. It means not having to consider, always,  does he know? does he know? does he know?  Journaling like this was very nice. What a relief it is to share the things that I feel I could never speak out loud. What a relief it is to get thoughts out of my brain, and lay them to rest.” (Sophomore Spring) Winter break came and went. I found myself crying quite often. Already, I felt anxiety bubbling up within me; I had my plans—from VPR and IDHR to my academics. None of them came to fruition.  Instead, I packed up my bags, spent my last night on campus  laying on a sheet-less mattress  with Ruth, and flew to California.  Being at home helped, more than anything else. My parents made it clear that our house could be my home, whenever I needed a place to return to. But I remembered the previous semester, how I deliberated every decision, standing in front of the grocery aisle, my wardrobe, my fridge. I considered it differently: how many people had found themselves in the same state? I wrote  my first article  in The Tech, describing some of the solutions I’d found to that urgent feeling, suspended in time, tired, and distressed. But I didn’t feel better: “What is the point of waking up? What is the point of doing anything?   Sometimes, I don’t know the answer to those questions. Sometimes, the answer isn’t enough to convince me. I have so much to live for. I know that I have to believe that. I know that I do believe that. If I truly thought life had no meaning, I would be dead. Is this enough of a red flag for you yet, Ana? I know you will read this and feel sorry for me. I know that you won’t be able to understand, from wherever you are in the future. There is much I love about this world. How is it possible for me to love my life, and feel too tired to live it?” I considered scheduling something at VPR but Claire had moved to a different job and their staff was overwhelmed.  No one from IDHR reached out to me again, despite agreeing that they would check in before my ex graduated and I lost my opportunity. I tried to pretend he didn’t exist. Late at night, I scrolled through graduation pictures wondering if I would see him in one.  (Junior Spring, Take 1 – A Good Day) Eventually, we were allowed back on campus. I wrote, “I have to be careful, I know. I’ve changed, but I’m not sure if that’s enough. I’m terrified of the future. I’m scared I’m not going to be enough for whatever’s coming. Last night, I was tired and convinced myself I had never been sexually assaulted. It happens. I’m not sure what it means that I can’t get past this. Am I supposed to be able to get past this? I worry, worry, worry. Am I really that different from who I was?” My junior year wasn’t any easier than the previous, but at least MIT belonged to me with my ex gone. One of my underclassmen friends asked to go on a walk, at the beginning of being on campus. She asked me about my experiences at MIT and how I’d moved on from my past relationship. At that point, I’d written about my experiences as a survivor, although I’ve always hated that word. I led her for hours through Boston, getting lost once in a while. I thought about how to explain progress: “ Yesterday, I spent 60 dollars on groceries, took the bus home, carried both bags with two good arms back to my studio apartment and cooked myself dinner. You and I may have different definitions of a good day. … Flossed in the morning, locked my door, and remembered to buy eggs. My mother is proud of me. It is not the kind of pride she brags about at the golf course. She doesn’t combat topics like, ”My daughter got into Yale” with, ”Oh yeah, my daughter remembered to buy eggs” But she is proud. See, she remembers what came before this. The weeks where I forgot how to use my muscles, how I would stay as silent as a thick fog for weeks. She thought each phone call from an unknown number was the notice of my suicide. These were the bad days. … But today, I want to live. I didn’t salivate over sharp knives, or envy the boy who tossed himself off the Brooklyn bridge. I just cleaned my bathroom, did the laundry, called my brother. Told him, “it was a good day.” Kait Rokowski  “A Good Day” I wanted to tell her that there is an end to the anguish, that eventually you bottom out. I wanted to lie to her. Instead I told her what I’d actually learned—sexual assault changes you.  When I first started therapy, I wanted to act as if this hadn’t happened; yet there’s no part of my life that hasn’t been tinted. There was never a way for me to get over it. But I’ve had more good days. I know they’re there, somewhere in me. We got back to my dorm. I hid the wetness in my eyes. I hugged her goodbye. My feet ached. (Junior Spring, Take 2 – Visiting Committee) A couple of weeks later, I was invited to talk to the
 
Visiting Committee. ⁠ 08 A group which provides feedback on each department for the MIT Corporation.  With CoMM, an advocacy group in the math department, I typed up an Appendix to the meeting of various student issues.  We all wrote our own versions of the problems within the department; in mine I retold the story, only a year and a half prior, of being denied an extension to my exam: “I share these things and often get told that people are “so sorry” the system failed me. The implication is that this isn’t something that regularly happens to students. I know several others who have had their requests for accommodations rejected harshly, who were doubted or dismissed without any other considerations. I imagine my professor didn’t know how he had hurt me; he probably sent that email carelessly and didn’t consider how it would be received. I’ve thought about that particular email at least two or three times every semester since receiving it. Sometimes I read it again and think, do I really belong here? I’m angry at the professors who hurt me, but more than that, I am deeply disappointed that nothing has been done since to improve the lives of students, like me, who faced struggles outside of their control.”  In the meeting, I couldn’t keep my hands from shaking. I’d made tea prior to joining to have something warm to hold, and I set it on my desk. When we moved to the larger zoom room, I uploaded the Appendix, carefully made, into the chat. The head of the committee pretended not to receive it. He said, “The conclusion I’ve made is that the department is making progress, even if it’s slow moving.” I spilled tea onto my hands and desk. I emailed the document directly to him after the meeting: “Though the department might be improving, current issues are still actively harming students, particularly ones in marginalized groups. Slow progress is still progress, but to act as if this is enough is to ignore the many examples of students being harmed by institutions that are doing too little, too late.” After I left the zoom call, I texted into my pod group chat and asked someone to give me a hug. It was hard to type.  I realized I would have to explain the story to anyone close to me for the rest of my life.  Later that night, I talked on the phone with my co-president in my sorority. They didn’t know everything about the fall, or what happened the summer prior. After our conversation, they texted me a note of encouragement and said, “you’re so strong.”  I rolled that word over on my tongue—strong. (Querida Ana,) Querida Ana, I’ve been imagining you, recently—what I would say to you if I could.  Here is what morning looks like: I woke up and turned off my alarm to sleep more. I wore pajamas and a face mask to the kitchen, opened the fridge and made scrambled eggs with spinach, Mexican shredded cheese, and mushrooms. I took out the milk from the fridge, and prepared coffee with the cup that my sister got me. The coffee is always the same: two unleveled scoops of ground beans, four seconds of pouring honey, and a splash of milk. I don’t measure the quantities anymore. This morning, I wanted something sweet so I made some toast with jam. I didn’t hesitate. But a couple of months ago, I opened my fridge and saw that there were four cartons of eggs with varying levels of fullness and two bags of grapes. Too much to choose between, I thought.  “There are too many grapes,” I told Ruth instead, and started crying. I’m imagining you—the way the word “love” came so easily. Loving still comes naturally, but  you’ve been reserved about saying it .  Would you recognize me now? I’ve been thinking about your hair.  I have long hair, but have been thinking about shedding the layers, the ends of my hair curling because a weight was removed. I have bangs, which you never would have done four years ago.  I’ve come to love my hair. Haircuts are a religious experience, but so is having my friend make two slightly lopsided plaits, so is cutting my bangs with the kid watching. The kid is a sophomore in my sorority; she looks at me the way you look at Ruth.   Life is not easy, and maybe it’s not meant to be, but there are many people who love you.  I’ve been debating what to write here because regrets are not worth it. But let’s stop the suspension of disbelief for a second because I’m not writing to a younger version of myself, I am writing to you, my reader.  Here are two facts: Much of my  recovery  involved being physically close to my family, and far from MIT. This was largely due to a pandemic I had no control over. MIT was a childhood dream and I would have never passed up the opportunity to come here.  I wish I had been more prepared for what was to come. I wish I’d thought about how I would change. I flinch when I am touched. I can’t always say “I love you too.” I have difficulties making decisions. But I don’t want this post to be against MIT or attending college. Here is the message I want to give: Institutions that are supposed to protect you (support you, nourish you) don’t.  At MIT in 2019, 18-27% of cis undergraduate women, 7-9% of cis undergraduate men, and 12-19% of trans, gender-queer, or nonbinary students experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact” according to the
 
AAU Survey Report. ⁠ 09  A collaborative project of American Universities which sought to prevent and respond to sexual assault and other misconduct on college campuses. The complete survey report for MIT can be found here: http://web.mit.edu/chancellor/aau/2019-AAU-Survey-Report-for-MIT.pdf. If you’re sensitive to it, I recommend a cup of tea while reading.  The lower number in the range reflects a
 
narrower definition ⁠ 10  Use of force or inability to consent due to alcohol and other substances.  of sexual assault, while the higher number represents a more
 
comprehensive definition. ⁠ 11 The previous definition as well as coercion and absence of consent. These results came out my sophomore year. I can’t remember what I answered.  Sexual assault is incredibly underreported, most commonly because the
 
“survivor” ⁠ 12 I use quotations here because I’ve always hated the word survivor when referring to me, but I know that label is empowering to a lot of other people.  doesn’t see it as
 
“severe enough” ⁠ 13  This is the most common answer on the AAU report.  regardless of the type of assault. It surrounds us, even when I couldn’t see it. After mine, I felt like I’d entered a different world. The summer after my sophomore year, I joined a student group advocating for survivors of sexual violence. I learned more about how IDHR is  supposed  to work, and the number of ways it fails victims. The other members had experienced investigations that were over a year long, lost documentation, and were forced to explain what had happened, over and over again, to counselors, deans, and lawyers.  I didn’t include these stories in this post because they aren’t mine to tell. I know just how important agency is after these events. No one other than us seemed to understand just how often systems and institutions function to hurt people. It has taken me years to see it, but it’s there, hidden in all the context: My TAs should have reported my ex that summer, but the head of the program should have fired him the summer after. I should not have had to exploit my own history to prevent sexual assault from happening again.  I should not have had to push on my anxiety and boundaries to teach my professors, my students, the Visiting Committee, and more.  My friends shouldn’t have asked so much vulnerability from me, but I shouldn’t have had to teach them not to. My professor should have given me that extension, but he should not have been the end of the line for accommodations. I shouldn’t have had to fear retaliation. IDHR should have followed up. I should have been allowed the closure I wanted. This is not a comprehensive list. There is no advice that I can give to avoid the path that I’ve taken, nor would I want to give that advice. I am not a warning story, and my life is not your future. And regardless, the only thing we can say prevents sexual assault is if the person in question had decided not to assault someone. Saying anything else is saying a survivor caused their own victimization. Still, this post doesn’t feel done. I fell in love with MIT when I arrived; it has taken me four years to realize it’s more complicated than that.  IHTFP. I have truly found paradise. I hate this fucking place. I have ended with that before because it is the only conclusion that I can actually reach. This place is my sorority, my weird friend groups, my communities, my home. This place is that summer program, the math department, IDHR, and bureaucracy that functions so slowly it feels impossible to make change.  This is an excessive amount of context to say the obvious: MIT is a place made up of people. For anyone who was, is, or will be in my position: I’m sorry that you had, have, will have to be so strong. There isn’t a better description—strength is another one of those words that has taken me years to come to terms with; I don’t always feel strong, and often I don’t  want  to be. Find the people that help, be generous with yourself, and know that it gets better. For everyone: thank you for reading this post. I hope it did a bit more to break down the barrier between the world of victims and everyone else.  There is always a way to help others, no matter what position you hold. I have found overwhelming comfort at an extension granted, a meal offered, a hand outstretched to help me up when I’ve tripped.

Dance ‘Til You Drop is an  annual party 
the Sunday of Patriot’s Day weekend. ⁠ 01 the weekend of the Boston Marathon (taken from my  2020 post DTYD started in 1969 when two Bombers (Classes of ’70 and ’71) wanted to celebrate their 21st birthdays and decided to indulge in a party that lasted four whole days. Burton Third had always held a floor party on Patriot’s Day, so the next year, the two parties were combined into an event that lasted from Saturday night until Thursday. This took place in Hamilton House, the place where the Bombers were exiled to when Burton House was closed down during the 1970-71 academic year. When Burton House reopened, the party, which was now known as DTYD, returned to MIT in full force. DTYD III featured a $1,000 budget, fireworks on Briggs Field, and even more debauchery than that of its forebearers. Throughout the years, DTYD expanded to include more semi-official traditions such as canoe trips, Red Sox game outings etc. Most of these, unfortunately, have died out, but the fact remains that DTYD and all its auxiliary events provide a “great oasis in the middle of the academic year.” Burton Third
 
floor chairs ⁠ 02 exec members Even though the canoe trips and Red Sox game outings are no longer traditions, DTYD weekend continues to be exceptionally involved; it features several events involving alumni, which gives them plenty of reason to come back to Boston to celebrate. A normal Patriot’s Day Weekend schedule looks something like this:  Alumni Pub Crawl, where alumni and 21+ bombers venture to bars around Cambridge  Bomber Formal, where we all dress up fancy, eat nice food, and take way too many pictures  DTYD, where we rage  Alumni Barbecue and
 
MarMon, ⁠ 03 marathon monday DTYD L, which featured a whopping $16K budget, was held during my Campus Preview Weekend, back in April 2019. I had no conception of what the Bombers were at this time, but since I was staying on campus an extra day, I heard tons of students talking about the ongoing party. I had no interest in parties at the time and wasn’t about to be let in anyways, so I didn’t think about it much. How things have changed… Given that it was the 50th anniversary, there were even more auxiliary events than usual. this picture makes me both very happy and very sad–i’m glad so many alumni came back for dtyd L, but boy do i wish i was there to experience it pre pandemic restrictions There was an alumni brunch and an alumni hockey game to celebrate Burton Third’s undying hockey culture. We’re really bad at hockey and pretty much always have been, FYI. For DTYD L, literally hundreds of alumni flocked back to MIT to celebrate the occasion. Some were participants in the first few DTYDs! When I wrote the blog about the Bombers in 2020, I fully anticipated to have a DTYD, but since the event takes place in April and the pandemic hit in March, I was unable to experience it. Two years later, I’m a floor chair and was thus responsible for running this party despite having never attended one. Thankfully, DTYD 53rd was nowhere near the same scale as DTYD 50, but it was still pretty stressful to plan for someone whose only conception of it comes from stories they’ve heard from upperclassmen. We scheduled Walker Memorial for DTYD back in May 2021. We were immediately met by the issue of Walker closing at 10 pm on the Sunday of Patriot’s Day weekend. Also, it was Easter that day!! A 7-10 pm event would be horrible, and hosting a party on Easter wasn’t an option either, so we looked at the Saturday of that weekend, but it was fully booked.  Due to this, we decided to move the party to the 23rd, even though it goes against tradition. But hey, at least the date has a 3rd in it… In early January, we started thinking about DTYD more concretely. We met with Hannah ’19, a former floor chair, to discuss the party and all its auxiliary events. For formal, we asked about what type of venue we’d need since our traditional venue, The Asgard, closed during the pandemic. We also asked about budgeting and how much we’d need for the drinks and food tabs. Since booking venues is expensive, we decided on our timeframe, as well as where we would go for the formal afterparty. As for DTYD itself, we knew very little about how serving alcohol works at parties; we were told that there are a lot of rules we need to keep in mind (obviously, since it concerns alcohol), and that we’d need a licensed bartender. We also would need to ID people at the entrance of the party in addition to checking their CovidPass, and would have to sell drink tickets at the door. In addition, we’re required to serve food alongside the alcohol, so we decided on catering tons of burritos. Hannah let us know that we’d need to send physical invitations to alumni ASAP so they’d be able to make it. After sending out our massive spreadsheet of alumni addresses for updates, we had an addressing party. With a few dozen people and lots of pizza, addressing and putting together ~550 envelopes didn’t take much time at all. Here’s our postcard design: designed by Kaitlin L. ’24 Ah, yes. Now that we’d invited hundreds of people to our party, we needed to acquire funding. We typically have a few funding sources for the party:
 
LEF, ⁠ 04 the large event fund In the past few years, the Boston-based band Juice used to play at DTYD, but now they’re a bit too popular for us to book them. This meant that we had to find another band. Thankfully, I’d met some Berklee girls on the
 
Esplanade ⁠ 05 the park alongside the Charles on the Boston side Some of the younger Bombers who hadn’t been to a DTYD were skeptical about having a live band at a party, but the upperclassmen convinced us that it’s a dope tradition. It’s mostly for us to hang out, eat and drink, and talk to alumni. The party really gets going once the actual DJ comes on, anyways. DTYD is traditionally accompanied by a hack that is planned by the freshman class. The hack is used to promote the party, so it’s usually something large, eye-catching, and in a well-traversed part of campus. Previous hacks include a 3rd.3rd meter tall orange 3rd filled with 1000 pounds of loose sand, a  bomber shirt saying DTYD 4/17 on The Alchemist the bomb squad the dtyd 50 hack, created by the Bomber class of ’22 This year, both the sophomores and freshmen planned the hack since neither class got a chance to in the past. My class never got to do a hack either, but the juniors are floor chairs and running the party itself, so thinking about a hack would be too much for us. A couple of ideas were pitched for the hack, including a fortune teller box with a picture of someone saying “I see DTYD in your future…,” and a giant orange banner wrapping around The Alchemist. The underclassmen settled on four giant pong cups filled with sand placed around campus. One went in the Banana Lounge, one was placed on the steps leading to Lobby 7, one went in Stata, and one went outside
 
Stud. ⁠ 06 the student center the Lobby 7 cup The underclassmen put the cups up at 5 am, and administration asked to take them down within a couple of hours into the school day. When we tried to take them down, however, the police stopped us. Ah, well! They were onto something; it’s not ideal for a bunch of students to try to heft a wooden structure filled with hundreds of pounds of sand into a giant cart in the middle of the day. Optional section dedicated to the murals portraying DTYD that were on Burton Third. We won’t have murals in the newly-renovated Burton Conner, so these will be dearly missed. probably refers to the bomb squad hack lfg DTYD 50!! DTYD XLV We built this 16-foot long sound reactive lightboard for DTYD 50. It was a crucial addition to the party and became a staple of future floor events, but was lost when we had to last-minute move out of Burton Conner in March 2020. A couple of Bombers decided that it would be worthwhile to rebuild. I mean, obviously, look at it. We started planning in early March and hoped to complete it before the party on April 23rd. First, we applied to grant funding and discussed where we would built the lightboard, since it’s really fucking huge. Then we started ordering supplies and designating roles. Thankfully, some Bomber ’21s who were involved in the original project had taken gap years and thus were still around to guide us. The actual building commenced in the first week of April. We needed to build the structure, paint the wood, cut it to size and assemble the supports. Then, we needed to do a ton of soldering. So much damn soldering. Finally, we would connect everything and pray it worked. the original lightboard in the Porter Room, where DTYD usually is Around ten Bombers worked nonstop for several days to finish everything on time. Testing commenced the day before DTYD, and only a singular LED strip ended up working, so our ability to finish was in peril. the wooden frame and supports Sadly, we were unable to finish the project in time. It’ll definitely be done by our party this October, though!! Making posters and putting them up is one of my favorite parts of event planning. I really enjoy making acronym posters and printing them on bright orange paper so they’re visible across campus. Some acronyms we used this year were: Da Thiccest Yonder Damsel, Don’t Twiddle Your Diddle, and the classic, Don’t Tell Your Dad (check out  this picture Here are some of the nice posters we made: …And here are the memey ones! no bitches? For context, this one is a parody of the “Who is MIT” posters, which were made to publicize a documentary about MIT made by two seniors here. Post about that coming soon! Imagine these posters on 13×19 high-quality paper, hanging all over campus. It was really something. One of the most fun parts of throwing a party. Our $700 budget included dozens of orange and black streamers, hundreds of glow sticks, fluorescent orange tape, large black balloons that spelled DTYD 53rd, and so many goddamn orange and black balloons.  We also got jumbo 36-inch balloons that we threw into the party when it reached its peak. We spent several hours on Saturday blowing up balloons (thankfully with a pump and not manually like last time), putting up streamers, making a dance floor out of the fluorescent tape, and plastering posters over the dividers splitting off the dance area from the rest of the room. Walker Memorial isn’t the most ideal space to throw a party, but throwing a shit ton of orange and black decor in definitely helps. decor setup DTYD is not a dry party. Having alcohol at a huge event entails jumping through a bunch of hoops to ensure everyone is kept safe. We had to submit a safety plan, find licensed bartenders, and obtain a police detail for the party. We also are legally required to serve food, so we catered hundreds of burritos. Due to last-minute issues with party registration, procuring a police detail became a bit of a roadblock. We ended up having to change the party from open to everyone to MIT-only, which was unfortunate. Thankfully, there ended up being no issues with security. People came in, and security checked their MIT IDs and gave them wristbands if they were over 21. Partygoers could purchase drink tickets for 33rd cents and present up to two at a time before the call time to get their drinks. We tracked drinks, capped everyone at five, and had security keep an eye out for anyone in danger. Food-wise, the burritos were a hit, even if they got a bit soggy by the end of the party. We restocked all the burritos we had in hand every half hour, and they were all gone by the end of the night. Festivities started on Thursday with the Alumni Pub Crawl and continued into Friday for the formal. Finding a venue for formal was an absolute disaster since the spaces we’d normally use had closed during the pandemic, but we managed to settle on a place in Faneuil Hall. It was pretty nice despite playing the worst remixes of songs I’d ever heard.. On Saturday, set-up began. We all showed up to Walker at 12 PM and started setting up decorations, moving tables, and putting up signs. We also had to do a sound check and meet with space coordinators to check-in about the party. With all the hands we had, everything took only a few hours, and we were able to go home to change and get ready. We rallied back at Walker around 7 for a fun tradition called hockey awards, where the Burton Third seniors present a funny award to each underclassman. For example, I received the “Town Crier Award” since I’m notorious on the floor for gossiping (oops!). After all the hockey awards are given out, the freshmen present senior superlatives to the seniors. We then took our class picture! Woooo! burton third class of 2022 The party started at 9 with the live band. No one really comes to parties from 9-10, so the band is traditionally for the Bombers to hang out and talk. I was a bit averse to a live band at a party, but I really enjoyed the music. They played peppy songs that were easy to vibe to, like Skate by Silk Sonic and Fuck You by CeeLo Green. They also played some of my favorite Strokes songs right now, like Under Cover of Darkness and You Only Live Once. After the band’s 90-minute set, we transitioned to the DJ, and the rest of the night was a blur. Dancing on the band stage with the other Bombers was super fun. Walker isn’t a great space since it’s huge and parties are way more fun when they feel packed, but I wasn’t too pressed about it. Naturally, we were limited by capacity, so as much as I wished all the people in the long line outside could be let in by security, we didn’t have a choice. Can’t wait for the Porter room next year! It’s way better for throwing parties, and it’s in our own dorm :’) When it ended, I afterpartied at a Bomber apartment until 5 AM. Usually, that’s not a great choice since we have to go clean the space in the morning, but I didn’t have to do any cleaning since two freshmen took care of it. Yay freshmen! Then, all we had to do was start setting up for the alumni barbecue. We were surprised to see a ’76 Bomber pull up to the event, and even more surprised to hear that hockey awards have been a DTYD tradition ever since he was a student. Some other alumni came and we chatted for a few hours, but then I had to say my goodbyes since I had so much fucking work to do after all the days of partying. And that concluded my first ever DTYD! It’s a pity that my first one had to be the year I was one of the people in charge of running it, but oh well. Shoutout to the other three floor chairs for doing such an amazing job with planning and running DTYD, and shoutout to everyone on the floor who helped set up, clean up, drive stuff around, haul   fucking heavy speakers, and make sure the party runs smoothly. DTYD and all its side events are an integral part of my community, so I’m grateful I finally got to experience them. I’m excited for my senior year DTYD, which will be on the weekend it’s supposed to be and in the place it’s traditionally hosted in. Also, I’ll be a senior (!!) and won’t have to do any work in terms of planning <333 Hope you enjoyed this not-so-brief glimpse into planning a 53-year old tradition :) ##dtyd #Bombers #Burton Third #Burton-Conner House

On Friday, I watched  Everything Everywhere All At Once , a movie where a woman gets to experience many of the other universes that might’ve appeared had she made a different decision somewhere in her life. In one universe, she decides not to follow her first love to America; instead, she becomes a kung fu master, living a glamorous life replete with red-carpet photoshoots and limousine rides. In another universe, she is a sign-spinner on a street corner. In other universes, she’s a teppanyaki chef, a rock on a sandy mountain ledge, a lesbian with hot dogs for fingers.  My younger brother, Kyler, will probably never become a rock or a kung fu artist, but still, he currently faces a decision of his own. He’s a high school senior choosing between Harvard and Stanford. And if you’re reading this, perhaps you are making an agonizing decision of your own, too. Several weeks ago, Kyler came to Cambridge for Visitas, Harvard’s visiting weekend for admitted high school seniors. He stayed with me for one night before crashing with his Harvard host. I kept worrying about him. Our mother had also come along, so I directed all my worry at her, peppering her with questions that thinly concealed my stress. “Do you think he was able to find his way out of the building?” My house is a confusing maze of stairs and winding hallways. “What if he accidentally opens the wrong door and goes inside someone’s bedroom?” “Do you think he’ll be okay taking the T?” The T being Boston’s subway system, which he used to get from MIT to Harvard. “What if he gets lost?” My concerns were so unnecessary. When I was a high school senior, I had visited MIT by myself for CPW, and it had been totally fine. But I couldn’t help but worry. Perhaps in my mind, Kyler was still twelve years old, immortalized as the kid he’d been when I left home for college.  I used to measure his height through its relativity to my own. When he was first able to walk, he came up to my hips; then he came up to my rib cage, then my armpits. I’m not sure when he finally outgrew me, but now he is much taller than I am. the author and her brother, 2022 (colorized) This blog post was supposed to be about giving my brother advice about which school to choose, but I’m not sure what advice I can give. Here we are, in this universe where I chose MIT. I love MIT in a bone-deep, ferocious sense that is probably uncool for an upperclassman, but I’m okay with being uncool. I will probably never have hot dogs for fingers or perform knife flourishes for restaurant customers, but I know I made the right decision all those years ago. Not everyone gets lucky with the choices they make. There was an older blogger who had been accepted to Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. She chose Harvard, partially due to a boy she met during Visitas, whom she fell in love with. Unfortunately, they broke up during her junior year of college. Near the end of her time at Harvard, she wondered on her blog if she had made the right decision: after all, MIT had been her first choice originally, and Stanford had beautiful weather and people seemed much happier there. After graduation, instead of pursuing medical school like she had dreamed of, she accepted a job at a prestigious consulting firm, a place where many of her peers at Harvard also worked. She told me she was going to use the consulting firm’s exit options to attend medical school, but I recently checked her LinkedIn and she is now a strategy and marketing consultant at a different company. If she had chosen a different school, would she have had a better outcome? How can we even compare outcomes, like, would it be better to be in crippling student debt as a med student or to receive a high salary as a consultant? And who is to say that her interests didn’t bend into a different path, and she is truly much happier now? I am not her, so I cannot make these judgments.  My best friend from high school dreamed of MIT, but he was waitlisted here. He attended Princeton instead. He majored in East Asian Studies there and now he’s doing a PhD in number theory at UCLA. Recently, he told me that he was glad he didn’t get in here, because our math department is very toxic sometimes and he would’ve felt pigeonholed into an identity he’d carved back in high school instead of branching out to explore other interests.  Petey has written many things, much better than I can, about  how we make and destroy our future selves every second of the day, how we can only really become ourselves . Who do you want to become? Which school will cultivate skills and values in you that are congruent with your current beliefs? But then again, how certain are you in your current beliefs? A lot of advice about choosing schools seems obvious. Location matters, and the quality of academic resources is important, and financial aid is a significant concern for most students. But Kyler likes both Cambridge and Palo Alto. Both Harvard and Stanford have incredible academic programs. He was fortunate enough to receive an outside merit scholarship that means his undergraduate education will be free. The deeper consideration, I think, is about how a school might shape a student. There are certain values that each school cultivates more strongly in their students. An example: MIT has pushed me to work much, much harder academically than I ever did in high school. I’m terrible at physics, but at MIT, I didn’t have much choice besides to take two semesters of physics, as it is a graduation requirement. It was a struggle and probably I got Cs in both classes, although they are Ps on my transcript.  I cross-registered for some classes at a different university and was surprised by how easy the grading was: I got As on every assignment and received little critical feedback. And I’m sure that many classes at this other school are difficult, but I also got the feeling that, if I wanted to, I could slip through that school without exerting much effort at all. I didn’t see the value of hard work until I came here. Some days I still find it immensely difficult to gather motivation to do anything besides lie in bed and look at memes, but some days I actually grind a problem set, and I actually care. No axis of the universe has actually shifted due to my efforts; nobody’s life besides my own has improved. I don’t even plan on applying to graduate programs, at least not ones where my GPA is particularly important, so my hard work doesn’t even matter much for my own career trajectory. I know all that. But I finally understand something that many adults in my adolescent life, from my parents to my teachers, had tried to reinforce over and over to no avail: that we only get this small pocket of time on earth, that we move through each minute in one irreversible direction, and I want to spend these few precious years actually  trying . The value of hard work isn’t in receiving full marks, or a high GPA, or anything else extrinsic. But I owe myself my very best. That’s a lesson I could’ve possibly learned at another school. But MIT is particularly difficult to fake one’s way through. I suspect that, at another institution, I would’ve kept avoiding the hard work.  To be honest, I wasn’t that excited to attend MIT, and I mostly chose it because it was better than my other options. I confess, perhaps I simply felt pressured to attend the most prestigious university I’d been admitted to. I wanted to be seen as an MIT person. There were other deciding factors, of course, but this is the unshakeable, undeniable truth underpinning every other consideration: that I wanted to move through the rest of my life with that social capital, the perception automatically bestowed upon those who wear brass rats. I wasn’t so self-aware at age seventeen that I could’ve evaluated my own shortcomings and selected an institution based on how I should grow. I got lucky, though. MIT turned out to be exactly the school I needed. Kyler’s visiting Stanford now. He hasn’t asked me for advice on where to choose, and he knows himself best; he’s fully capable of reflecting upon his own aspirations and selecting the best place that will allow him to thrive.  After Visitas, he excitedly told me about everyone he had met, all the amazing kids who could be his classmates if he wanted. The bittersweet realization struck me: our journeys were diverging. Kyler went to the same high school as I did, so I had given him advice on what classes to take, which teachers were lenient graders, how to avoid prerequisites. I had helped him revise his college applications. But now he was entering a world I knew little about. I couldn’t be his lighthouse anymore, guiding him through the dark. Sometimes, I wish I could go back and do it all again. I would be a better older sister if given another chance. I would be more patient, more generous, more compassionate. I was so young, I made so many mistakes, I didn’t realize that the amount of time we’ll ever spend in each other’s presence goes by so quickly and now it is already more than halfway, if not three-fourths, gone.  But we only have this life, don’t we? Time flows only forward. How lucky we are to exist together in this universe, to be the collective result of every decision made by those who came before us, to define the unknown for ourselves through every step we take. splish splash off into the great wide world you go

For the last few years, I’ve been living off-campus in a house full of other MIT undergraduate women. We’re part of MIT’s FSILG (Fraternity, Sorority, and Independent Living Group) system. My house is called WILG, short for Women’s Independent Living Group. Last summer, there was a fire at our house. a news headline about what happened I wasn’t living in the house at the time, but there were about four WILG members living here. According to them, somebody had first smelled smoke in the house, then after some investigating, they found that the source of the fire was in a vacant room, 408, that nobody was living in. So then they called the fire station. The firefighters came and unfortunately sustained chemical burns, but luckily these burns were considered minor (according to  this news article Anyway, a few weeks ago, a friend and I decided to figure out what had happened and why the fire had started. So I emailed the Cambridge fire station . . . the email Which they forwarded to the Public Records Officer at City Hall. A few weeks later, I received the full report on the fire. a response letter that they sent me, along with the report A lot of the report was redacted, as this response letter mentions. But it was still quite informative. there was a concerning handwritten note? Most of this part already aligned with what I knew, that this was some kind of chemical fire in room 408. But I hadn’t heard about the handwritten note. more incident details a photo of the damaged floor from the report The next part of the report included interviews from witnesses. Everybody’s name was redacted. a snippet from an interview A lot is redacted from this paragraph, but this is the first interview that gave me some information on who had brought the chemicals that had started this fire into WILG. Note that the pronouns here are  , but WILG is a community of women. To my knowledge, the only man who lived here at any time during the 2020 – 2021 school year was the boyfriend of our GRA (Graduate Resident Advisor). It seems like a woman gave him two jugs of the cleaner that might’ve started the fire. From this report, it isn’t entirely clear who placed the jugs in room 408, although the pronoun  appearing again in the following sentence makes me think it might’ve been the same boyfriend. The night of the fire, both the GRA and her boyfriend had already moved out of WILG. a snippet from a different interview. sometimes there are words sprinkled between all the black boxes! The note reappears here! There is no photo of the note in this report, but it seems like the note was offering the items (like the jugs of cleaner) to the next tenant. the real culprit This photo of the cleaner was included. Apparently it was the hydrogen peroxide that caused the fire. sus They tried to reach out to the company that made this cleaner, Pure Health Products. They even sent a police officer down in Crystal River, Florida, to check it out, but the store front was vacant. and they all lived happily ever after So this incident was classified as accidental and the case was closed. Who started the fire? Well, nobody, in some sense, in that it seems that the cleaner had simply spilled onto the floor. We could assign some blame to the woman who purchased the cleaner, but the entire situation does seem to be accidental (and also her name is redacted in the police report, and while WILG members can piece together from context clues who she is, I’m not going to expose her), or we could assign some blame to the company who made the product, but from the report, there isn’t any evidence that the cleaner was more dangerous than it should’ve been. Maybe this isn’t the most satisfying ending; if this were a mystery novel, readers would hate it. But most of real life happens by chance, just like a fire that requires a simple coincidence to ignite.

I am going to put this together haphazardly, work on it in drips and drabs. This is for people on the fence, for those who aren’t sure what MIT is offering, or if the experience here is worth all the work. This place is hard, in all senses of the word. It cuts you to the quick. But it can be lovely, too. When I first thought of this blog, it was to have the title  You Knew What MIT Would Be,  and it was going to be about how you predicted many of the pitfalls of this place. It would be about how you  knew  you would go months without writing creatively, weeks without reading novels; how you chose this because MIT would force you to learn science, to achieve the kind of competence you’d always desired. How you needn’t have wondered what MIT would make of you. You knew. But the more I think on it, the more I realize I had no idea. There are so many faces to this place, spaces and secrets I didn’t know I’d crave.  You do read, actually. Articles. You are assigned, on average, seven articles per week, and something like eight chapter books this semester: four dystopian sci-fi and four Roman classics. The articles are all wholly interesting, though many could be less verbose. They are mostly about race, gender, and the environment, and marginalized voices in sci-fi/fantasy, and the importance of story. On good weeks you read seven abstracts, and three or maybe four full articles. On busier weeks you read titles on the way to class. You are taking three
 
HASS ⁠ 01 humanities I read the blogs my senior year of high school, saw that every blogger seemed to have at least one post where they were hosed and hating this place. But I, too, was tired; I thought they felt like I did. I didn’t realize how exhausted you could be. There are weeks when you tally up your work, the hours in a day, and realize that it’s Monday and the next night you’ll get eight hours to sleep is probably Sunday. Saturday if you go to bed early. But if you skip reading an article you can nap in the Banana Lounge for an hour before class. Everyone is busy, but everyone understands that everyone is busy, and people still choose to prioritize people, hang out until late even though they have class the next day. Even so sometimes this place feels fraught, all of us one or two days from a deadline, scrambling to finish on time. Parts of MIT are wonderful in this distinctly MIT way. I wandered through the Media Lab proper some nights ago, peeked through the glass windows into makerspaces with devices of bright silicon and taffeta, projects I understood neither the mechanism nor the use for. Some were moving gently. It was bizarre, sort of otherworldly, though that could have been the hour. I wandered all of the second and third floors and could not find the kitchenette where I remembered getting free coffee every time someone took me there. It was different from the makerspace I just got access to, IDC, where there’s an embroidery machine and a giant glass box full of sand, and a fume hood where they test low-tech stoves. The instructor kept offering trainings, and to supply new materials. We talked about a project on a whim, and planned to meet again. Different, also, is MITERS, where there are shopping carts with electric motors hanging from the ceiling, a lathe that runs on a car battery, old tools piled high on the shelves. The place smells of metal shavings, and I rarely manage to leave without machine oil or grease on my hands.  All of these, though, are MIT. There are so many facets of this school. And there is an openness here, a freedom to learn, to try new things, get trained on machines you didn’t know the name of before. There’s a sense that you can do anything, if you put in the time. Dig up the right grants, and you can even get funding for it.  I didn’t know I’d crave these spaces when I applied to MIT. It would take me a year to realize I liked building things more than I liked chemistry, and another year to feel at home in machine shops. And there is so much more to learn, so many projects to struggle through, and only two more years to do so. I remember distinctly thinking I did not want a school to make me. I didn’t want my identity to be tied to any school, let alone a dorm within it. Three years ago I was eating cookies at a midnight gay cookie event on 41W at East Campus, admiring the fact that undergrads stayed up
 
so late ⁠ 02 so terribly late! It was midnight. The beginning of my sophomore year, I came onto EC thinking of how I wanted to become an EC resident, someone who built stuff on a whim, painted murals on the walls, who knew how to spin fire. Someone full of all the secrets of this place. I haven’t become all of that. My walls are only halfway painted. But I’ve eaten only free food this week, a feat any EC resident would be proud of, and I know the tunnels well enough that underground routes are faster than the Infinite. There’s a lyra hanging in my room which I made and which MIT paid for.  At CPW, I felt that I’d become more of what I wanted to be — not my senior year of high school, maybe, I don’t think she knew exactly what she wanted. But she would become freshman me, who wanted to be something more, something I’m still striving for. So replace writing with any type of art, building things with the particular science that speaks to you. The decision isn’t easy, and it isn’t necessarily inevitable.  MIT isn’t perfect for everyone. It’s only paradise some of the time.  I chose it because it would force me to grow in ways I didn’t know how to grow alone. I  could  scale back on classes, pull myself off campus, hole up in cafes and write — and sometimes I wish I did more of that. But I don’t regret the things I’ve learned here, the skills I’ve gained, which I wouldn’t have seen the joy of at any other place. ##decisions are hard #East Campus #IHTFP

one of the things i’m working on outside of class this semester is a zero-knowledge cryptography project with 0xparc, a crypto research organization. i got involved with 0xparc because it’s actually led by an mit undergrad; you can read more about the group on  their website . my project is to produce a zk-snark implementation of an elliptic curve pairing; those words probably don’t make much sense to you, so here’s a short (hopefully) beginner-friendly crash course on what’s going on, explained using as little math as possible zero-knowledge proofs a  zero-knowledge proof  is essentially when you want to prove something about an object without revealing any other information about the object. for example: i want to prove to you that my friend is 21 years old without revealing their name or drivers license or other personal information i want to prove to you that i know the password to an account without revealing the password i want to prove to you that i took a photo with a famous celebrity without showing you the photo at first glance you might think these kinds of proofs are impossible, but when conducted in the right setting with the right assumptions they can actually be mass-produced. here are two examples of zero-knowledge proofs:  my friend is red-green color-blind. i have a red ball and a green ball that are otherwise identical, and i want to prove to my friend that the balls have different colors proof: i give both balls to my friend, one in each hand, leave the room, and give them the option to either swap the balls or keep them in place. then i re-enter the room and tell my friend whether the balls were swapped or not. we repeat this process as many times as necessary until my friend is convinced that the balls have different colors the point here is that for me to keep telling my friend whether the balls were swapped or not, i must have a reliable way of distinguishing the two balls, so if i eg. answer correctly 100 times in a row then my friend can be pretty confident the balls have different colors, since the probability of me guessing correctly 100 times is basically zero here are some examples of arguments that don’t work: we could convince my friend the balls have different colors by asking a bunch of people what the color of each ball is to get a consensus, or we could take pictures of the balls and examine the rgb pixel values, but these procedures aren’t zero-knowledge because my friend learns the color of each ball in the process i want to prove to my friend that two entrances to a building are connected proof: i walk in via the first entrance and exit via the second entrance, while my friend watches from outside again, note that letting my friend walk through the building themselves or showing them the building floor plans or etc. wouldn’t be zero-knowledge proofs, since they reveal information about the interior structure of the building these are two relatively simple examples of zero-knowledge protocols; with more complicated schemes it’s possible to prove a wide variety of claims in zero knowledge (the technical formulation is that any statement in np can be proven). you can imagine how, instead of proofs about balls and colors or entrances and building layouts, we might care about zero-knowledge proofs involving more important objects like passwords or identities or bank accounts. so it shouldn’t be surprising that many of the authentication and authorization schemes keeping the internet secure are actually zero-knowledge proofs of sorts. if you want to continue learning about these topics with more mathematical context i recommend  this blog post  zk-snarks zk-snark  stands for  zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge . the  zero-knowledge… argument of knowledge  part basically just refers to zero-knowledge proofs from the previous section, so the only new qualifiers here are  succinct  and  non-interactive succinct  here means that the proof takes a constant amount of space. for instance, the ball color example from the previous section is not succinct, since depending on how skeptical the verifier is, they might ask to repeat the swapping procedure 10, 100, or 1000 times before they are fully convinced that the balls have different colors, so a record of the proof might end up being arbitrarily long. by contrast, the building entrance example is clearly succinct non-interactive  means that the proof procedure doesn’t require any intermediate input from the verifier. once again, the ball color example isn’t non-interactive, since at each step the verifier decides whether to swap the balls or not and whether to enter another round or not, while the building entrance example is in fact non-interactive so, putting all of that together, a zk-snark is a succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. the most important property of zk-snarks is the following: for any function f that has a finite representation in terms of the basic arithmetic operations, and any desired target output y, there is a zk-snark proving that f(x)=y. or, to put it differently, i can take any finite function f, a secret input x, a public output y, and produce a zero-knowledge proof that f(x)=y without revealing x, and the proof will take up constant space regardless of how complex f is. this fact took me a day to wrap my head around the first time i saw it; it simply makes no sense that this is possible, using constant space, for arbitrary functions f! but cryptography is filled with results that seem absurd at first glance and obvious in hindsight, so you get used to the feeling after a while why is this important? well, many cryptography algorithms (like  rsa  and  bls ) make use of a private key x and a public key y. for instance, in rsa encryption, the private key is basically a password you keep to yourself that lets you decrypt messages intended for you, while the public key is shared with everyone else and is used by other people to encrypt messages they want to send to you. this setup ensures that if someone else on the internet intercepts an encrypted message intended for you, they won’t be able to decrypt it since they won’t know your private key this also means that ownership of a private key is essentially the same as ownership of an internet identity. since private keys x and public keys y are usually related by some function f with f(x)=y (f is the function used to generate the public key from the private key), if you can put the function f inside a zk-snark then you can use the zk-snark to produce a zero-knowledge proof that you own the private key corresponding to a public key. in other words, you can create zero-knowledge proofs for ownership of digital identity if you want to learn more about how zk-snarks actually work,  this blog post  is pretty good  zk identity in the previous two sections i introduced zero-knowledge proofs and then talked about how zk-snarks enable zero-knowledge proofs of digital identity. this might not seem very exciting by itself, and indeed it’s true that proof-of-identity on its own doesn’t do much. the interesting applications come from mixing proof-of-identity with existing real-world identities. for instance:  you can use proof-of-identity to manufacture anonymity within a group. many members of social groups are afraid of voicing dissenting opinions, the us senate being perhaps the most frustrating example. proof-of-identity could eg. allow a senator to post an anonymous opinion along with a proof that they are one of the 100 us senators, while revealing no knowledge about which senator they are. this is different from a senator giving an anonymous interview to a news reporter because there is real credibility here – we can mathematically guarantee that the anonymous opinion comes from a senator while ensuring it is cryptographically impossible to figure out which senator voiced the opinion. (by contrast, in the anonymous interview scenario, readers don’t know if the reporter is just be making up a story, and senators may be reluctant to conduct an interview because of the potential for identity leakage) on the flip side, you can use proof-of-identity to give credibility to an anonymous voice. eg. maybe an author wants to try experimenting with a new writing style, but they don’t want it associated with their name because they’re unsure how it will be received, so they share it anonymously but attach a zero-knowledge proof that the author has published before or has sold some number of books in the past, so that readers take the anonymous piece more seriously proof-of-identity can be used to prove an identity is consistent as well. for instance, maybe i want to buy asset 1 from marketplace 1 and asset 2 on marketplace 2, and i want people on marketplace 1 and marketplace 2 to know that i own both asset 1 and asset 2 (eg. i bought peanut butter and jelly from separate vendors to get better deals, but want to prove that i can make a peanut butter jelly sandwich). if marketplace 1 lets you import data from your marketplace 2 account or vice versa then this is easy, but these integrations may not always exist. in this case you can create a shared private key and sign the transactions for both marketplaces with the same private key to prove that the people executing both transactions share the same identity. the more general pattern is that you can show a series of actions performed by different accounts on unrelated platforms was performed by a consistent identity, without revealing your real-world identity of course there is potential for abuse here. for instance, in the first two examples, someone could use proof-of-identity to make harmful statements anonymously while backing up those statements with status. i’m not trying to argue that proof-of-identity will be a digital panacea, but rather that it opens up more flexible ways of thinking about identity and privacy that aren’t currently possible  what i actually work on now that i’ve explained zero-knowledge proofs, zk-snarks, and zk identity, we finally have all the pieces necessary to understand what i actually work on in section ii i mentioned that, for any function f defined in terms of basic arithmetic operations, it is possible to create a zk-snark which proves f(x)=y. basically every function of interest can be written in this form, and there are actually programming languages where you write some code to define the function f, run it on some inputs, and transform that function call into a proof that other people can verify. in my case, the group i work with uses the  circom language . technically it’s a circuit design language, but writing circom really feels like writing regular code. for example, if i want to create a zero-knowledge proof that two numbers a and b multiply to 24, i can just write the following circom code:  template CheckSum() {     signal input a;     signal input b;     a*b === 24; } then i compile the code and let the user feed in inputs a and b. if a and b multiply to 24, a zero-knowledge proof is generated; if not, an error is returned. as you might imagine, for more complicated functions we write significantly longer programs (the largest circuit from my project contains 19 million constraints), but the overall process is the same to actually create all the proof-of-identity applications from section iii, we need to first implement the relevant cryptography protocols as circuits in circom; zk-snarks are a relatively new topic, so many standard libraries and algorithms have yet to be implemented, and this is one of the major bottlenecks in the development of applications that use zero-knowledge technology. in my case, i’m working on the  bls digital signature scheme  which allows someone to sign a message and then have other people verify that the signature is valid. the bls signature scheme relies on a math function called an  elliptic curve pairing  which is too complicated to explain here, though if you’re interested there is an  mit class on elliptic curves  that touches on pairings. so my work consisted of first reading math to understand elliptic curve pairings (this took a few weeks), then writing out the circom code to produce the actual proofs (this took a few months), and now creating some demos and writeups for public consumption (this is still ongoing)  other thoughts there’s no guarantee that zero-knowledge technology will become widespread in the future, or that any of the proof-of-identity applications i mentioned in section iii will ever be widely used. this work is all being done in a relatively niche corner of the internet, and it might be too technical for the general public to ever understand why this stuff is promising. but i’ve enjoyed my work in spite of these uncertainties – it’s been a really fun way to learn about cryptography and work on math that i otherwise would never have touched one of the more compelling arguments i’ve heard for working on zero-knowledge tech is the following: we are by default headed towards a world where governments and corporations perform mass surveillance and collect large amounts of data that is then stored in centralized databases; this data is often handled carelessly and always runs the risk of being hacked or leaked, leading to scams, identity theft, and breakdowns in privacy. we have seen in the past few decades that legislation and reform will not stop these trends- governments benefit from such surveillance, and large corporations probably won’t really be held accountable for data malpractices because they provide invaluable services that can’t be replaced easily. however, if we can find ways to replace as much authentication on the internet as possible with zero-knowledge protocols, we may be able to shift the world towards futures where the potential impact of data malpractice is reduced (eg. if you’re using zero-knowledge proofs for authentication then hackers can’t steal your login info from a server, because the server never had access to your login info to begin with) usually, when people suggest fighting tech with more tech like i did in the previous paragraph, my initial instinct is one of skepticism. attempts to fight fire with fire go poorly more often than they succeed. this case is no different – i’d prefer if there were solutions to data insecurity other than building a new layer of tech to move everything onto; i just haven’t heard of any good ones. but it’s also true that the entire history of cryptography is an ever-escalating fight between new protocols and new exploits, so it makes sense that this field in particular might be an exception to the rule

Today, I woke up and walked to Trader Joe’s. The elevator was taking a particularly long time, so I opted to walk down eight flights of stairs. The air that encompasses the staircase is hot and inky, and so I walk as fast as I can, my feet barely grazing every second stair. The door on the first floor of the tower sounds an alarm, so I exit the stairs on the second floor and walk through the lobby. I could’ve waited until the shuttle was operating, but I enjoy the walk, mostly because I enjoy the things I will see. I especially like the houses on Granite Street. I like their steel blue facades and open porches. I like their carefully pruned flowers and walkways warped by the overgrown roots of trees. I like their windows, and how their tenets leave them open. I like the house at the intersection of Granite Street and Rockingham Street. I like how it is cornered against a baseball field, where the local children play. When I walk past that house, I feel an overwhelming yearning for domesticity. For matrimony. For a car that is safe and reliable. For a sidewalk covered in chalk drawings. Then, I feel an overwhelming feeling of nausea. I shake it off. I also enjoy the people. The walk to Trader Joe’s is situated at the midpoint between Boston University and MIT, and just as I pass the boathouse, before I enter Granite Street, there are always students running. They are shirtless, regardless of the weather, and the hems of their shorts sit well above their knees. Sometimes, they gossip as they run. Other times, they are playing music aloud. Those are my favorites, because I can hear them trotting behind me. Soon enough, they will shout “On your left!” or “On your right!” and I will never be able to predict which it will be. So, I cling to whichever edge of the path I choose, and they will either run beside me, or I will receive an elbow to the side. Past the intersection of Granite Street and Rockingham Street, there is Pearl Street, and a woman is sitting on her porch. She is sitting on her knees, like a child, shins pressed against the concrete. She is smoking a Marlboro Red. I can tell without looking, because I remember exactly how they smelled back home. I’d never seen a woman smoke a Marlboro Red. As I walk past her, she waves at me, and so I wave back. I wonder if she waves to every passerby, or just the ones she is curious about, or just me. I wonder if she pities me. I stew on it for the rest of the walk. Granite Street ends abruptly and spills into the Trader Joe’s parking lot like a river spills into a bay. This Trader Joe’s is small, especially in proportion to its massive concrete parking lot, and I am suddenly reminded of California. Wide, barren, concrete. Cars. Little enclaves of carefully curated trees. I am pragmatic in a Trader Joe’s. I know exactly what to buy, and where things are located. I inspect a bag of clementines, knowing that I will have to request the assistance of my roommate to finish them before they rot. I grab the Boursin cheese. I reach for two Honeycrisp apples, but I realize they are too expensive, so I opt for two Fiji apples instead. I turn the corner into the coolers. I find the same selection of microwave meals, which I will eat on the days I nap through dinner. I grab two bags of freeze-dried strawberries. One bag of popcorn. One bag of tortilla chips. The clerks at Trader Joe’s love to chat. A man gestures to his lane, and I oblige and set my basket on the counter. He asks me how I am. I say I’m doing well. I ask him how he is. He says he can’t complain. I start to bag my groceries. The heavier items go into my backpack, while the lighter ones go into a reusable bag. He finishes scanning the items faster than I can finish bagging them, so he watches me as I clumsily shove the remaining bag of strawberries and the bag of popcorn into the reusable bag. As I pay, he asks me what school I go to. I tell him I go to Boston College. I do that when I’m feeling a certain way. I casually lie to strangers. Last week, I told my barber I was an anthropology major. What would anybody know. Sometimes the truth feels too tiresome to explain. As I’m putting my card away, I notice the CSAIL lanyard hanging from my pocket. I shove all of the lanyard back inside and leave with my backpack and bag. I should’ve said I went to Boston University, because Boston College is so far. If he’s wondering, I could just say that I’m visiting a friend at MIT, and the friend works with CSAIL, hence the lanyard. Of course, he’s not wondering. He’s bagging the next person’s groceries. Perhaps this person will say that they go to Boston College, and they won’t be lying. I take the identical walk back from Trader Joe’s to my room. Everything looks drastically different when going the opposite way. Now, the Granite Street houses are on my left, and I pray that the woman with the Marlboro Red went inside. She did. I can see the city across the river, and it looks different than it does at night. It looks sober. Corporate. The river looks still. When I get back to my room, I realize that only an hour has passed. I feel different from how I felt when I left, as if I’d seen something life altering. Of course, I didn’t. I just went to Trader Joe’s. I sit on my bed and record an audio of myself speaking, which I’ve been doing in lieu of writing lately. I speak about the houses, about the children playing in the field, about the Marlboro Reds, about the expensive apples, about the city, about my lying. Then, I Google search where Boston College is actually located. Newton. Then, I search if there is a Trader Joe’s in Newton. There isn’t. It wasn’t too egregious of a lie after all. Edit 4/25/2022: There is a Trader Joe’s in West Newton.

on thursday morning, i woke up at 9 am, after only six hours of sleep, and i felt awful. my throat was sore, i simultaneously felt hot and cold, and mucus discharged from my faucet of a nose. unsurprising, given what i started feeling the night before. i reported the symptoms on covid pass and started rifling through my emails. i thought,   i only had one class, and it was 6.UAT Oral Communication, from 11 am to noon. the other class i usually went to on thursdays, 6.033 Computer Systems Engineering, had canceled recitations for the day. it would be a flagrant violation of rules to attend class, and a bad idea anyway. i checked the 6.UAT website for course policy on missing class, then i emailed the teaching assistant saying i’d be absent. i ordered takeout online from clover, then went to medical and got tested for covid again. it was a struggle walking outside, even if it was a fine spring day; it made me wonder how i could’ve gotten tested for covid if i felt too sick to move. i cleared my schedule for the day—not that there was anything, mind you—and was left listless. what did people do when they were sick? i legitimately didn’t know, as i haven’t had to miss school due to illness since five years ago. sure, i’ve been sick between.  from time to time, i get acute vertigo spend time in bed make themselves soup or tea go to a medlink go to mit medical email s3, student support services without anything else to do, i tried to do what i always did when i had free time: work. i checked my list of homework deadlines, but none were due for a week and a half. so i tried to work on some projects i had due end-of-semester. but of the four (yes, four, it’s ridiculous) projects i had, three were group projects, and i was blocked on my teammates. that left the one project for 6.004 Computation Structures. i didn’t   to work too hard on this project; i just had to get a decent score in the last exam and i’d get a B in the class. but i wanted an A, so i at least had to put some amount of effort into the project. when i opened the project and tried working on it, my mental energy evaporated after half an hour. that was out. i decided to catch up on watching anime. i finished the first season of the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya, a 2006 sci fi comedy. (no spoilers, don’t worry.) one of the themes that stood out to me was that of nihilism. it’s never outright stated, but the way haruhi flits between activity to activity strikes me as someone who views life so… trivially. perhaps her thrill-seeking should be viewed as bargaining, a plea to the gods for a meaningful life, after realizing that she isn’t living one. i took a nap. well, it wasn’t a nap, because i slept for three hours. when i woke up, i saw it was nine pm, and then i slept even more. i woke up friday morning, still feeling sick. a notification on my phone tells me i tested negative. i email our tutorial instructor for 6.033, saying that i have to miss class. i message my teammates for 6.033, relaying my preparations for today’s class. i scrounge myself food. i watch more haruhi suzumiya, this time finishing season 2. this sounds like a lot of episodes, but i skipped four out of fourteen. the second season of haruhi is notorious for its  endless eight while i could certainly pull out my media studies glasses on the endless eight, and haruhi suzumiya in general, i will  leave it to others by friday afternoon i was feeling much better. the only symptom left was a runny nose, but i had otherwise felt fine. still, was it already okay for me to start going to things, now that i was feeling better? it’s weird, being in isolation, when it’s self-imposed. all the guidelines told you what to do if you tested positive for covid, but nothing when you test negative. i don’t know how much people mind being around someone who is/was sick. what if i no longer had symptoms, but they only disappeared an hour ago? what if i’m completely normal except i cough every ten minutes? even if i did go outside, of   i’d wear a mask everywhere for a few days, but… still, did people mind? it wasn’t covid. but maybe i wanted it to be covid, if only so i knew what to do. maybe i wanted it to be something worse, so i could take a break from… from what? it’s not as if i had work that i was avoiding anyway. maybe the worst part of it all is that i feel guilty for not doing work with all the free time i had. or that, now that i’m feeling better, i’m still not doing work; i’m going to watch the haruhi suzumiya movie, and then i might do some more writing, or play slay the spire, or whatever. what kind of a world do i live in, where i feel like i have to do work on a sick day?

This semester, I decided to take 21W.762 Poetry Workshop taught by Ed Barrett. I’ve always wanted to learn how to write poetry, being too afraid to really just dive into it since it felt cringey or awkward. This workshop has taught me to really lean into those feelings and that discomfort and so I have decided to share my (bad) poetry and my peers’ (good) poetry with the blogs. I love writing about and highlighting the humanities classes I’ve taken here at MIT and 21W.762 is no exception. It’s a great class that’s showed me how to be more comfortable with my writing and take more risks. Though my poetry isn’t good by any means, I thought it would be fun to share some with you. I asked the class to submit poems if they wanted to be featured and I got some poems in response! I absolutely adore everyone’s writing and everyone in the class is super, super talented and inspirational. I hope to write like them someday. The poems below are in the format of   by Author (poetry form)  by Alisa Hathaway (Blazon)  by Cami Mejia (Prose)  by Cami Mejia (Triversen)  by Cami Mejia (Sestina)  by Dien Nguyen (New Form) by Dien Nguyen (Blazon) by Leela Fredlund (Sestina)  by Leela Fredlund (Prose)  by Alisa Hathaway (Blazon) my room contains a giant looking glass of a closet every glance, i notice oddities and peculiarities that i have never seen before, amidst staring at my reflection for 21 years. it’s quite easy to stare at myself and ramble off changes i wish i could make the biggest: the strange shape of my two eyebrows. both caterpillars — one ready to metamorphose into a butterfly the other ready to cocoon for the rest of time. i stare at my hands, crackling from efforts to cleanse myself of burdens they lead to my arms which are sticks unable to carry weight dumped on me shouldn’t have skipped arm day everyday last year. i run my tongue along my slimy, chalky teeth the more I brush and poke and evaluate, the more the mirror starts growing into me. Let me out Let me out Let me out i bang my head against the mirror, again & again & again I awaken, enclosed in a kaleidoscope of shattered glass A new bruise! The lined purple black conglomeration used to worry me — just like overnight oats they absorb and shift and blossom in such a short period of time. Now, I see that my skin is capable of change Through a crooked angle I spy my scrawny arm, as pale as ever. I stare into this broken reflection & think of how my arm is not strong, it will never be the biggest or best or bulkiest but it does give out wonderful hugs I stare at my peeling hands and chipped fingernails in disgust, and melodies and soothing piano sounds come flowing out. And my teeth! They are not organized in perfect rows after 5 years of metal torture but they give away smiles asking for nothing in return. Through the looking glass I begin to see what lies underneath my clothes underneath my skin. My lungs that breathe air as I hike over mountains, swim through fjords, dance with my best friend. My heart that feels love and pain and heals and provides to anyone in need. My brain that learns and matures and dreams and realizes that there is so much more to me than the surface. by Cami Mejia (Prose) It is pain, as you see him collapse. His body struck and skewered, limp and lifeless, donning  your very armor. It’s the closing of your throat, raw and rough with your screams and cries. The  saliva that pools in the back seems to drown you. It’s your vision blurring, hot with tears as the  salt stings in your eyes and you grasp onto anything to ground you. I’m sick with longing for you. There is no more shattering blow that I could suffer. It is rage. It sits deep in your belly with the hollow thrum in your chest as you crack and crunch  and kill and break, your splintered pieces embedding themselves deep into the hearts of those  who have wronged you, as their bodies collapse to the ground and a deep red blankets your  feet. There is no amount of death that can avenge him. It is triumph. The feeling that fills you now, glowing in your chest and shining bright on your  battlefield. No one dares to approach you, as you wear the stains of roses like badges on your  dirtied skin. Come, friend, you too must die. It is agony. It is the slice to your heel that causes your collapse. Oh, how your rage carried you  so far but not far enough. The sweet taste of victory, gone now from your lips as the blood pools  in your mouth. How you die with a smile on your face at the thought of being with him once  more. Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles, murderous,  doomed. It is love. It escapes your mouth in your final breath as your body slips to the other side, as your  ghost dances pretty on the battered battlefield in search of your lover. It wraps your corpse in an  embrace, finally settling your pain and your rage, your triumph and agony, and leading you to  him. Never bury my bones apart from yours, Achilles, let them lie together…just as we grew up  together in your house. ⁠ 01 When I don't know what to write about, I write about my favorite media. I remember there was a TikTok artist that blew up with a song and she said that when she wrote it, she pretended she was Bella from Twilight. This was (obviously) inspired by The Song of Achilles. I think about that book daily and I really just wanted to write a poem about Patroclus and Achilles because I think their story is heartwrenching and memorable and it's stuck with me for a while. I don't think this poem does the book justice, nor will I ever get to the point where my writing does, but I just wanted to have a nice little ode to them.  by Cami Mejia (Triversen) my father knows nothing about me, or my hopes and dreams, my wishes and desires. i feel like for a man who has raised me for twenty years we should know each other somehow. but all i see when i look at him is a stranger that i share in nothing with, but dna, double helices tethered to me. i am too afraid of what will happen, so much so that i refuse to sever it, no matter how it frays at its seams or droops in the middle. because at the end of the day i am his flesh, i am his blood, i am his offspring. and while i say desperately, loudly, “blood doesnt mean shit, blood doesnt mean shit,” i still take the string, worn and tired, in my hands, and hold it together. ⁠ 02 I always joked about how this class was going to be me writing angsty poetry about my relationship with my dad every week, but surprisingly this is the only angsty piece of poetry I have about my dad. It was healing to write, but I think this poem is definitely so surface level and obvious and just so overdone/trite that I'm kind of disappointed with how it turned out. The phrase 'blood doesn't mean shit' is one I borrowed from my ex boyfriend, who used to say it a lot when I would feel bad about disliking my dad sometimes. It was comforting to hear. by Cami Mejia (Sestina) To have and to hold, as you carve my heart out so carefully and delicately, taking the organ from my corpse with bloody, bloody red dripping down. I feel it: desire. Like the moon to the wolf, instinct overtakes me, this raw feeling. As you lap up what is left, I am swallowed up in you. I fear you consume me, body and soul, addictive and raw like nicotine In my veins. Sweet, sweet nicotine. I take a drag from my lips and puff out smoke, feel it flow to my heart, but as I close my eyes I see it, not you, and fear strikes again. The black behind my eyelids transforms into its corpse. It lays there, still, eyes open and empty, devoid of all feeling. And yet I see you in the back, looming over it, your body painted with desire. How? How is it in all of this you still feel this ache, this burn, this desire? This perverted want to be my addiction, to be my nicotine? Do you yourself know what it is? This grand complex you’re feeling? Not just the sex, not just the lust, but that   that pinches at your heart. That causes it to beat a little faster, that breathes life into your walking corpse. You know what it is, and it’s exactly what you fear. And for your whole life, that’s what has colored your every moment: fear. To drown it all out, you throw yourself into the pleasures of it all, feeding into your own desire. And when it’s not enough, you shove it all down by picking apart at the corpse. By thumbing at the bullet holes and swallowing your pills and inhaling your nicotine. It’s your tactic to mute it so that one day your beating heart will still and you, too, will become nothing, numb to the feeling. But as long as I am here, you can’t escape it, you can’t run from what you’re feeling. And though it paralyzes you, that fear, I will be here through it all. So eat my heart out if you need it, tease me, ravage me, undo me completely if it’s what you so desire. Drag it out, long and slow, taste it on my tongue, that nicotine, until it’s all left behind: the dread, the killing, the corpse. Take all that you need of me until I am nothing left, a corpse of a man that you once loved, that gave you feeling, that sucked on your shaking fingers, stained with nicotine, and kissed you so hard as to swallow your fear and put there in its stead desire, and took your hand and placed it on my beating heart. Call it what it is, (love), let me be your nicotine no longer, nor your plaything, nor your corpse. Call it what it is, (love), let me the reason your heart beats, the thing that gives you feeling. Call it what it is, love. Let me quiet your fear and be the man that breaks your resolve, that lets you tap into that desire.

This poem was really hard for me to write and I definitely need to practice writing sestinas because the best written sestinas are the ones in which you can't tell there's an intended form, whereas this one it's pretty blatant and clunky.

Things meant to  be consumed proclaim, “I see the day I poison myself.” But dates are like dogs, all backwards in the mirror. It’s the same immutability which means numbers don’t slip; it’s the same adage which always makes water thinner than blood. When I was young I needed blood to fill the whiteness clinging to my gum. Ten months was too small for the white to stay on the hospital slip, twenty IVs, and a suckling bottle. All the faces staring through a one-way mirror, a circus, just for me to not recognize myself. I wish they knew I  wasn’t not yet, with quiet veins of watered blood. And that a puddle of tears reflecting doesn’t make a saltwater mirror any more than testing little fingers stealing my mother’s gum was a blind leap off a cliff that led to the bottle. For just because I stumble doesn’t mean I will slip. My first poem was goldfish stuffed into a slip. It was my handwriting, but I didn’t peel myself as though my pen could stab my heart into a bottle, as though the ink staining her fingers was my blood. I wanted it to dye, forever in her hair like gum; I wanted her to cut it and see me in the mirror. I’ve loved again since, fought my blush in the mirror, but I’ve held lye too and known everything will slip. They say it takes seven years to let go of gum, but  I Oak-barrels aren’t my skin, nor teeth-staining wine my blood. Oh, to live life a maple, and be drained into a bottle. Does a sailor think less of her skill because her ship is in a bottle? No; so too can my laser eyes see through my clothes in the mirror, now see past the paper to the stolen blood. But it  is I’m no longer the folded Post-It girl; I KNOW MYSELF, even if it means plugging the holes in my heart with gum.

Moments are better than minutes for the real cartographer, meaning captured in a snow-globe screenshot, a cell, if you will. How many moments—sobbing, leaking, mascara-running moments, laughing, bubbling, swing-set moments, first smiles and last breaths—have those cells drifted into? I’m sure that everybody who’s ever ached their neck searching the sky wished their mirrors as black as forever and wished for a Newton (or even a Galileo; we settle for human gods) behind their shoulder (pointing, what else) has known in their soul that we are stardust, and so we will return (etc.), but we make constellations from light; we don’t believe in path-independnece. The moments our cells drift through silverly before they are vacuumed into an eternal loneliness are all we have left when Galileo joins us (nevermind the church; surely the Gods aren’t path-independent either). Inkblots are out of fashion, so I’ve been told, but even with your eyes closed you must see some destination—your chair, her bed, Mamma’s kitchen (maybe not a sight, but a sound, feeling, smell—Venn diagrams of ways to measure moments. Eureka! Archimedes would be proud.) Wind whips because it stings to know you can’t control the in-betweens, and like water bubbling onto the crusted stove, residue is turbulent. Argus, with his thousand searching eyes, could never see more than the made-to-die straw wrapper—stardust, reflecting light—that floats an inch further into the unknown each day, a free-falling Magellan even Galileo must envy.

At MIT, students are able to declare their major starting sometime during the spring term of their freshman year. I’m a fairly decisive person when it come to what I want to do, so I was dead confident that nothing was going to keep me from declaring  
6-9. ⁠ 01 Computation and Cognition. MIT  Course 6-9 description As human brains increasingly interact with technology that mimics their own capabilities, the need for students to understand both the science and engineering of intelligence continues to grow as well. Addressing these challenges will require a deeper understanding of how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines. 6-9 is an interdisciplinary major between the Course 6 (Electrical Engineering + Computer Science) and Course 9 (Brain + Cognitive Sciences) departments. I think artificial intelligence is cool, and I think brains are cool. Declaring 6-9 would be ✨perfect✨ for what I wanted. When my student advisor suggested taking 9.00—Introduction to Psychological Science—to figure out whether I wanted to do 6-9 or  
6-3, ⁠ 02 Computer Science and Engineering 
HASS ⁠ 03 Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. All MIT undergraduates need to complete the HASS requirement, which is made up of eight subjects of at least nine units each. I like 9.00 a lot! It’s no surprise, since I like learning about ~brain things~ and there was a time when I thought that I was going to go into neuroscience. But I was becoming a little more unsure about majoring in 6-9. Wasn’t really sure why I was feeling that way, since the obvious option is to major in something I liked to learn about. It wasn’t until I came across  this article by  Possible answer: At some point, I found the intricacies of   more interesting than  , and the same goes for   and  Not that I hate humans or anything. Even though there doesn’t seem to be a big difference between 6-9 and the proposed Artificial Intelligence + Decision-making curriculum, the quote below addresses a subtle one, and that was creating the ambivalent feelings I had. Though 6-4 may seem similar to 6-9, Kaelbling noted that their fundamental difference is that 6-4 is related to AI, whereas 6-9 is related to humans.  It’s still going through the approval process, so it wasn’t included in the Choice of Major form that my advisors sent me a few days ago. Fingers crossed that it gets approved. In the meantime, I officially declared 6-3 so I could get a Course 6 advisor. Even though I could’ve also declared 6-9 and then switch my major later, I think my interests overall have drifted away from 6-9 and closer to 6-3 if I had to choose between those two majors alone. I think both majors are really neat,  
and I’d be alright with either one. ⁠ 04 I'm not considering being a double major at the moment, but that's also an option. my preferences and interests have changed  at MIT and college in general. Maybe I’ll stick with 6-4 if it becomes approved. Or, I might look back on this post someday and be like, “HAHAHA you fool. You seriously thought that you were going to stick with that forever?” And if that happens, then that’s okay, too. But I’m glad that I listened to my student advisor’s advice and took a class to explore possible choices for my major. Also, why am I interested in AI? Because stuff like this can happen.

I live in East Campus, on the third floor of the west parallel, which we call  floorpi This is an old photo. I  once wrote of this room this is a room with a rich history. i can name the past four people who’ve lived in this room. many of the things in this room have been passed down from owner to owner, like the couches, the round table, some of the posters. it’s also right next to the lounge, which is a plus. it’s an extremely nice room and i’m very glad that i live in it. Not only could I name the past four residents; I   them even, and they were my friends. But I’ve always wondered who lived in the room before that. Were there more people I knew, but didn’t realize? Could there be someone like Sal Khan, who used to live in the room of bloggers  Danny and Allan The plan: email each past resident, ask who lived in the room before them, email them, and keep going. The method’s inspired from my time as an
 
ESP historian, ⁠ 01 I have talked about ESP <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/two-thousand-students/">lots of times</a>; we are a student group that runs educational programs for middle and high school students. We have a position called historian whose job it is to do research on ESP history, since ESP is a decades-old organization, and make sure that we leave records of what we currently do. 
in the past, ⁠ 02 See any of my posts where I do history research through interviews, like <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/graphic-identity-history/">my MIT graphic design history post</a>. My quest to trace the past residents of my room began in early February. The oldest former resident I knew was Jakob W. ’18, whom I messaged asking about who the previous resident was. I got Josh S. ’17, a name I’ve heard before, but not a person I think I’ve met. I looked them up in the  MIT Alumni Directory I basically used the same email for everyone else I emailed. Josh replied after a few days, giving me two more names: Amanda L. ’17 and Joie C. ’17. Joie did not remember, but Amanda did; it was Nathan P. ’15. Nathan gave me Ben Y. ’12, and then Ben didn’t remember who lived before he did. It was a pleasant surprise to learn that several graduates I knew from floorpi lived in my room, but I was kinda sad the trail ran cold so soon. Then, I reached out to the oldest floorpi graduate I knew, Charles T. ’10. This lead to a sidetrack; Charles didn’t remember anyone who lived in the room, but he remembered two people who lived nearby. Neither of the two remembered who lived in the room proper either, but they each gave me names of three more people to ask. I emailed the six people, but this line felt kinda fruitless, so I dropped it for a while. With a spark of inspiration, I looked into our  Athena locker The second was Alex D. ’12, which was a delightful coincidence. I’d seen his name from records of  ESP SIPB Tech Squares Epsilon Theta 
FSILG ⁠ 03 Fraternity, Sorority, and Independent Living Group, which are living groups outside dormitories. The third was Kevin M. PhD ’09. After emailing him, I learned that he didn’t live in H306, but  . M306 was, and still is, the room of floorpi’s Graduate Resident Advisor, or GRA. Formerly known
 
as GRTs, ⁠ 04 The T is for Tutor. You can tell that someone is old if they call them GRTs. Well… kinda old, the name was only changed in 2019. Kevin led me to Jessica K. ’09 and James W. ’06. Jessica also remembered James, but not any further. Now, James didn’t reply for a while. But remember those six people I emailed earlier? It turns out that four of them remembered who lived in H306 around their time, a certain Shankar M. ’04. And when James replied to me, he also remembered Shankar M. ’04. Then Shankar led me to Ed T. ’03 and Josh T. ’02. At this point, the graph of connections was already getting quite complicated. I intend to set the record for “most complicated graph in an MIT Admissions blog post” Josh had several interesting things to tell about the room, but he did not remember who lived before him. Then Ed told me he didn’t actually live in the room, but gave me two more names. One didn’t live in the room, but gave me the name Marisa B. ’00, which Ed also gave me. Then I got
 
hosed ⁠ 05 MIT-speak for busy, because getting an education from MIT <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/getting-an-education-from-mit/">is like drinking from a firehose</a>. A few days later, Josh replied after doing some digging of his own: I had a breakthrough on the previous occupant of the room. Digging some more through old files on my hard disk, in my wife’s old email (she also lived on Third West), I found the attached email. You will see that this is dated from the spring of 2000, which would be the semester before I started living in the room. H306 is listed as “Jeanne”, who my wife and I are quite sure is Jeanne S. ’01. I emailed Jeanne S. ’01, who also gave me the name of Marisa B. ’00, along with two more names. I then remembered that I had not actually emailed Marisa yet, so I sent some more emails, and did some more waiting. But it’s with Marisa that the trail ran dry: she didn’t remember who lived before, and neither did anyone else I ask. With that, here’s the final list of residents I compiled:  CJ is, well, me. I’m currently living in the room. I’m majoring in math and computer science.  Andy lives with
 
Epsilon Theta, ⁠ 06 Making Andy and Alex both people who lived in this room for a semester before moving to ET.  Ixa lives off-campus, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He’s also majoring in computer science.  Kevin lives in Austin, Texas. After graduating with a double major in computer science and urban planning, he got a
 
master’s degree ⁠ 07 Per the <a href="https://alum.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2018-04/MITAA_StyleGuide_volunteers_6_20_14.pdf">MIT Alumni Association Editorial Style Guide</a>, and how we sometimes write on the blogs, we write all MIT degrees when referencing alumni. I violate this rule all the time, but sometimes I do it for effect.  Jakob lives in New York City, New York. They majored in math and computer science and did a master’s in the latter. Now, they are a security engineer at Zoom.  Josh lives in the South Bay area of California. He works as a hardware formal verification engineer at Apple; that means his job involves proving, using mathematical tools, that the hardware works as intended.  Amanda lives in San Francisco, California, and Joie lives in Los Angeles, California. Amanda graduated with a computer science degree and a master’s, and is a product designer for Twitch; Joie studied architecture and is now an architect. They are both, coincidentally, pivoting out of software into design.  Nathan lives in the Bay Area of California. He graduated with a degree in math, and is now a self-employed software engineer. He’s currently working on a video game.  Ben lives in the Bay Area of California. He also majored in
 
math and computer science. ⁠ 08 See a pattern yet?  Alex lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He majored in math and computer science and did a master’s in the latter. He works as a systems engineer in Akamai, where he’s worked at since graduating.  Jessica lives in Medford, Massachusetts, which is still in the Cambridge area. She graduated in biological engineering, did a PhD, and is now a scientist at a biotech company.  James lives in Arlington, Massachusetts. He graduated in electrical engineering and did a master’s. He is now an electrical engineer at Cascodium LLC, an engineering design services firm, where he’s worked at since graduating.  Shankar lives in St. Louis, Missouri (with his wife, who also lived in floorpi). He majored in physics and math, and did a PhD in health science. Now, he’s a professor in Washington University’s Departments of Physics and Cell Biology.  Josh lives in Fremont, California (with his wife, who also lived in floorpi). He majored in physics, did a PhD, then a postdoc in CERN. He pivoted into data science, and is now a data scientist at Apple.  Jeanne lives in New York City, New York. She graduated with a degree in management and has worked in JP Morgan since. She now leads the Inclusive Investing Team, which focuses on serving diverse wealth management clients. 
Spring 1998 to Spring 2000: ⁠ 09 …which was before I was even born.  Marisa lives in northern New Jersey. She manages the packaging engineering team at a cosmetics manufacturer. Although my main historical focus was collecting stories about the room, I did learn a few things about floorpi along the way. Here’s one thing I noticed about graduates talking about floorpi. The younger graduates refer to it as floorpi, sometimes “Floor Pi”, while the older ones say “Third West”. People who graduated after 2010 consistently call it floorpi, and the earlier someone graduated, the likelier they are to refer it
 
as Third West. ⁠ 10 Per Jakob, sometimes even "Pi West", as one graduate from 2008 put it. But, per Josh T., it seems to have evolved from Pi West in around 2001. Oldest recorded image of floorpi logo I know of, from 2003. Where did the name floorpi originate? Jeanne S. ’01 shares a story: […I] recently met someone who interviewed to be the GRT on the floor after I had left and asked if I lived on the Simpsons floor (which I did!). At the time, our GRT, Maryann, would open the apartment every Sunday and we would watch Simpsons together. There was usually cookies too. It’s probably the thing I remember most vividly and thought it was so funny this woman I had just met and I had this totally random connection. East Campus has  many murals floor pie scene This is probably one of the oldest murals on hall. It was nice to hear about some things that’ve been passed down through the years. For example, Kevin M. PhD ’09 talked about how, as a GRT, his one rule was “no dying”, which is the origin of the floorpi saying “don’t die on hall”. For an older example, I received a photo from Josh T. ’02, taken by Beth D. ’02, of a “hall feed” with American flag themed cupcakes. A hall feed is an event where people prepare food for the rest of the hall. The phrase dates back to at least 2001, then, when this picture was taken. The term “hall feed” is still used today, in floorpi and other halls in East Campus. Hall feed from 2001, shortly after 9/11. Picture from Beth D. ’02 As for H306 itself, the oldest story I got was from Marisa B. ’00: […W]hen I first moved into the room there was a huge built-in loft that smelled really strongly of cigarette smoke. It was a pretty cool structure and impressively sized, but it was too much for me. I asked facilities to take it down. The room didn’t always have black and red walls. Jessica K. ’09 writes: When I moved in, it was institute white and I decided it would be nice to paint it green, but regretted it almost immediately. I think “pond scum green” might be an accurate description of how it turned out :D Five years later, Amanda L. ’17 and Joie C. ’17 moved into the room, and they repainted the walls from an “icky green/gray to cream and purple”. The room then got another paint job in Fall 2019, when Ixa G. ’22 painted the room with the black and red walls it has now, but traces of the old paint job still remain. For example, the shelves are painted cream and purple, and so is the mirror above the sink. Look, it’s me! I’m smiling. While we’re on the topic of painting, Jessica shared a memory about the door: “I really liked the Myst series of games and painted the room number on the door using a numeral system from those games.” A few years later, Joie shares that she “painted the bare door with Amaterasu and Issun from Okami.” And that’s the mural on the door now. Many doors in East Campus have beautiful murals,  see Nisha’s post Here’s a floor map of my room. I’ll go over everything in a roughly clockwise order from the east wall. Sorry for the potato-quality drawing.  The door is on the east wall of the room. To the left of the door are some shelves, which are painted in the cream-and-purple color scheme that Amanda L. ’17 and Joie C. ’17 left behind. Behind the door is a mirror, which seems to have been there since at least 2012. The over door rack is mine. The backpack is Alan’s, who interrupted me while I worked on this blog post. The furniture to the right of the door is from Jakob W. ’18. The refrigerator was from an upperclassman who graduated. “When she graduated she said she’d gotten [the refrigerator] for free, and I could have it for free, as long as I passed it along for free,” said Jakob. “The hook above the fridge is mine too. It’s the right height for hanging a bicycle using the fridge as a prop to get it up in the air.” They also added the clock above the door, and they acquired an extra dresser to stack on the existing one.  The bed is nestled along the south wall. When Amanda and Joie moved into this room, there was a bunk bed. “Our room [being a double] was weird, I remember people telling us that too,” Amanda said. Being in the top bunk, she disliked having the white shelves above her bed. That means that the white wire rack shelves have been here
 
since at least 2013, ⁠ 11 James W. '06 writes that the racks were there when he moved in, in 2004. “I remember having a Californian friend that was aghast that I had stuff above where I slept,” he said, “because 'what if an earthquake?' ”  Look, it’s Ice Bear, on the bed! Above the bed is a map of the MBTA. I love the MBTA a lot, and Alan Z. ’23 and I once  visited every station on the T “Nubian Sq” The poster to the right is a
 
North Korean leadership chart from 2015. ⁠ 12 I get a lot of questions about this one. It's a great conversation piece.  My favorite part of the room, by far, are the wonderful couches along the west wall. These were left behind by Jakob. “The small couch I bought from
 
someone on 5W ⁠ 13 In many dorms, halls, or wings, are abbreviated with their floor number, followed by W or E for West and East. I know that Baker, East Campus, McCormick, and Next all do this. Burton–Conner's floors are based on Burton and Conner, Macgregor's suites are lettered from A to J, New House houses are either named or take NH plus the house number, Simmons names areas based on A, B, or C tower, and I don't know about Maseeh or New Vassar. Note that the brown couch’s right leg mount is missing. “When I arranged the couches, I forgot to account for the width of the radiator in my planning, so I needed to chop off 6 inches somewhere. [T]he most feasible plan was to disassemble the couch and attach one of its leg mounts to the bed.” That leg mount was
 
crufted ⁠ 14 Thrown away. "Cruft" is also a noun, and a quite versatile one at that: it can be a large piece of trash or an MIT graduate. As a verb, it can mean either thrown away or acquired for free. “Knowledge of the [gray couch]’s storage compartment got passed on right?” asked Jakob. “Mhm,”
 
I replied. ⁠ 15 I later learned that what is pictured below is <em>not</em> what Jakob referred to as the compartment. It’s a hidden compartment! Jakob also provided the flooring. “I bought the blue rug from Home Depot, and the faux wooden flooring from Lowe’s,” they said, “and chopped the [flooring] up on the EC table saw to get the right shape of pieces to fill that room minus couches.” Much of the flooring has detached over the years, but the entrance to the room still has a decent amount of panelling. You can see that the wooden panels stop a few feet into the room.  When Jakob was an undergrad, they were involved with the  Shakespeare Ensemble Musical Theater Guild “The round glass table was a prop in the MIT Shakespeare Ensemble’s 2014 production of Othello, in which I was master carpenter,” said Jakob. “I bought it from the [Ensemble], which had bought it on Craigslist for the show. The wooden town backdrop was one-sixth of the backdrop.” Picture from Jakob W. ’18. On the gray couch are various throw pillows. One features a shark, which is mine. Two of them are references to the musicals Legally Blonde and Little Shop of Horrors. And the various stuffed animals are also mine. The stuffed animals are feeling shy today. “The pillows are from the [Musical Theater Guild’s] 2018 IAP production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” said Jakob. “The audience was in part distributed amongst the stage, and we made a bunch of pillows for them to sit on by sewing and stuffing old MTG shirts.” Picture from Jakob W. ’18.  On the room’s west wall, above the large gray couch, is a window. An LED strip runs along its perimeter. “I bought it on AliExpress,” said Jakob. I’ve never actually seen it work. I had to draw the window shade so the picture wouldn’t be backlit. Posters decorate either side of the window, spilling into the adjacent wall.

The west parallel of East Campus was constructed in 1931, so the room is theoretically ninety-two years old, assuming that nothing’s changed since initial construction. At once, it feels like twenty-four years is a lot. It’s longer than I’ve been here,  as I’m only twenty-one  than everything this room has seen over the period covered by this blog post. And yet, in the scale of the room’s age, twenty-four years is only a quarter of its life. The history I’ve uncovered is only the latest part of its existence, and I’m missing so much. Still, the fact that I’ve managed to go back twenty-four years feels pretty good.  Now that I’m at my fifth history project for the blogs, I’m beginning to think about the means by which I do historical research, and how I present this research to readers. I find myself wanting resources about writing histories that aren’t just “how to write a history essay”, as I’m not trying to answer Big Questions about the past, I’m trying to form a coherent story for What Happened. Where’s the guide that’ll teach me how to ask questions that elicit good historical trivia from respondents? I dunno. For this project, I’ve asked to talk with thirty-six people. My response rate is pretty good, with thirty-three out of the thirty-six responding in some way. One lesson I’ve learned is how responsive people tend to be to email when you ask. Another lesson I’ve learned is that oral history is a fickle thing, with often contradictory information I’ve had to piece together. Also, I wish I took better notes, rather than having to scramble reading emails again. The sources for this project stand in contrast to my previous history projects, which although most had   interviewing part, were mostly grounded in written sources. Doing historical research through talking with people felt more fun, although it took longer and it was more tiring. I’ll probably try to do
 
another oral history project in the future. ⁠ 18 My list of history projects to pursue don't currently have anything that seems like a good fit for oral history, though, so if anyone has ideas, I'm listening.  The thing I’ll remember the most from this project is all the different people I got to talk to. It was like seeing myself in the many different possible futures I   be in, if I went into formal verification, or academia, or systems design, or whatever. I talked to people who’ve worked in the same place for years, and others who are pivoting from one field to another. People who are working in big companies or startups, or are self-employed or in research groups. It made me wish I had the time to meet and talk with them. I knew, in some abstract sense, that graduating from college was a   that people did, and that life after college is a   that exists. But these felt like things that happened to  , and not me. It scared me,  thinking about the future  for me. For this project I interacted with people who, quite literally, were in the same spot I am now. And talking to them, and seeing that they’re all living their lives, gives me hope that maybe my future will end up alright too.  East Campus is going to get renovated soon, and gods know how the floor plan will look like after that. I don’t even know if H306 will be a dorm room a few years down the line, let alone a  . It makes me sad thinking that all the things left behind in this room won’t get passed down to future residents, and will just be… gone. All the effort put into making this room a nice place to live in, and all these hours of memories and stories, replaced with a plain door and spotless walls. Maybe once East Campus is finished with renovations and the undergrads move in again, there’ll be a dorm room on the third floor of the west parallel, whose room number is H306. Maybe future residents of the room, some number of years down the line, will read this post. Maybe one of them will be inspired to paint this room, furnish it, decorate it, and leave something behind. Maybe then, all the effort would’ve been worth it.

the world is ending. ⁠ 01 We thought we were being melodramatic but in retrospect, that world kind of was ending. In some ways, we've been in a very different one ever since. March 12, 2020: After my afternoon classes, I walk into the glass lab for the last time in almost two years to pick up the paperweight I’d made two days before. The paperweight is white, maroon, and teal, designed to be the exact colors of my room in East Campus. At 11 pm we get another text. The timeline has been moved up: now we have only three days to leave. I have three more days to live in my room. I pack my paperweight up very, very carefully. I can’t stay in my room, but at least, just the tiniest bit, I can take it with me. My paperweight in its namesake (name-color?) location. May 12, 2021: One full year into Zoom school. I am taking Poetry Workshop and it is the last week of class. Every other week, we’ve had a prompt for our weekly poem; this week, what we write is up to us. Purely on a whim, with no plan in mind, I find myself writing a poem called “who are you” about all the things that I am. I list out almost all the things that I am, and reach out into myself for any last thing I might have missed. I can’t explain it in words, but I feel my self echo back an image, a glow, a feeling of heat on the hand. I add the line  August 17, 2021: The glassblowing lab announces that they will be reopening in the fall, and have managed to successfully innovate a way to blow glass while wearing a mask. They offer everyone in the Spring 2020 class a spot in the fall 2021 class, no lottery needed. September 27, 2021: Due to an email list mix-up, I accidentally lose my spot in the fall class. I tell myself it doesn’t matter — after all, only luck got me the opportunity in the first place — but I cry a little bit anyway when I mention it on the phone to my parents. February 1, 2022: The glassblowing lab very generously lets me into the spring class. March 2022: I find myself struggling with insecurity. I wrestle with trying to balance the idea that we are all “perfect the way we are” and the idea that we are all imperfect, always improving, trying to make ourselves better. How can both be true? Failing to believe both somehow leaves me believing neither, and I fight with a voice in my brain telling me I’m not good at anything. Several sad things happen at once in my personal life; already feeling low, I spend days trying to see more than just the negatives in myself and my actions. April 11, 2022: I am trying to make a solid blue cup in glassblowing practice session. I gather a glowing ball of clear glass on the end of my pipe and roll the ball through blue-colored glass
 
frit. ⁠ 02 Basically, glass sprinkles. Their small size lets you use them as a coating for solid glass. 
gloryhole, ⁠ 03 The furnace where you reheat your glass, as opposed to the crucible, the furnace where you gather new glass. Yes, it really is called that. Hot glass being rolled through blue frit. Source: https://robbinsranch.com/solid-colors/ As I work it, the cup starts to take shape, forming a beautiful blue — not quite solid, but almost, with a ghostlike pattern that reminds me of the way sunlight veins itself through water. At a key moment in the piece, I suddenly suspect something is wrong. To do the next step correctly, I would have needed to change a previous one. I go ahead anyway. The cup falls off my pipe and breaks all over the floor. I spend the rest of the practice session getting over it. By the end, my deep sadness has faded, out through gentle sadness and into acceptance. I leave the lab with an image of the cup still in my mind.  , I tell myself, and I can feel that I actually believe it. Previous Next April 13, 2022: I go to a Lorde concert. The set is transcendent, and we’re all in the frame of mind to let loud music tell us what to feel. Between crying my eyes out over half the setlist, somewhere in the middle of Liability, I have a revelation on the question I’ve been wrestling with for my whole life (in one sense) and/or for the past month (in another). I scramble to get out my phone and write it down incoherently. I get home from the concert and try to explain it out loud to my partner: “It’s like, the realization… that my first responsibility is to myself. Not myself, but the person that I am, the way that I am now. My second responsibility is to others and that’s important too — I need that too, but it’s pointless if I’m not responsible for myself first.” At the end of all my babble I don’t even know what I’ve said. They tell me: “That makes sense. I understand.” and I appreciate it, but I’m not sure if it’s possible to understand a thing I don’t think I actually said. The set. They changed the lights on each piece/shape of it individually to make the most beautiful geometric displays. April 14, 2022: I wake up with the revelation re-formed in my mind. I don’t know if it makes sense to anyone else, but it suddenly makes sense to me. In my mind’s eye, I see myself, a glowing ball of clear glass. I am not perfect: I can be improved. I can pick up frits of other colors and incorporate them into myself, if I choose to, if the color will look good. And over time, as I make other changes, those colors may melt down and join the ball. But I can’t add new glass and pretend it was there all along. My first responsibility, if I want it, is to protect the glass ball that I am: whole already, needing — and accepting — no alteration. My second responsibility is to try to add new colors, pick up what might be good, help it melt it and join the glass that I have. It is not my job to do the impossible by reaching into the ball and change what’s already at its heart; only to add new layers to the outside, and let time do its job and melt them into the inside. And because of this, I can simultaneously love the glass that I hold now, and the one I will hold in the future. Both of them are me. Both of them good enough.

On April 16th, 2020, my life changed. That’s a kitschy way to put it, because our lives are always changing at every moment, every breath being a cobblestone placed on this path that we follow—but I suppose this day was more memorable than usual, because it’s the day my first novel went to auction. It was a gray day. Most days were gray that month. The pandemic had just begun to claw its way through the United States, and a month earlier, MIT had asked everybody to leave campus, so I was at my boyfriend Chris’s family home in New Jersey. It was just the two of us. We’d been dating for over a year by then, so we should’ve known each other well by this point, but we didn’t. Chris was and is difficult to know well, more so than most people I have met. But now we were binary stars, gravitationally bound to each other, constantly in orbit, trying to survive the most apocalyptic event either of us had ever experienced. I knew the auction was going to happen. I’d spent the last two weeks on various phone calls, talking to editors at publishing houses who were interested in my book. The phone calls were good and to be honest, I would’ve been happy working with any of those editors. They took my manuscript to acquisitions meetings. And then it was the 16th. I was anxious so I took a walk on the gravel trail behind the house. During the walk, an email flew into my inbox. It was my first offer, and it was more money than I’d ever had at any point in my life. I put the offer in my family group chat and everybody was shocked because they didn’t know I could actually make this magnitude of money from writing. Then more offers came in. And then I had decisions to make. I called my parents in a panic because I didn’t know what to do, but they didn’t really know what I should do either, because they knew so little about publishing. Plus, nobody knew how long this pandemic was going to last for, and the economy was steadily nosediving, and I didn’t know what risks were worth taking. Honestly, I was flailing. Chris watched me do a lot of math about the amount of taxes I would have to pay, depending on which offer I chose. This process was not very informative and in retrospect, if I was going to do math, I probably should’ve just done my algebraic combinatorics problem set instead. In some sense, I wish I’d been a little older when this had all happened, or at the very least, I wish I’d had more perspective. Back then, I’d never worked as a software engineer or any other career that usually pays six-figures fresh out of undergrad, nor did I have any faith in myself that I would be able to land such a job, so honestly I was pretty anxious about the offer that had been just placed in front of me because I didn’t know if I’d ever get such an opportunity again. When I was eighteen, I signed a job offer in New Zealand that paid $50,000 a year, and I’d thought that was pretty good, because back in high school, I had tutored kids for $15/hour and I’d thought  that  was pretty good. I’d grown up with the fear that one day I would not have money anymore. In practical senses, I’m grateful for what happened because it gave me the financial privilege to be able to stay in undergrad a little longer and complete the computer science degree I decided to get (along with my math degree). I was and am grateful that so many editors decided to take a chance on me, some college student who honestly didn’t know what she was doing.  I’m also grateful to Chris, because he thought I was cool and my writing was cool from the very first days when we met, long before any of this happened. He held me while I freaked out about what to do, he was the first one I told after I got off the phone with my literary agent after the decision was finally made. When I look back on this day, I feel a lot of tenderness for the girl I was. I wish I’d known what I knew now: that I had a lot more potential than I thought, that if I wanted I could work in tech or finance, that this was only the initial step in a life full of higher stakes and bigger problems, and that this was exciting but so many more things yet to come would also be exciting.

As CPW comes to a close and I watch eager beaver high schoolers drag their far too clunky suitcases onto the airport shuttle, I feel a pang of regret wash over me. New waves of kiddos are coming in to make MIT their own and their home and I continue to trek along my MIT path, closer to the end than I am to the beginning. As I reflect on the fact that I have a little over two semesters left in this school, I wonder what impact I’ve left, if any. I came into MIT thinking I knew some things and knowing I knew not many other things, only to have the rug pulled from under my feet to quickly realize that I don’t know much of anything, really. And from there I wiped off the grime and stood up again, this time a little more wary and a little less
 
cocky. ⁠ 01 To be fair I don't think I was that cocky to begin with, I think I just should've expected to get wrecked more than I initially thought I would. Then I started to pursue computer science thinking I could do it with enough time and effort and boy was I fucking wrong. I spent countless hours on psets and office hours and tutoring only to be greeted by C’s and D’s and F’s. And so I cursed computer science while hissing underneath my breath “I will still study you because I need financial security and I tolerate you but I will not code” and switched to a joint humanities and engineering degree in media studies and computer science. I’ve joined things and left them, repeating this cycle many, many times. I’ve been part of DanceTroupe and The Game Lab and the Education Arcade and the Career and Professional Development office and MIT CodeIt and…god, so many things. And yet I eventually tire and leave them and join new things in hopes of finding something that will click. In my four years here, I’ve joined and left: and a whole slew of other stuff. Nothing has really remained permanent or constant in my time here at MIT except for blogging. Even my major has changed plenty of times, going from
 
20 ⁠ 02 bioengineering 
10B ⁠ 03 chemical engineering 
2A ⁠ 04 mechanical engineering 
6-3 ⁠ 05 computer science 
6-2 ⁠ 06 computer science and electrical engineering 
15-1 ⁠ 07 business management 
21E. ⁠ 08 humanities and engineering While I’ve loved that MIT is so flexible and allows me to jump around so often, I can’t help but feel I’ve thrown away my MIT education in a way, as I shallowly stick my finger into so many different jars, never really committing to just a   thing. I see friends who have so deeply specialized in their field, truly mastering techniques they have been refining since freshman year. When I look at my code and my work, I see only mediocre improvement since then. I feel this especially as I look at my computer science classes. I still heavily lean on Raymond and others to get through my coding assignments and I wonder if I’ve really learned at MIT, or if I’ve only learned how to ask for help. I walk out of MIT with no real discernible skills, only a weird niche microcelebrity scenario through blogging and maybe some cool anecdotes. I have no CAD mechanisms to show you or cool coding projects. I have no papers I’m especially proud of or interesting classes to laud around. I have no research conferences under my belt or shiny start-ups. I’m starting to feel panicked, feeling as if I’ve wasted my three years here. Three years at the top institution in the world and it feels like I’ve made nothing of it. Three years that could have gone to someone else, someone who could have made something of it. It’s been weird, standing at the intersection of media studies and computer science. I feel rendered useless in both, especially having recently dropped Petey’s Network Cultures class. I can’t code meaningful projects in my own time and struggle in my computer science classes, while comparative media classes are fun and exciting but I often lack the writing abilities to make anything particularly extraordinary in my classes. I’ve been learning  to be okay with my mediocrity There is an upshot to this, though. I find that with the little time left here at MIT, I’m trying to spend my time here more  . I am joining clubs that I really believe in and appreciate, like  LSC I don’t know what the future holds. But knowing that there are two semesters left freaks me the fuck out, and so I’m determined to make the most of it.  I want to join a musical or a dance group! I want to take a writing class and more media studies classes! I want to go to a media studies conference! I want to go to all the cool parties and befriend cool people and pull all nighters talking to interesting people because I don’t know the next time I’ll be able to do these things. My time is ticking away and I need to make the most of it because there is no next time, there is no redoing the MIT undergraduate experience, and God, I really hope I don’t waste it.

The media portrays spring break in college is super-fun, adventure-filled time, a time to relax, hang out with your friends, and have the experiences of a lifetime. Last year, MIT didn’t give us a spring break because of the covid restrictions at the time (not that I would’ve wanted to travel very far then); so this year, I knew I wanted to make the most of my ✨first college spring break✨. Like many MIT students, I decided to travel with my friends. Unlike many MIT students, we chose not to go to Puerto Rico, Mexico, or
 
Miami. ⁠ 01 although all of these options were considered, then discarded for one reason or another We flew to New Orleans on Saturday evening. Because the week before spring break was literally hell with psets and exams and projects, I had gotten an extension for a paper for my
 
anthropology class ⁠ 02 21A.407: Gender, Race, and Environmental Justice 
done! ⁠ 03 and I got a good grade on it too, so nothing lost here Previous Next In New Orleans, we stayed at this really cool place called the India House Hostel, a hippie backpacker’s haven. We got a private room for four people, which was essentially the best of both worlds because we got the price of a hostel but the privacy of a separate room. I don’t have too many pictures of the house, but it was really eclectically decorated and had a good vibe all around. Previous Next We spent most of our time in New Orleans just walking around the city, soaking in the beautiful streets, live music, and good weather. I bought a math textbook and a book of french poetry at a used bookstore. Amber bought a vinyl record of some obscure rock band. We saw a drag show. We ate lots of delicious cajun cuisine, which Sophia, foodie that she is, was responsible for directing us to. We relaxed, and we didn’t think about school or work or anything, really. Previous Next Previous Next On our last full day in New Orleans, a severe storm came into the area. We were out in the city when the wind started really picking up, the sky became overcast, and the shops started closing up. It was honestly a little spooky to see the city empty out in the middle of the day, and we decided to take it as a sign to go back to the hostel and wait the storm out. It’s a good thing we did, too, since the rain came down   soon after we had gotten back to our room. What’s more, that evening two tornadoes struck New Orleans, thankfully far from where we were, but still… scary stuff. So, we spent the evening at the hostel, just kind of hanging out and relaxing. The storm had left us with one with one thing on our to-do list, which was to get our fortunes read (NOLA is famous for its fortune-tellers), so we decided that the next morning we’d get up extra early to check that off of our list before getting a car and driving to Texas. Of course, nothing is that simple. The following morning it turned out that all the fortune-tellers in the French Quarter of the city are much too expensive, and we’re college students, after all, so we settled for buying a deck of tarot cards and eating some beignets for breakfast. We then packed up all of our stuff, checked out, and headed to the airport, where we had a reservation to rent a car. Texas awaits, we’re supposed to go see some alligators in a swamp on the way there. Except, again, nothing is that simple! At the airport, we’re told that in order to rent a car, you have to be a) 20 years of age, b) have a driver’s license, and c) pay with your own credit card. In our group of four, everyone met two of the criteria, but no one met
 
all three…. ⁠ 04 I'm from NYC, of course I can't drive... Previous Next And so I ended up back home, in NYC. Although I had not originally intended to go home over break, I’m actually quite glad that things worked out in this way. I’ve said it before, but MIT is fundamentally exhausting. Good and bad exhaustion weave together to form the never-ending firehose, and there’s really no escaping it
 
unless you physically leave campus. ⁠ 05 at least for me, maybe other people have better coping mechanisms and work/life balance the view from my friend’s rooftop deck in brooklyn is insane

Over spring break, I crashed at my recently graduated friend’s place in NYC.  In an attempt to get back part of my soul after what’s honestly been a soulsucking semester so far, I went full-on retail therapy at several bookstores. I bought several comic books, because unlike the average blogger, I suck at reading text novels for fun. The past two weeks have been … a lot. As a cherry on top, I tested positive for covid this week and am currently languishing in isolation. While I suddenly have so much free time, I don’t feel like doing anything other than admire the art in my new comic books.  by  Tillie Walden There are a lot of nebulous feelings I’m trying to define and process right now, but I don’t feel like airing that on the Internet. So I’ll just say that I wish I could skip to the end of this particularly difficult semester and the beginning of summer, which I look forward to with cautious optimism. #giant flying cat

When I’m sad, or there’s some conundrum in my life that I need to process, or I’m riding the high from hanging out with friends, or I’m so stressed that I can barely quiet the buzz of all the bees in my head–I go grocery shopping. Over IAP, with mostly nothing else to do because I ended up dropping my UROP–a story for another time–I started cooking. A lot. This is a fairly common thing that students do during IAP, because it’s like, “Nice! I have all this free time. I might as well start feeding myself actual food.” I’d say that during the semesters, I do an okay job at making actual food. It usually ends up being a lot more
 
Chipotle ⁠ 01 because it's like, really close to east campus. temptingly close 
YamiBuy. ⁠ 02 an app that delivers asian snacks. a very good app even though shipping and delivery takes a while I watch a lot of ASMR cooking videos on YouTube. They’re actually a pretty big genre on YouTube, mostly consisting of people with aesthetic cookware aesthetically chopping vegetables and arranging them in aesthetic bowls and aesthetic plates, aesthetically, all paired with aesthetic background music. When I watch them, I like to daydream about having my own  cozy little kitchen I like this channel in particular,  delicious day And because I am very fond of adapting elaborate Notion templates to specific purposes, I found this  kitchen-managing system So…fancy Notion template + ASMR cooking videos = Mel discovers how to become a kitchen god. snippet of how i use my kitchen template… Here’s a link to my  adapted template Previous Next When spring semester started, I tried to keep cooking, but as entropy in the form of psets and classes would have it, my mealplanning slowly fell apart. I went back to Chipotle as a default meal when I was too busy or tired for other things. But even though I’m going to the grocery store less these days, it brings me the same amount of joy. Something about it feels rhythmic and comforting. Taking the T to HMart with my little grocery tote in hand. Walking across the bridge to Trader Joe’s to buy yogurt and soup and baby’s breath. Running to Brothers Marketplace in the evening to stock up on milk and eggs. i love tj flowers It’s like a reset. It gives me time to play music and ignore the rest of the world for a little bit and, as I peruse the aisles of soup cans and baking supplies and pass by piles of tomatoes and onions, it lets me pretend like I’m someone who has their life together. Someone who knows what they’re looking for and what they’re going to do instead of someone who’s lost and drifting at sea, trying to find a way back to shore. Fake it till you make it, right? Earlier this year, I found this poem:   by Sabrina Benaim. Here’s a  video The sadness comes in waves. I think I’m no longer as sad and lonely as I was when I first read this, but it still rings true. everybody loves me because i’m good at making people feel good. i’m good at making people feel good because i have had a lot of practice on myself. practice on myself because i feel sad a lot. i feel sad a lot, but when i make people feel good, i feel good for a little bit. i feel good for a little bit, until i get lonely. i get lonely and i am uncomfortable in my lonely. And maybe it’s true that making people feel good doesn’t solve the problem, but it does make me feel better for a little bit. As I mentioned in an  earlier blog Most of all, I think I am trying to be more comfortable in my loneliness every time it decides to visit me again.

Breathe in. Keep breathing. The prefrosh I was hosting, or  , as so many hosts refer to theirs, arrived on Thursday morning. We talked about logistics; this is how you get to East Campus, this is the couch you’ll sleep in, I’m gonna head to class now. The first class I had that morning was 6.UAT, Oral Communication. We play some improv games, which we do in 6.UAT to learn about things like recovery. What do you do when things don’t go as planned? You slip up, you forget a sentence, the projector doesn’t work, the power goes out. The key idea is that no matter what happens,  . You have to  maintain composure Class ends early, so we stick around for a few minutes. We talk about CPW, and when our prefrosh are arriving. People are excited. My second and last class that day was 6.033 Computer Systems Engineering. We talk about databases, and how they work in the event of a crash. Most databases use a steal/no-force design, which performs the fastest, but has the most work to do during recovery. The database design trade-off always seems to be like this: the faster you drive, the harder you crash. Back in East Campus, people are grilling burgers and dyeing hair. The grills are hot! as the saying goes. EC denizens step out of their slumber and into the courtyard. I put a patty on the grills, then toast buns, then cheese. It’s good. I missed this. I head to Talbot, the lounge next to EC’s front desk, and set up the projector. I was going to run a  Python spelling bee bad ideas weekend events The Python bee happens, and it is as silly as ever. Contestants write programs that accidentally work, that almost work, that barely work, and that don’t work. Indents are forgotten,   and   are confused, and a plethora of other mistakes are made. The event goes well, though lasts a little long; I should figure out how to make it shorter next year. Upstairs I try to take a nap, but am distracted by my prefrosh. We play a game of  Funny Game: Penguin Jrap Activate He then told me that he forgot to bring a phone charger, so I told him he could probably borrow one from someone on hall. I find that one of the coolest things on East Campus; that my neighbors are so kind. He leaves. I put on  rain clothes I see a friend in the crowd. I tell him that I’m trying to vicariously experience CPW this weekend. Speeches are given. The  Logs ADT It ends. I run to the sixth floor of Building 24, where  ESG is MIT ESP That was just Thursday. That was my   busy day of CPW. Friday. Grilled burgers for lunch. More classes. A board game event. The ESP office, hanging out with people. An event  in ET Meet the Bloggers SIPB office Conversations. “Have you ever thought about how you’re going to die?” Or, “How much sleep do people get?” Or, “Why MIT?” Indeed,  I sleep at five in the morning, exhausted from a day of CPW. Saturday. Grilled burgers for lunch. The  Activities Midway There was a  Puzzle Club I wake up and head to Building 34 to clean up after an  Assassins Guild event  I ask.  he replies. Words didn’t need to be spoken. I run to my next event in McCormick for the  Filipino Students Association On Sunday morning my prefrosh and I woke up at around the same time. He leaves. I see him off. Are you still breathing? Good. It wouldn’t do to have you running out of breath, not this early, not yet. On Sunday afternoon I mill about the EC courtyard. I see people walking around aimlessly, almost dazed. In Talbot, the scene is similar. People sitting down in couches, staring into space. I could understand. I could understand so, so well. And as much as I wanted to stare into space and reflect on the weekend, as much as I wanted to write this blog post, and put some more effort into it so it doesn’t end up feeling like a ball of mud, as much as I want to go to sleep and take a break, I needed to keep moving. Because I had a meeting that afternoon, and I had office hours that evening. I had homework due the next day, the next day, the next day. I had midterms this week. I had group projects to work on. No time to stop for breaths; sleep my only respite as I bounce from activity to activity. Why? Why do I want to do less things? Of course. Of course. Of course. Have you taken your breath yet? Because I’m still holding mine. I closed my eyes on Thursday morning and now it is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I find myself marching, once again, to the relentless beat of weekdays. What does it say about MIT, for CPW to be such a large, grand event in the midst of a busy time in the semester? What does it say to the prefrosh, several of whom are deciding between MIT and elsewhere, to see MIT shine and sparkle so much during CPW, but not stick around to see the fallout? I wish I knew. I wish I could write something better. I wish I had more to show for a weekend I poured my heart and soul into. But all I have is a mouthful of dust that I am trying to breathe, breathe out.

spoilers for the book  siddhartha i . at the beginning of my first 21w.755 (reading and writing short stories)  lecture last semester, the professor asked the class if we knew what the hegelian dialectic was. he got back a wide variety of responses: one student said it documented the relationship between masters and slaves; someone else said it was about the id, ego, and superego; another person said it modeled election cycles and political movements; and so on it turns out the answer he was looking for was much simpler – he just wanted to talk about the relationship between thesis, antithesis, and synthesis in writing. specifically, a  thesis  is introduced at the beginning of a text (oftentimes in the form of a character or setting), it encounters an  antithesis  (eg. an opposing character or some kind of conflict, external or internal), and through this interaction a  synthesis  is produced that incorporates elements of both the thesis and antithesis (eg. a character grows or their world changes). my professor received so many different answers when he asked his question because people have applied this framework in a broad range of settings; it is such a general model of change that some might even consider it vacuous ii . my high school world history class was a two-year course that attempted to cover art history and regular history simultaneously. one of the many things we talked about was how early america adopted neoclassicism, an art style which in many aspects attempted to imitate the classical style from ancient greece and rome. for instance, many well-known buildings in washington dc, like the capitol and supreme court, feature roman domes and greek columns i remember learning about this and being confused – i thought at the time that art was supposed to consistently progress towards greater expressivity and completeness. so if we were copying a style from over a thousand years ago, what was the point of all the art produced in between? was it all worse or less valid than what came before it?  iii . one behavior i notice a lot is people changing their mind on something and then being reluctant to change their mind a second time. for example, people at mit sometimes decide to switch from pursuing academia to pursuing industry, and then afterwards they realize they made a mistake but feel that it is unacceptable to switch back. i’ve seen some other people go through the exact same process except with the roles of academia and industry reversed, or with two different majors or fields of industry or grad schools, or with startups and non-startups. or, for an example not related to career decisions, people often exit a club or social circle, miss it, and then feel like they’re not allowed to rejoin even when their peers would be happy to have them back in my experience the phenomenon of feeling like you can’t change your mind again usually comes from wanting to avoid embarrassment or from wanting to avoid feeling stupid.   as in: i worried that if i changed my mind a second time, people would ridicule me for being dumb the first time around. this was especially true in my early days of blogging, when i wrote about every time i had a major update and felt like i wasn’t able to retract previous updates that i no longer agreed with.   as in: changing my mind twice felt like i was going in circles and not making progress, like i was just wasting my time and would’ve been better off simply staying put, and i did not like that realization. it took a long process of me conquering parts of my ego and becoming more detached to reach the state i am at now, where i feel comfortable with admitting both to other people and to myself when i am wrong about practically any subject here is one interpretation of all this through the dialectic: changing your mind twice does not indicate  regression , it indicates  synthesis . it means you started with a thesis and explored an antithesis; the resulting synthesis is a reaffirmation of the thesis, but it is not the same as the thesis because you now understand the role of the antithesis and are able to reject it. it is like how neoclassicism is not the same as classicism because choosing to revisit classicism when you have access to over a millennium of new developments is different from choosing classicism because it is the most recent of styles; this choice does not make everything from that intermediate millennium less valid, it just means that those things aren’t what you need right now and as a result you are never really regressing even when you retract your previous opinions or choices or efforts. you are never truly moving in circles because every time you complete a loop of the circle you are also moving forward. it is okay to change your mind. it is okay to change your mind twice. it is okay to do this as many times as you need to, as long as you are doing so with good reason. there is nothing stupid or shameful about this, and even if people do mock you for it they’ll forget and stop soon enough anyway iv . i keep revisiting the topic of social media addiction because it is something i and many of my friends have struggled with, and i think people who’ve read my writing for a while are getting annoyed because i say the same thing each time, but every time i feel like i can express what i want to communicate better than i could the previous time so i keep taking new stabs at it the main idea i keep repeating is very simple: that getting off social media on your own, reducing social media time through app or website blockers, and spending minimal time on social media because you’ve never used it are extremely different states of being, even if they result in the same short-term outcome. they represent different degrees of awareness about why spending too much time on social media is unsatisfying and how to best address that dissatisfaction. or, to put it differently, they represent different levels of incorporation of the antithesis in  siddhartha , the protagonist siddhartha is raised in a studious household where he meditates intensely, but he quickly realizes spirituality is meaningless and descends into a life of hedonism, encountering and rejecting the buddha along the way. a few decades later he decides being rich and having sex with attractive women isn’t fulfilling, and he tries to raise his son “the right way” so that he learns to be patient and wise and virtuous during my favorite chapter of the book, the son gets bored of trying to live “the right way” and runs away from home. siddhartha tries to bring him back, worrying to his friend  “But look, how shall I put him, who had no tender heart anyhow, into this world? Won’t he become exuberant, won’t he lose himself to pleasure and power, won’t he repeat all of his father’s mistakes, won’t he perhaps get entirely lost?” to which siddhartha’s friend replies  “Would you actually believe that you had committed your foolish acts in order to spare your son from committing them too? … How could you? By means of teachings, prayer, admonition? My dear, have you entirely forgotten … that story about Siddhartha, which you once told me here on this very spot? Who has kept Siddhartha safe from sin, from greed, from foolishness? Were his father’s religious devotion, his teachers’ warnings, his own knowledge, his own search able to keep him safe? Which father, which teacher had been able to protect him from living his life for himself, from soiling himself with life, from burdening himself with guilt, from drinking the bitter drink for himself, from finding his path for himself? Would you think, my dear, anybody might perhaps be spared from taking this path? That perhaps your little son would be spared, because you love him, because you would like to keep him from suffering and pain and disappointment? But even if you would die ten times for him, you would not be able to take the slightest part of his destiny upon yourself!” siddhartha hears this, decides he can’t teach his son to be a good person by forcing it upon him, and lets him go in peace. he understands that the only real way to learn what you should do is to try things you shouldn’t do and then realize that you made a mistake – to revisit the social media example, someone who has spent their entire life abstaining from social media has no idea how they’ll behave when circumstance forces them to use it, whereas someone who has successfully wrestled with social media themselves knows exactly how to get off every time they need to v . when i look back on the subjects i took a spontaneous interest in during college, it’s a bit laughable how many areas i explored and how irrelevant many of them are to what i currently do. in chronological order, i spent at least a month primarily working on: applied math for biology, theoretical cs research, big tech, healthcare, biotech, web development, finance, computer systems, crypto, and mental health software i know a lot of college students, especially at mit, who have carefully planned out their classes, the jobs and research they’ll take on, the social groups and clubs they’ll participate in, etc. with very little tolerance for deviation from the plan. it is possible to organize the next few years of your life in this manner and have everything go accordingly, so that at the end of it all you more or less become the person you expected to be i don’t have a problem with the plans themselves. i think plans are important for bringing focus and direction to your life, especially in the short term. the problem is when commitment to long-term plans blinds your view of the world, when a refusal to change your mind prevents you from experiencing the antitheses that you need to experience in order to reach the syntheses that you could have reached for a different view on how limited these kinds of long-term plans are: a year ago i didn’t know how computers worked under the hood, two years ago i didn’t understand what neural networks were or how to use them, and three years ago i didn’t know anything about the internet or web development. all three of these are now fairly central components in my knowledge of computer science despite me not having learned about them until relatively recently, and i’m pretty sure most cs students at mit had similar if not steeper learning curves so what does it mean when a generic high schooler walks into mit and says they want to major in computer science or any other major? do they really have any idea what it’s actually like to study the thing they say they want to study? a small minority of them probably do, but i’d bet the vast majority are like me and have no clue what working on computer science, or any other subject, truly entails. and this lack of understanding means that committing to a very specific long-term college plan is in my opinion a bit absurd it is okay to make mistakes like getting hooked on tiktok or picking the wrong major or getting lost in materialism. it is okay to change your mind and your plans and anything else that needs to be changed. every choice is okay as long as you are seeking out antitheses and paying enough attention to understand the syntheses that emerge one of my friends says that all of their beliefs are  “strong opinions, weakly held” , eg. putting earnest effort into pursuing a goal but being open to changing the goal.  “strong opinions”  because you need to hold positions distinctive enough to notice when those positions are wrong – for example, if you’re worried about the covid vaccine and tell your vaxxed friends  “i’m scared that covid vaccines might be extremely dangerous”  they’re likely to point you to science on why it’s relatively safe, whereas if you say  “i’m scared that the covid vaccine might have side effects which are potentially harmful”  they will probably just nod along and you won’t learn anything.  “weakly held”  because, once you realize an opinion is wrong, you need to be able to change it. this system is sometimes used by obnoxious people to justify making rude statements, but it’s also led to my friend being one of the most consistently correct people i’ve ever met, so make of that whatever you will

It was so exciting to be able to welcome the 1000+ adMITed students to campus these past two weekends. Many of you have explored our campus before, but for some of you, this was your first time. I also know that many of you got the chance to explore the Cambridge area. So, I figured this is the best time to tell you about some of  the things I first learned when I moved and explored Boston. Maybe you’ve experienced some of these already  or maybe I just gave you another reason to come back 👀.  As you can see from my bio, I am not from Massachusetts. In fact, this is the furthest north I have ever lived. Here is a list of almost ten random things that I have learned since moving to Beantown.  Beantown at Jordan’s Furniture.  I recently found out about this place from a couple of coworkers, but “Beantown” is a replica of downtown Boston entirely out of Jelly beans! This furniture store also holds an IMAX theater. I have not yet been, but when I do it just might deserve its own blog. Sports are serious.  Though I have opinions on specific athletes/sports that I just do not like ( hint:  deflategate) it is just much safer to lie. My advice is to say you don’t watch sports or say your favorite team is any one of the 5 professional teams from Boston.  The “T” is your friend.  The “T” is the shorthand for the MBTA subway system in Boston. Since the city is so congested, living close to a train station will be one of the best decisions you can make when you move. Luckily for me, the Admissions Office is right off of the Kendall/MIT stop on the redline. Everyone bikes.  As someone who lived in Washington, D.C. for a few years, trust me when I say that I’ve been to a place where so many people bike. I have seen people of all ages and sizes riding around on bikes here. Traffic is 24/7.  I thought that there would be traffic downtime. Nope, there are always cars on the road, if you live in the city, so plan accordingly.  Seasons are not real.   In most places, you will have four distinct seasons. Boston has two. It will either be hot or it will be cold. The cold months will last at least from October through March. If you always have a jacket and an umbrella, you’ll be fine (Beware: It has snowed in April in recent years). Boston runs on Dunkin.   I feel like there is at least one Dunkin Donuts every block or so. Dunkin is not just a fast food chain, it is a way of life for Bostonians (They take their Dunks  very  seriously). The first thing I ordered was a Boston creme donut. Surprisingly, it tastes better in Boston! The typical Boston accent is a myth.  Maybe it does exist. I was just disappointed that I don’t hear it often. When I first got here, I really wanted to hear someone yell “mah” or “cah”. Moving to Boston has been one of my latest adventures, and as I prepare to move again, I look forward to seeing what this new area holds. I feel like there is never enough exploring of Boston to be done, so be on the lookout for another exploration blog.

until a few weeks ago, i’d never had a college spring break (spreak, as some may say). in my freshman year, i was kicked off campus a few weeks before spreak due to the pandemic, and i’ve had no opportunities for week-long vacations with my friends ever since. but, from March 18 to March 27th, i got to experience spreak in all its glory! it was absolutely incredible. this year, there were a few locations in consideration for my group of
 
friends: ⁠ 01 all junior, sophomore, and freshmen bombers (members of burton third) Puerto Rico seemed like our best bet; it’s a great location, not super far, and flights weren’t very expensive. as a plus, hundreds of other MIT students were planning on going there. however, a lot of people in my group started talking about San Diego as an option since we would be staying in someone’s house there for free. enough people defected to San Diego that I joined them—I decided that going to California with a ton of people would be better than going to a better location with just a few people. we bought tickets a month before spring break started, and that was that in terms of planning. spring break officially began on the 18th, but it emotionally started for me on Wednesday the 16th, which was the night of a Tame Impala concert in TD Garden. a lot of MIT people went, and it was one of the best concert experiences of my life, second only to the Tame Impala set i saw during a  music festival with the homies @ TD garden the next day, I went to a
 
Burton 1/Burton 3rd/Burton 4/Zeta Psi ⁠ 02 burton conner communities, as you might imagine. burton 3rd is where i lived before the dorm was closed down, and it continues to be my primary living group despite not...living with everyone in it on Friday, I woke up and immediately ubered to the airport with two people in my group who also live in East Campus. we traveled from 11 am to 8 pm, which sucked, but hitting the beach right after we arrived was fantastic. a beach in coronado we were staying at a house on Coronado Island, so we had to either ferry or Uber across the (very beautiful) bridge to get to the mainland. obviously, we weren’t about to ferry to the club, which meant we spent a shit ton of money on Ubers. oops! the bridge view made it super worth it, though. there were 13 people in our group, and with three bedrooms, two air mattresses, and   couches, we made the sleeping arrangements work. hanging out with so many of my close friends in close quarters reminded me of the floor trip we take to Maine each November, except that California is far prettier and warmer… actual coronado beach we mostly spent our time going to the beach, visiting nice cafes and restaurants for brunch or dinner, and exploring Coronado and the city. we ambled through Little Italy and Gaslamp, checked out the nightlife in Hillcrest (on multiple occasions), and took day trips to places like La Jolla and Ocean Beach. La Jolla was super dope, especially the tide pools and the ocean-view hiking trails. it’s such an idyllic place!! hiking in la jolla another day, we visited Balboa Park, which is one of the most interesting places I’ve been in recent memory. the architecture is beautiful and the museums are so cool!! it also has a Japanese friendship garden that’s absolutely stunning. oh mein gott we also went to Belmont Park, a cute little amusement park. it was strange to finally be able to visit an amusement park with my friends when Six Flags isn’t too far from us. given, the Class of 2023 is going to Six Flags later this month, but it took a class council coordinating an entire trip for us to make it happen. the last couple of days, we hung out on a friend of a friend’s yacht and went sailing. I almost lost my bucket hat in the ocean, but thanks to my friend’s incredible sailing skills, we were able to rescue it. I haven’t taken sailing as a PE class while at MIT because I never took the
 
boat test, ⁠ 03 you have to tread water for 10 minutes after swimming 4 laps and i was simply too lazy balboa park cactus garden as you might expect, the week went by in a flash, and we were flying back to Boston to be greeted by 19 degree weather! it was humiliating to be subjected to rainy, cloudy Cambridge after a blissful week in Cali. ah, well. all in all, my break was phenomenal. now that the semester is getting intense, I can’t help looking back and wishing I was still in San Diego. I may have lost two spring break opportunities, but I have one more of them, and I fully intend to make the most of it :’)

You may have noticed that everything in this institvte is named by either an acronym or a number. There’s a quirky language to MIT, a handful of words we made up and toss at each other — here are a few you may hear around campus here at CPW! contents: 1.   literally, ‘junk.’ More specifically, cool  junk that MIT students snatch and hoard away, typically lab equipment and electronics found on reuse or at Stata loading docks. 2.   the act of finding cruft and hoarding it 3.   MIT alums : 1.   old MIT saying about what MIT students do on the day-to-day. Hack = hacking, of course; punt = punting work, playing; tool = working.  2.   eponymous musical about MIT culture :  umanities,  rts, and  ocial  ciences; used to refer to any non-technical class.   the state of being exhausted, overworked, drained, etc. etc.  See also: firehose. :   “An MIT education is like drinking from a firehose,” or so the saying goes. The firehose is the constant barrage of work everyone gleefully puts upon themselves.  An acronym for MIT life. Either “I hate this fucking place” or “I have truly found paradise,” as the mood suits you. :   at MIT “getting an internship” refers specifically to getting an internship at a company external to MIT. Research positions within MIT are referred to as UROPs. :   problem set; one per class, 5-8 problems, due weekly, takes forever. They say that you cannot start them the day they are due, although empirical testing shows this is not entirely true. Also written ‘p-set.’ 1.  ndergraduate  esearch  pportunity  rogram, as in doing research.  2.   an undergrad in a lab doing research.  3.   the work assigned by your urop (see definition 1).  4.   working in a urop.  Every academic department has its own number, and we refer to majors and minors by their numbers. This honestly obfuscates information until you sit down and memorize the list. The departments are numbered up to 24, but here are the most common majors: : computer science. Here, 6 is the major, and 3 is the track   the major — it doesn’t refer to course 3, which is materials science. 6-1 is electrical engineering, 6-2 is EECS (electrical engineering and computer science), and 6-3 is straight CS. 6-3 is the most common major at MIT. : applied math (flex option). : computer science and neuroscience. 9 is the neuroscience department, so in this case 6 and 9 both refer to departments. biology.  physics. : MechE (flex option). The full name is 2A-X, X being your concentration. It can be department you can argue is related to your major; common choices are 2A-6 (comp sci), 2A-4 (design), and 2A-3 (materials science). Most MechEs are 2A; those in course 2 who don’t take the flex path are ‘straight 2,’ cue jokes. We also refer to people as their majors. For example, “What course are you?” could be answered “6-3,” “I’m a 6-3,” or, rarely, “CS.” Here is a full list of departments, linked to their respective course catalogs: Course 1 – Civil and Environmental Engineering Course 2 – Mechanical Engineering Course 3 – Materials Science and Engineering Course 4 – Architecture Course 5 – Chemistry Course 6 – Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Course 7 – Biology Course 8 – Physics Course 9 – Brain and Cognitive Sciences Course 10 – Chemical Engineering Course 11 – Urban Studies and Planning Course 12 – Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences Course 14 – Economics Course 15 – Management Course 16 – Aeronautics and Astronautics Course 17 – Political Science Course 18 – Mathematics Course 20 – Biological Engineering Course 21 – Humanities Anthropology (21A) Comparative Media Studies (CMS) Writing (21W) Global Languages (21G) History (21H) Literature (21L) Music and Theater Arts (21M) Women’s and Gender Studies (WGS) Course 22 – Nuclear Science and Engineering Course 24 – Linguistics and Philosophy If you’ve clicked on any of those links, you may have noticed that each class has a specific number. We typically refer to technical classes by their numbers, rather than by their names. For example, ‘Fundamentals of Programming’ is numbered 6.009 [“six double-oh nine”], and I cannot say for certain if I have ever heard it referred to in words. People say “.009” or sometimes “boog”. The first number is the department; the numbers after the decimal bear some reference to the level of difficulty or order you should take the classes in. That pattern varies wildly by department, however, so I will not attempt to decode it. When referring to a Course 6 class, sometimes people drop the 6; it’s just assumed. Generally people don’t do that with other departments, unless you’re talking to someone in your major. Here are a few common classes you may hear about: : Fundamentals of Programming : [“six double oh six,” “double oh six,” occasionally “boob”] Introduction to Algorithms : [“six oh three six”] Introduction to Machine Learning [“eighteen oh one”] calculus multivariable calculus differential equations Physics I, classical mechanics : Physics II, electricity and magnetism [“five eleven one”] intro chemistry [“six triple-oh-one”] intro to programming : [“three oh nine one”] intro to materials science different intro biology classes I likely didn’t catch all the jargon here, so check out this older and more thorough blogpost if you’d like to see more! Speaking in MITese Then go out and enjoy CPW :D

I know how excited I was for my CPW, so I can only imagine how excited the Class of ’26 is when their last two years of high school were impacted so much by the pandemic. I hosted a mini virtual CPW event on Sunday that people shockingly showed up to, despite me putting in almost 0 planning, and I asked them why they would willingly indulge in another virtual event when they have in-person ones to look forward to this week. most people answered saying they simply   for CPW. valid! I’m a member of one of the two classes that experienced an in-person CPW prior to the pandemic. normally, by this point, I would’ve hosted CPWs in my freshman and sophomore years, but instead I was running weird virtual events as part of CP*! one time, not a single prefrosh showed up :D slay so here I am, a junior CPW chair, writing a CPW how-to with only the hazy memories of my CPW to guide me. this is   credible and you should take everything I say to heart!! being psycho about scheduling every hour of your day only gets you so far. look at this spreadsheet that I made back in 2019 in ADDITION to my very over-populated Google Calendar. did it give me an idea of where I wanted to go and what parts of campus I wanted to explore? yes. did I go to even a third of these events? ain’t no way the greek life events on here are hilarious because i am so not about greek life now lol my year, I made a ton of friends in the Messenger groupchats that I spent a lot of time talking to pre-CPW. we all made spreadsheets like this so we could compare, which wasn’t the best move since it’s best to go to the events you want to go to rather than planning around other people’s interests. anyways, you have a dope website to help you plan your CPW, so there’s no need for insane spreadsheets like this. peruse all the events, add the ones you’re interested in, and go to the ones you’re feeling at the time. that’s about it! there is SO much to do on campus—in addition to all the dorm/residential life events, there’s academics, UROPs, and clubs. it’s overwhelming, so don’t try to optimize, just do what you can. running back and forth across campus to get 15 minutes at each event is not a fun time. my CPW, I stuck with one friend group. it was great, but I wish I’d been more flexible; I could’ve met a lot more people. the thing about coming to campus no one is that it forces you to leave your comfort zone and hang out with new people who have similar interests—after all, they came to the same event as you. if you’re coordinating with an already-established friend group, you’re going to have tons of fun, but you’ll be limited in the experiences you can have. don’t be afraid to wander off and do your own thing! there are so many dope people to meet, and you won’t find them if you’re chilling with the same four people all the time. I’m pretty sure I stayed up until 6 am every single day of CPW in various Burton Conner lounges. it was great, but damn…I felt like I was post seven-week bender when Sunday rolled around. take care of yourself! as a student, it’s important to find balance, and CPW is no exception. drink water and get lots of sleep so it cancels out the copious amounts of free food you’ll be eating :) CPW should be stress-free since you have quite a bit of time until you commit to MIT and arrive on campus, but it’s nice to start exploring communities early. everyone has to live in a dorm your first year on campus, so wouldn’t it be great to find one you vibe with?? MIT students get support from all sorts of places, but for many people, their residential communities are the most crucial. it’s good to use CPW to get a glimpse of what living groups MIT has to offer. if you’re interested, look at the dorm pages and check out their resources (such as i3 videos) to get a sense of their vibe. there are a lot of factors that go into choosing the dorm right for you, but you don’t have to worry about most of them right now; you won’t be choosing between cooking and dining halls and such at CPW. just seek out people and events that you vibe with! don’t worry if you end up not going to a wide spectrum of res life events, or if you can’t find events you really enjoy. my living group, Burton Third, has been the most important part of my MIT experience, and I didn’t find this community until REX. I was hosted in Burton Conner for my CPW and knew I liked the people, so I went to events in a handful of dorms at my CPW, and ended up ranking Burton Conner #1 later. upperclassmen are super hype to meet you. half of the school never had a real CPW, so they’re thrilled to experience it for themselves, and the other half knows exactly how you’re feeling! don’t be afraid to ask us anything—upperclassmen aren’t scary and they know what’s up. your host is there to support you in your experience, so they are a super valuable resource. ask them any questions and share your concerns! get their contact info so you can coordinate wake-up/sleeping times and such with them, and ask them about their living group and activities on campus. you can approach event hosts too; they’re all students who are excited to help you and point you in whatever direction you need. I’m not going to put a cliche “tip #6: have FUN!!!” because god that is cringe and chances are you’ll be having a fun time anyways…so yeah, that’s about it!  come say hi to all of us and ridicule me for all the trash I publish blithely to the internet  my friend Karyn ‘23.5 is a god of interactive installations and will be projecting onto the dorm Simmons every night for three hours. come see! you can stay for as long as you want  since we have no Burton Conner grills to use :(( come eat some strange, strange meats and meet B3rd  pull up for an absurd time involving skateboards and WAY too much duct tape eat hot wings as you try to answer strange questions. featuring a lot of wings and a lot more hot sauces  this event changed my life and might change yours too! i’m hosting it. come for the most befuddling bamboozling experience you’ll ever have  could not tell you what this event is. let’s find out together  B3rd and C2 will be there to eat ice cream with you and chat about BC/MIT/anything. C2 is a lit community so come through  I’m CPW Chair and helped coordinate all our events, so I’d highly recommend any of them. BC has been such a formative part of my MIT experience and it’s FINALLY reopening, so come get to know us and the dorm!  at my CPW, my rope swing released right when the chorus of Electric Love came on and it was kind of incredible and that’s all! happy CPW :) see you soon <3

I’ve been gone from the blogs for a little while, since this semester has been quite a difficult one and I haven’t really had the headspace to write. I’m hoping to come back soon, but, in the meantime, please accept this meager offering. I’d like to write a happy post. 
Some light fare, on making paradise 
for  CPW spring break adventures 
or the way that life dances 
around this place, 
like the light glinting off the river. I’d paint you  a walk along the river 
in this nimbly crafted post; 
I’d tell you  how I love this place 
about  its gentle paradise 
all in prose that takes your hand and dances. 
You’d get to  come along on my adventures The adventures 
along the river 
or at dances— 
they’re real.  I could write that post 
Sometimes, it’s a paradise; 
miracles are commonplace. Sometimes, though, it’s just a place. Not all adventures 
are good. No place is a paradise. 
The river 
simply flows, like time. This post 
is just some text, which hardly dances. Recently, I’ve had dearth of dances: 
This semester’s place 
permits  no space to breathe 
And yes, there has been  time for some adventures 
but on the darkest days, I miss the river. 
How could I call this paradise? Then again, there is no paradise 
except the one we find ourselves in dances, 
the joy we find in  fiery sunsets 
the  beauty in this sometimes horrid place 
We help ourselves to  all these grand adventures 
(and some of us, we take those times and post!) IHTFP and IHTFP. 
In between the dances and adventures, 
I smile at the river; I write a happy post. ##Poetry

Hello world! I’m Song, I’m currently a freshman here at MIT, and I lived in Jenny’s current room during orientation week before the Next House Housing Lottery switched up everyone’s rooms. In the class
 
6.009 ⁠ 01 Fundamentals of Programming, but the CS department is renumbering classes relatively soon so this might become obsolete in a few months  you have to write an
 
interpreter ⁠ 02 thing that compiles and runs code from a particular programming language  for a programming language called snek, which is a dialect of  LISP . But what if,
 
what if we used one of these languages instead? ⁠ 03 Adam Hartz (6.009 instructor), this is for you. All of these are esoteric programming languages (esolangs), which are impractical and usually silly. LOLCODE is presumably what would happen if you let one of these guys make a programming language: LOLCODE syntax is more or less comprehensible, assuming you know lolspeak. This is more than can be said about a good number of esolangs. I’m sort of working on a LOLCODE-to-Python interpreter (when I’m motivated to do so/not hosed) , and the fact that LOLCODE relies on English-esque words as commands makes writing this interpreter
 
more difficult ⁠ 04 see: OREREREREREREREREREO  Syntax is also flexible, which makes this worse;   and   mean the same thing. Fibonacci (with more fun syntax!) this is the logo of the software a bunch of classes here use – catsoop :3 
Brainf*** ⁠ 05 rhymes with firetruck – jenny  adds 1 to the memory at the current position  subtracts 1 from the memory at the current position  moves the pointer 1 to the right  moves the pointer 1 to the left  prints the character with ASCII value equal to the current position’s memory  takes a single character as input and stores its ASCII value at the current position in memory  begins a loop  ends a loop Brainf*** is Turing-complete, meaning that it technically can be used to write any program you want… but writing “concise” code in brainf*** is a challenge. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++. >+++++++++[<++++++++>-]<.>+++++++[<++++>-]<+.+++++++..+++.[-]>++++++++[<++++>-]<.>+++++++++++[<++++++++>-]<-.——–.+++.——.——–.[-]>++++++++[<++++>- ]<+.[-]++++++++++. There’s also  this cool website , which lets you visualize how brainf*** code works. Because of its small character/command set, brainf*** can be used to create even more esolangs. One that I like is imagef***, where programs are images and each brainf*** command is represented by a different color. 
imagef*** ⁠ 06 also rhymes with duck... and yes, the image is 14x14 px OREO uses actual English letters, yet somehow manages to be even more cursed than brainf***. It uses exactly 3 commands:  O  for moving the pointer forward,  RE  for adding 1 to the current memory location, and  &O  for printing the current memory location’s contents (in ASCII). The creator of OREO imagined each line of OREO code as a code sandwich, with RE’s enclosed by O’s. Unlike brainf***, OREO has no support for loops, which makes writing OREO programs very sad and long. In short, OREO is pretty useless. On the flip side, an OREO-to-Python interpreter isn’t too terrible to implement. 
there is no good way to do this: ⁠ 07 “it sounds very JoJo” – jenny Chicken is  even worse  than OREO in that all commands consist of different quantities of the word “chicken”. Nothing else. The idea for this language apparently came from  this joke paper . If you stare at a given piece of Chicken code for too long, the word “chicken”
 
ceases to hold any meaning. ⁠ 08 chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken  Cluck cluck. (Or, depending on age, chirp chirp.) (not part of the code) Python, which is a “legitimate” language, will yell at you if you use both tabs and spaces in the same program. Whitespace takes this idea to the extreme, and the only characters with intrinsic meaning are whitespace characters. Anything that isn’t a whitespace character is ignored, so if nothing else, commenting is relatively simple. I’m not too familiar with Whitespace, but it appears to function in a roughly similar manner to brainf*** and company. I’m not going to reproduce Whitespace code here, but you can go to  https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/  and play inside a “friendly” code-writing environment. Malebolge (with 2 E’s) is the 8th circle of Hell, according to Dante. That about sums it up. Malbolge was designed to be as difficult to program in as possible,
 
using base 3 for its calculations, ⁠ 09 non-Malbolge-running (aka “normal”, non-quantum) computers use base 2  three different registers, 8 different instructions based on some numbers mod 94, and a “crazy” operation. Oh, also, Malbolge code is encrypted. Maybe not 100% accurate, but close enough. Apparently, the creator of Malbolge has never written a program in Malbolge, and the first Malbolge program was found programmatically. Some brave soul somehow managed to make a “Hello World” program: live jenny reaction There are many more esolangs out there , and
 
many more ridiculous things outside of esolangs that can be done on computers. ⁠ 10 e.g. <a href="https://qntm.org/suicide">Suicide Linux</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8">PowerPoint = Turing complete</a>, the entirety of <a href="http://sigtbd.csail.mit.edu/">SIGTBD</a>  Good luck, and  have fun!  :P

Back in January 2021, my boyfriend Raymond realized he was bored during MIT’s
 
IAP ⁠ 01 IAP is Independent Activities Period. Essentially, MIT students get the month of January off to do whatever we please. Here is how that went. : A lot of this information is taken directly from Raymond’s website and you can find  the original post here Raymond took 15.S20 Design for 3D Printing as his first foray into
 
CAD. ⁠ 02 Computer Aided Design When initially designing the model, Raymond knew he wanted a turntable for easily maneuvering the left and right axis. Then, he quickly realized that he needed arms on the side to move the gun up and down. It’s a relatively large gun so he wanted something very stable. He used Lazy Susan turntables as an inspiration since it would be easy to mount on the gun since the gun required a lot of torque due to its size. In order for this to work, Raymond had to get a hold of a fully automated, fully electronic nerf gun. He ended up choosing the  Nerf CS-18 N-Strike Elite Rapidstrike Once he acquired the gun, he began to take it apart. He snipped the wires to the motor and then ran longer wires out of the gun that could connect to the motors. There were two motors inside of it, a pusher motor that pushes the next dart in and the flywheel that shoots the dart out at a rapid speed. Now that he knew the look, make, and feel of the gun, he could start CADing the turret casing. The base consists of two large holes surrounded by mounting holes: one for the
 
stepper motor ⁠ 03 From wikipedia: A <em>stepper motor</em>, also known as <em>step motor</em> or <em>stepping motor</em>, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. On top of this base is a set of gears wihch provides more torque from the stepper motor through a 5:1 gear reduction. This ends up being quite important since the top half is almost 4lbs heavy. Mounted on the gears are the walls which are used to hold the nerf gun up. The left wall has a slot cut out from it to mount
 
the servo ⁠ 04 from wikipedia: A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration Mounted on the walls of the set of lazy susans is the gun mount. The Nerf Gun has a tactical rail system so Raymond printed the railing onto some cylinders. The left mount is slightly extended to interface with the servo on the wall. This is the final product. The turret uses an Arduino Nano hooked up to a stepper motor driver (for the gears), the servo, and two
 
relays ⁠ 05 An electormagnetic that, when on, completes a different circuit. It is an electromechanical switch. Initially, Raymond planned to use a slip ring to pass through the center of the turret so that it could turn 360 degrees continuously. However, there was too much noise in the slip ring to transfer USB 2.0 webcam data through. As a result, he had to remove the slip ring so after a few revolutions, the turret will twist itself up but this is a pretty rare situation. Now that we have the turret casing and everything hooked up, it was time to program the turret! In simple terms, the arduino will receive control signals over serial from a computer vision script from Raymond’s laptop. The arduino code is somewhat simple; it decodes characters over serial and applies the given command to the motors. It is short enough to be displayed here in its entirety: Before Raymond hooked up the webcam to the nerf turret, he wanted to ensure that the movement was smooth and actually worked so he wrote a small Python script to map mouse movements to the turret’s movement. We have a series of videos documenting this process: At this point we were just messing around and testing it. You’ll see from the video below that it fires pretty quickly. After ensuring that she could move and shoot, Raymond finally hooked up the webcam. Raymond used the python API available from  OpenPose Here is the code for the camera loop: Here are some videos of the initial camera tests. At one point Raymond made it so that whenever the nerf gun fired, it played a sound clip of Emma screaming. You can see and hear that here. Essentially the camera will look around and lock onto a body. After it gets a good lock (about 0.3 seconds) it will then fire. Here are some successful videos of the nerf turret doing its thing. Raymond ended up submitting this project to a hackathon hosted by Theta Delta Chi and he ended up winning first place and he won a PS5. Which was really cool. You can see that Instagram post  here

This past Sunday, I walked out of an early screening of Everything Everywhere All At Once hosted by  MIT Lecture Series Committee (LSC) MIT LSC hosts a lot of very cool early screenings as well as just high quality screenings of movies and projects them in 26-100. I’ve gone to a couple of screenings and events in the past in an effort to see more movies (I watched Fresh with Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones a couple weeks ago and also went to the  Bo Burnham-Jonny Sun Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, were there to do a Q&A event after the screening. LSC provided dinner beforehand as well as popcorn and refreshments which was really great and so many people showed up to watch the movie! As for the movie itself, I sobbed like a little baby throughout the entire thing. I won’t write too, too much about the movie since I think everyone should see it for themselves but this movie truly felt like it came at the right time for me. Everything Everywhere All At Once is a sci-fi action adventure comedy about a Chinese American woman traveling through the multiverse and seeing her other lives. The movie tackles a lot of different ideas, like immigrant mothers and generational trauma, being queer in a traditional Asian family, nihilism and the meaninglessness of life, and finding meaning in a meaningless life. It felt less like a movie and more like an experience. I didn’t feel as if I was watching the movie but the movie was kind of just   to me. It is suffocating and intense and gut-wrenching and funny in the best way possible. It features an interesting take on the multiverse. During the Q&A, the Daniels talked about how they wanted to create a movie that really dug deep into this concept of the multiverse and how multiverses alone destroy narratives, rendering the individual choices and decisions of their characters useless. And it’s true, we see our main character view her other versions of herself and realizes that the decisions she as accumulated in her life have created branches and branches of split lives of herself, and she has ended up in her worst timeline. Though meant to be comedic, I found this sentiment especially resounding, where her alternate-universe husband tells our main character that she is living her worst life possible, giving her endless possibility to become something better and greater. It is only up from here. Not only does the film tackle this difficult idea of multiverses, but also addresses an onslaught of relevant familial issues. It was heartwarming to see not only queer representation in such a big film, but also watch a movie that tackles generational trauma from the perspective of the Asian immigrant mother as opposed to the child. Daniel Kwan touched a little about this in the Q&A, reflecting on his own experiences growing up as the child of immigrant parents. Watching this movie for the first time with his parents felt like a turning point in his relationship with his family. Something healing. And yes, while it did feel like this movie was doing so much at once, it felt fitting. After all, the movie is quite literally titled  This movie hit me like a fucking truck. I don’t quite know why in particular, but for a while I’ve been questioning my place at MIT and my purpose in what I’m doing and where I want to go and where I see myself. I study and study and work and do all these things but know that at the end of the day nothing will make a difference and I’ve been wrestling with these feelings. What is the point? What is the purpose? and where do I go? And I think this movie felt like an answer to those questions. I’m not sure what that answer was, but it felt like a big turning point in my life for… . In the Q&A after the screening, Daniel Kwan perfectly captured this feeling, saying that he’s been “waiting for a movie to change [his] life.” And I feel like, in a way, this movie has been something I’ve been waiting for a while. It felt like it was finally absolving me of my issues, wrapping me in its chaos and comedy and telling me in a big loud yell “It is okay not to know. It is okay to be nothing. It is okay to just be. Yes, the world is meaningless and nothing matters, but you can find the community and find the people you are willing to be in that nothingness with.” Overall, Everything Everywhere All At Once is a movie that will stick with me, that will haunt me in my bones. For a movie that’s about nothing truly mattering, I felt like I had a purpose or some greater understanding of what the fuck was going on in my life after watching. I highly recommend you give it a watch! The fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed and so visceral and comical, yet perfectly balanced out by the touching moments surrounding family and expectations and relationships. It’ll make you laugh, it’ll make you cry, it’ll make you question your life and your purpose. It is absolutely mind-boggling and absurd and I adored every moment of it.

At MIT Admissions,  our mission  is to recruit, select, and enroll a  diverse good match  for MIT’s unique education and culture. Everything we do in our process is grounded by our goal to find and admit students who will succeed at MIT and  serve the world afterward .  After careful consideration, we have decided to  reinstate our SAT/ACT requirement separate conversation with MIT News today 
explain more ⁠ 01 In addition to the main text of the post, if you see any text highlighted in transparent red, you can hover over it on desktop (or tap, on mobile) to see a related annotation on the right hand side of the post (or inline, on mobile; note that the desktop/mobile UI is triggered by the width of your browser). The annotations are numbered, and repeated as endnotes at the bottom of the blog. We use this feature — which we developed with our designers at <a href="https://upstatement.com/">Upstatement</a> — to add additional commentary, evidence, and background information throughout the post, in case readers want to learn more than we could reasonably fit into the main body of text while still keeping it comprehensible. When we initially  suspended our testing requirement  due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I wrote:  This was not a decision we made lightly. Our reliance on these tests is outcome-driven and applicant-oriented:  we don’t value scores for their own sake , but only to the extent that they help us make better decisions for our students, which they do. We regularly research the outcomes of MIT students and our own admissions criteria to ensure we make good decisions for the right reasons, and we consistently find that considering performance on the SAT/ACT, particularly the math section, substantially improves the predictive validity of our decisions with respect to subsequent student success at the Institute. Within our office, we have a dedicated research and analysis team that continuously studies our processes, outcomes, and criteria to make sure we remain  mission-driven  and  student-centered . During the pandemic, we redoubled our efforts to understand how we can best evaluate academic readiness for all students, particularly those most impacted by its attendant disruptions. To briefly summarize a great deal of careful research:   our ability to
 
accurately predict student academic success at MIT ⁠ 02 Our research shows this predictive validity holds even when you control for socioeconomic factors that correlate with testing. It also shows that good grades in high school do not themselves necessarily translate to academic success at MIT if you cannot account for testing. Of course, we can never be <b>fully</b> certain how any given applicant will do: we're predicting the development of people, not the movement of planets, and people always surprise you. However, our research does help us establish bands of confidence that hold true <em>in the aggregate</em>, while allowing us, as admissions officers, to exercise individual contextual discretion in each case. The word 'significantly' in this bullet point is accurate both statistically and idiomatically. significantly  improved by considering standardized testing — especially in mathematics — alongside other factors  some  standardized exams besides the SAT/ACT  can  help us evaluate readiness, but access to these other exams is generally
 
more socioeconomically restricted ⁠ 03 Examples of these other exams include the AP/IB exams, international curricula like the IGCSEs, or the mathematical olympiads. However, access to these examinations generally depend on what is offered at your high school, and there are <a href="https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Inequities-in-Advanced-Coursework-Whats-Driving-Them-and-What-Leaders-Can-Do-January-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immense disparities between schools in this regard</a>, and even <a href="https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Francis_Counselors_BEJEAP_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within schools for certain students</a>.  the SAT/ACT as a result, not having SATs/ACT scores to consider tends to
 
raise socioeconomic barriers to demonstrating readiness for our education, ⁠ 04 Although our analysis is specific to MIT, our findings directionally align with <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/424154/sttf-report-rev-2-14-20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a major study conducted by the University of California’s Standardized Testing Task Force</a>, which found that including SAT/ACT scores predicted undergraduate performance better than grades alone, and also helped admissions officers identify well-prepared students from less-advantaged backgrounds. It is also consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/act-sat-for-all-a-cheap-effective-way-to-narrow-income-gaps-in-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent research compiled by education researcher Susan Dynarski</a> that shows standardized testing can be an effective way to identify talented disadvantaged students who would otherwise go unrecognized. Of course, there may be institutions for whom this research does not hold true, but the findings are very robust for MIT, and have been for many, many years. Our research can’t explain  why  these tests are so predictive of academic preparedness for MIT, but we believe it is likely related to the centrality of mathematics — and mathematics examinations — in our education. All MIT students, regardless of intended major,  must pass two semesters of calculus, plus two semesters of calculus-based physics,
 
as part of our  General Institute Requirements ⁠ 05 The GIRs are both a defining strength of the MIT education, and also the functional constraint on access to it. Because all MIT undergraduates, no matter their major, must pass challenging classes in calculus, physics, biology, and chemistry — as well as a rigorous humanistic and communication requirement — we believe we can only responsibly admit students who are prepared to do all of that work, across all of those fields, at their time of entry to MIT. It is perhaps worth noting that the GIRs are also the most basic point of entry in each of these fields: MIT does not offer any remedial math classes ‘below’ the level of <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single-variable calculus</a>, for example, or physics courses ‘below’ <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classical mechanics</a>, so students have to be ready to perform at that level and pace when they arrive. 
long, challenging final exams that students must pass ⁠ 06 In addition to final exams in the GIRs, first-year students also usually take several other exams. Most students also must take a separate math diagnostic test for physics placement as soon as they arrive on campus, and placement out of MIT classes is mostly granted through our <a href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/advanced-standing-exams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Standing Exams</a>, rather than by AP or transfer credit. As a member of our faculty once observed to me, “the first year at MIT is often a series of high-stakes math tests.” Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that the SAT/ACT are predictive (indeed, it would be more surprising if they weren’t). 
proceed with their education. ⁠ 07 The vast majority of MIT students will then go on to take many additional quantitative and analytical courses within their program of study, even if they are not majoring in science or engineering. For example, an <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/economics-course-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">economics degree</a> at MIT <em>requires</em> at least one course in econometrics, and a <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/philosophy-course-24-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy degree</a> at MIT usually entails courses in set theory, modal logic, and/or infinities and paradox). To a degree unlike almost any other institution, MIT is a place where <em>every</em> student will have to do a <em>lot</em> of math (and math tests). 
as soon as they arrive. ⁠ 08 A reader might reasonably ask: well, can’t MIT do more to bring students up to speed? Why are you most focused on students who you think can <b>already</b> do well, and not those who <b>could</b>, if they had more help? To be clear, <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/meltdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyone will find MIT a challenge</a>, no matter how well-prepared. And MIT <em>does</em> provide support for its students through its excellent <a href="https://ome.mit.edu/programs/talented-scholars-resource-room-tsr2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutoring programs</a>, <a href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/first-generation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affinity networks</a>, <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support services</a>, <a href="http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/academic-programs/freshman-year/#concoursetext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternative curricula</a>, <a href="https://ome.mit.edu/programs/interphase-edge-empowering-discovery-gateway-excellence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer programs</a>, and so on. However, our research shows there is a degree of preparation below which a student, <em>even with those resources</em>, is unlikely to be able to succeed. We feel it is our responsibility to make those difficult calls, and only admit a student to MIT if they are ready to undertake its education at this point in their educational development. Meanwhile, we continue to collaborate with <a href="https://ogcr.mit.edu/k12education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our partners in K-12 education</a> to try and help interrupt persistent, intergenerational inequality where and how we can. To be clear, performance on standardized tests is not the central focus of our  holistic admissions process . We do  not prefer people with perfect scores ; indeed,  despite what some people infer from our statistics at all  beyond the point where preparedness has been established as part of a multifactor analysis. Nor are strong scores themselves sufficient: our research shows students  also  need to do well in high school  and  have a strong  match for MIT , including the resilience to rebound from its challenges, and the initiative to make use of its resources. That’s why we don’t select students solely on how well they score on the tests, but only consider scores to the extent they
 
help us feel more confident about an applicant’s preparedness ⁠ 09 It is worth noting that since MIT opened in 1865, and until our public-health driven suspension in 2020, MIT has required some kind of entrance exam to demonstrate mastery of the material required to succeed in our education. As our blogger CJ has <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/course-catalogs-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a>, at the founding, applicants were required to show competence in "arithmetic, algebra, geometry, English grammar, geography, and the rudiments of French" on an entrance examination designed and administered by the Institute. These exams allow applicants to show their ability to succeed at MIT regardless of what was available at the high school they may have attended, and eventually transitioned to similar exams offered by the College Board by the 1940s, which evolved over time into the simpler set of tests we have today. So there is a long history of MIT tailoring its admissions requirements to pragmatic assessments of what is required to do well at the Institute. At the same time, standardized tests also
 
help us identify academically prepared, socioeconomically disadvantaged students who could not otherwise demonstrate readiness ⁠ 10 This may seem like a counterintuitive claim to some, given the widespread understanding that performance on the SAT/ACT is correlated with socioeconomic status. Research indeed shows <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED562860.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">some correlation</a>, but unfortunately, research also shows <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-21/editorial-whats-less-fair-than-the-sat-you-might-be-surprised" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correlations hold for just about every other factor admissions officers can consider</a>, including <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi9031" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">essays</a>, <a href="http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/liufall2013/files/2013/10/New_Perspectives.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grades</a>, <a href="https://edtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Inequities-in-Advanced-Coursework-Whats-Driving-Them-and-What-Leaders-Can-Do-January-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to advanced coursework</a> (as well as <a href="https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Francis_Counselors_BEJEAP_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opportunities to actually take notionally available coursework</a>), and <a href="https://curate.nd.edu/show/zw12z319c9t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letters of recommendations</a>, among others. Meanwhile, research has shown <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137751/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widespread testing <em>can</em> identify subaltern students who would be missed by these other measures</a>. Of course, this area of research is complex and contested, but the main point is that for every aspect of every application, we <em>always</em> have to adjust for context: as one of the papers I linked above notes, "college admission protocols should attend to how social class is...encoded in non-numerical components of applications." Meanwhile, the predictive validity of these tests for MIT, coupled with their ability to identify (some) students who would not otherwise be ‘picked up’ by other indicators, means that we are able to use them to help diversify our class more than if we did not consider them. 
hampered by educational inequalities. ⁠ 11 In general, we think it is important that the MIT education does not simply and unthinkingly reproduce an educational elite who have already had ample access to resources. In our process, we do not give preference to legacies, nor weight to demonstrated interest, nor an advantage to those who apply through our (non-binding and non-restrictive) Early Action process, nor other things that subtly correlate with socioeconomic advantage but are unrelated to a student’s ability to do well at MIT. And when we review applications, we always strive to evaluate each student’s accomplishments in context: we don’t care as much about what a student has done as what they have done <em>relative to what might have been expected,</em> given their resources. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/massachusetts-institute-of-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published in the <em>New York Times</em></a> a few years ago, there is more economic diversity and intergenerational mobility at MIT than at comparable institutions (although not quite as much as at some public institutions that deserve ample credit and recognition for their work); nearly 20 percent of our students are the first-generation in their family to attend college, as I was. We of course have room to do better, and we think the tests will help us continue to improve. 
tests as a tool ⁠ 12 We know they are imperfect tools, of course. Tests can’t measure everything that is important about an applicant’s creativity, curiosity, or drive. But because all of our tools are imperfect, we have to account for all of their imperfections in our process. This is what makes admissions something a skilled human does, and not something amenable to a simple algorithm crunching numbers. Given all these imperfections, might we someday have better tools at our disposal? I hope so. I have supported reform initiatives such as the <a href="https://mastery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastery Transcript</a>, <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/project/reimagining-college-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performance assessments</a>, and <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-first-year-application-for-the-mit-class-of-2026-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schoolhouse.world certifications</a>. For many years, we have allowed students to submit <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/firstyear/portfolios-additional-material/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative portfolios</a> — including our Maker Portfolio for technical creativity — to demonstrate unique interests and aptitudes not necessarily captured in their grades and scores. However, these alternative assessments are not yet widely available to students across the socioeconomic spectrum (relative to the SAT/ACT), and we do not yet have the research that would allow us to substitute them for the tests as a predictor of success at MIT even if they were. We will continue our advocacy and research in these areas, but for now, we find we still need to rely on conventional indicators like grades and scores, at least to some degree. in the service of  our mission, we have helped 
 
improve the diversity of our undergraduate population ⁠ 13 What it means to "improve diversity" is a complex question. As we say in our <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/policies/#diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diversity statement</a>: "How much diversity is necessary to achieve our goals? Every student should feel that ‘there are people like me here’ and ‘there are people different from me here.’ No student should feel isolated; all students should come into contact with members of other groups and experience them as colleagues with valuable ideas and insights." For our purposes here, by "improving diversity" we mean we work to improve the recruitment and enrollment of well-matched and academically prepared students from a range of under-represented populations, including students of color, low-income students, and students who will be the first generation in their family to go to college.. We also value the diversity contributed by our many ‘New Americans’: a majority of MIT students are either immigrants themselves, or the child of at least one immigrant parent, and we believe their <a href="https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/immigration-kind-oxygen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiences and perspectives enhance MIT as well</a>. 
student academic outcomes at MIT have gotten better, ⁠ 14 For example, <a href="https://ir.mit.edu/more-student-data/#retention" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising graduation rates across all demographic groups</a>, and <a href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/fifth-week-flags-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer students receiving fifth week flags</a> or <a href="https://web.mit.edu/acadinfo/cap/endofterm/decisions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="broken_link">otherwise subjected to academic review</a>, just in terms of things we can straightforwardly measure. 
doing both simultaneously. ⁠ 15 In the past, we have publicly described this simultaneity — more diverse, <em>and</em> doing better — as there being no <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/diversity-or-merit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary tradeoff between diversity and merit,</a> as some unfortunately still seem to believe. Of course, in contemporary discussions of educational equity, the entire concept of "merit" — which appears as a keyword in our mission statement — has been critiqued as merely laundering intergenerational privilege. However, what <em>we</em> mean by "merit" in this context is something like: "someone who we think will do very well at MIT, and in the world afterward, based on what they have done with their opportunities, <em>relative to</em> what we would have expected given those resources." In other words, it is defined <em>pragmatically and contextually</em> for the specific needs of, and goals for, an MIT education, and is not intended to pass universal judgment of who "deserves" or has "earned" our education. Meanwhile, our research suggests the strategic use of testing can help us continue to improve both the diversity of our class and its collective success at MIT. The pandemic has only made this more clear, because classroom work and assessment have been just as disrupted as access to the tests, if not more so, and for longer periods of time, disproportionately affecting the most socioeconomically disadvantaged students. We know that the pandemic’s effects on grades and courses will linger for years, but the tests can give students a more recent opportunity to show that they have made up lost ground. Like all of you, we had hoped that, by now, the pandemic would be behind us. It is not, nor is it clear if or when it will be. However, the
 availability of vaccines for adolescents ⁠ 16 Prospective MIT students should note that all faculty, staff, and enrolled students must be up to date with their Covid-19 vaccines, or have received an exemption from vaccination, in order to work, study, and/or live on campus. “Up to date” in this context means a person has received all recommended Covid-19 vaccines. Additionally, Covid-19 vaccine boosters are required of all eligible MIT employees, faculty, and enrolled students, as well as anyone else who studies, works, or lives on MIT’s campus or who regularly accesses MIT facilities. For more on MIT’s vaccination policies, <a href="https://now.mit.edu/policies/vaccination/">click here</a>.  has reduced the health risks of in-person educational activities, while the
 expansion of the free in-school SAT ⁠ 17 Which is how <a href="https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results#:~:text=remaining%20in%202021.-,SAT%20School%20Day,-SAT%20School%20Day">a majority of students in the United States now take the SAT</a>. forthcoming Digital SAT , have increased opportunities to take the tests. Given the crucial role these tests play in our process, we have — after careful consideration within our office, and with the unanimous support of our  student-faculty advisory committee  — decided to reinstate our SAT/ACT requirement
 
for the foreseeable future. ⁠ 18 We know that this is cutting against the recent trend toward <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2022/01/24/will-test-optional-become-new-normal-admissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test-optional policies</a>. However, for reasons I’ve explained above, the tests greatly help us in our efforts to enroll a diverse and talented class. I say "for the foreseeable future" because we believe this policy is the best way for us to meet our mission given the facts on the ground as they are now, but also to acknowledge — as the pandemic has repeatedly taught us — that sometimes those facts change. We will continue to research all of our practices and outcomes to make sure we remain centered on our mission, and not the tests themselves. For example, a few years ago <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-special-announcement-about-sat-subject-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we made the decision to stop considering the SAT Subject tests in our process</a>. As I wrote at the time, we did this because our research showed the marginal additional benefit of the subject tests (in terms of predicting academic outcomes) was no longer worth the costs of access in terms of recruiting and enrolling our desired class (as long as we could still consider the SAT/ACT), because exogenous patterns of test-taking had changed. This hopefully helps explain how we think about our research informing our practice, guided by our values. We are reinstating our requirement, rather than adopting a more flexible policy, to be transparent and equitable in our expectations. Our concern is that, without the compelling clarity of a requirement, some well-prepared applicants won’t take the tests, and
 
we won’t have enough information to be confident in their academic readiness ⁠ 19 Again, our research suggests this is most true for our most disadvantaged applicants, whose other educational opportunities have been most disrupted by the effects of the pandemic. 
more equitable ⁠ 20 By requiring everyone submit the tests, we reduce the socioeconomic advantage of students who have access to better advising about strategic score disclosure, while ensuring that students with less access to such advising are not left anxiously in the dark, wondering what they should do. This dynamic is why, when <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-special-announcement-about-sat-subject-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we stopped considering the SAT Subject Tests</a>, we did not move to a test-optional policy, but instead adopted what is sometimes called a "test-free" policy, where we do not solicit them from applicants, and proactively remove them from view when self-reported. So, if you are applying to MIT in the future, we will normally expect you to submit an SAT or ACT score. If you are unable to take the tests  because of a disaster or disruption , because the SAT/ACTs
 
are (still) unavailable or unsafe to take ⁠ 21 In addition to disruptions caused by natural disasters, political instability, and military conflicts, we know the pandemic continues, and not everyone around the world has been able to be vaccinated yet, or is able to mount an adequate immune response. <em>Please do not endanger yourself or your family to sit for these exams. </em>If you have to have to ask yourself whether or not you are in danger, exercise the precautionary principle and assume the answer is yes. 
rigorously assessing other academic aspects of your application. ⁠ 22 Based on our research from the pandemic, the most important components to demonstrate academic readiness in the absence of SAT/ACT scores would be other standardized exams, such as the AP/IB/AICE exams in the United States, or (inter)national examinations such as the IGCSE, CAPE, WASSCE, KCSE, French Baccalaureate, Abitur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_Olympiad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Science Olympiads</a>, and so on abroad. I understand that this announcement may dismay some readers for whom the tests can be a source of stress. As someone whose daughters went through the college admissions process over the last few years, I
 
saw firsthand ⁠ 23 It was difficult enough for them, and they had a Dean of Admissions for a dad! 
anxiety they can cause. ⁠ 24 Not only a stress but a burden — another thing to study for, and schedule, and do. We try to remove barriers from applicants wherever we can, and think of the tests as a bridge for reasons I described above, but of course, <a href="https://www.imtfi.uci.edu/files/articles/Star.pdf">infrastructures are relational:</a> a bridge <em>functions as</em> a barrier if you can’t cross it. For that reason, we continue to work with the College Board, Khan Academy’s tutoring team, and other agencies and institutions to reduce burdens, and pave paths, as much as possible from our position. To those of you who feel this way I say:  you are not your test scores, and for that matter, you are also not your MIT application, either . You are  infinitely more  than either of these narrow constructs could ever capture. When we talk about evaluating academic readiness for MIT, that doesn’t mean we are measuring your academic potential, or intrinsic worth as a human. It only means that we are confident you, at this specific moment in your educational trajectory, can do well in the kind of hard math and science tests demanded by our unusual education. Every year, we
 
turn down ⁠ 25 Sometimes we do not admit students because we are concerned about their academic preparation, or match for MIT; given the strength of our applicant pool, though, it is more often the case we think they <b>can</b> do the work, but we simply don't have the space to admit all the well-qualified and well-matched students who apply. thrive elsewhere . Remember: your MIT decision is  never  about us passing judgment on  you as a person , just about us contingently selecting a particular  team of people , at a particular point in time, to take on the challenge of MIT, together.  We are announcing this decision now to give the prospective Class of 2027 (and beyond) time to  prepare for their exams  In the meantime, we will continue to welcome the newly admitted Class of 2026 —  especially at our first in-person  Campus Preview Weekend #access #act #diversity #equity #process #SAT #tests

And then I asked him, “What’s the most unexpected thing about adulthood?” “Good or bad?” he said. “Either, I guess.” Silence stretched between us. “Probably,” he whispered, “that I’ve started to think like an old person.” On Saturday the Puzzle Club ran an event where we solved puzzles from an issue of  P&A Magazine On Sunday night I ate dinner at Dumpling House with some friends. It’s only been a month since I last went to Dumpling House. I was meeting up with a group walking from the west side of campus, so with me living in the east side, we were going to meet along Mass Ave. I arrived at Mass Ave shortly before finding out they had just left, fifteen minutes after I was initially told they’d leave. I waited on some random sidewalk for another fifteen minutes, before we continued walking. On Monday morning I got a haircut from Kendall Barbers. George, my barber, mused about how long my hair’s grown. I told him that my last haircut probably happened last summer. He laughed. He was apologetic for taking so long to cut my hair, when it had only been half an hour. “Think like an old person?” I asked. “What do you mean?” “Well,” he said, “in college, I always thought of hours and days. There’s hour, hour, hour, and sometimes, day, day, day.” “But now?” “Now it’s week, week, week.” He paused. “Month, month, month. Quarter after quarter after quarter. It reminds me of a conversation I had at my first internship.” “Your first internship? That must’ve been years ago,” I said. “I hadn’t even turned eighteen, at the time. I was talking to a coworker who was over fifty.” He stared wistfully at the ceiling. “She talked about years. How there were things that she did every two years, every four years. And I haven’t even experienced eighteen years.” On Monday I had an appointment with MIT Medical, to get the irregular vertigo I’ve had checked out. The last time I’ve been to a physician of any sorts had been before I came to MIT, three years ago. The nurse referred me to an ear-nose-throat specialist. On Tuesday I called the nearest ENT clinic to set up an appointment. It took fifteen minutes to relay all my demographic information over the phone. The first open slot was in six weeks. On Wednesday I had an appointment with my therapist. The depressive symptoms haven’t come up  for months now On Thursday I got around to doing an experiment I’ve always wanted to try: be blindfolded for 24 hours,  inspired by a blog post I read “In college, everything has an end. You take a class, and it ends. The research project you’re working on has an end. The semester has an end. College has an end. Work isn’t like that. There’s always more work. “In college, you have breaks. Spring break, summer break, winter break, holiday, holiday, holiday. You know when the breaks will come, when finals will come, when you can relax and cram. “Work isn’t like that. I don’t know when I can take a break, or when the stress will come.” On Friday a friend who was  once an upperclassman He talked about his work, and for that I was grateful; I wanted to hear about it. I wanted to know more about what it was like, being alone in a world outside the auspices of MIT. He confessed that not much was different. That he sometimes felt like a child acting out the role of someone twice his age. I asked him about his schedule. As he didn’t have strict hours, how did he structure his work days? He said that he tries to not have anything scheduled in the evenings and weekends. He said that the nature of the job, though, meant that he blocked out mornings or afternoons. That his calendar was blocked not by hours, but by days. Despite all this, he was happy with his work. He enjoyed being respected by others. He had glowing praise for his coworkers, and thought of them as cool people. He talked about how much he’d been learning, about programming and management, and all sorts of things he never thought he would learn. And then I asked him, “What’s the most unexpected thing about adulthood?” Yesterday, the Filipino Students Association held a karaoke event. Last night, some friends from a summer camp I went to were in town, and we stayed up until 3 AM playing board games. Today, I was supposed to do more work, but I lost track of time reading  A Practical Guide to Evil Six hours. Six whole hours. That felt like a lot of time. But in the grand scheme of things,  maybe it wasn’t a lot of time And maybe one could have said that of spring break. Nine days. Nine whole days. That felt like a lot of time. But in the grand scheme of things, maybe it wasn’t a lot of time. What if I wanted it to be a lot of time? What if I   want to see my hours and days fade to weeks and months or years and decades? Is six hours a lot of time? Nine days? A summer? Four years? He broke the minute of silence with a question. “Why do you ask?” he said. “I assume you’ve talked to other people about these kinds of things—adulthood, working, growing up.” “I haven’t,” I said. “You’re the only person with an actual job that I talked to about these things.” “Why ask me?” he asked. “I dunno. I think I see myself in you. I think I’m trying to decide— “Maybe,” my psychiatrist said, “this behavior comes from that same avoidance, of thinking about the future. And so you avoid thinking about next summer, or next semester, or what happens after you graduate. “Which is understandable. You’re worried about what will happen with  all these things you care about He looked at me, waiting for a response. “Yeah,” I croaked, holding back tears. “Yeah, that’s it. Part of me is scared that the real world won’t be anywhere near as good as it is for me now. That things are going   well for me, and once I leave MIT, the other shoe will drop. That I’ll end up somewhere feeling alone, and lonely, and sad, and then I’d be right back where I started.” “—whether I want to be an adult.” I said. “Whether you want to be an adult,” he repeated. “As opposed to what? What would you be, then?” “A kid,” I replied. “I’d be a kid forever. I just need to figure out how.”

I’ve written in the past about my love for  Disneyland I went to Disney World with my dad’s side of the family around the age of 3 and remember some vague things about it. I remember staying up til midnight in the timeshare, sleeping next to my aunt and eagerly showing her the time. (I had never stayed up that late before.) I remember walking around Epcot and landing in
 
Japan ⁠ 01 Epcot is a park at Disney World where each area of the park is a different country to showcase that country's culture and cuisine and also the Disney movies that may take place in that region. For this spring break, I spent three days at Disney World (Saturday-Monday), flying into Orlando from Boston on Friday and flying out on Tuesday. I went with three other women in my sorority: Julie T. ’22, Kat T. ’22, and Lulu T. ’22. I originally was very hesitant to go on this trip with them, especially because I wasn’t as close with them as they were with each other, but as I’ve lived in the house, I’ve really gotten close with the seniors that live here and wanted to spend a trip with them before they graduated. Kat is incredibly knowledgeable about all things Disney, having consistently gone to Disney World every year since she was a kid. She was able to book us a really nice resort and set up the tickets and
 
fastpasses ⁠ 02 These are special tickets that you have to reserve in advance that let you use 'lightning lane' for specific rides as opposed to the normal ride. This lightning lane is shorter, faster, and receives priority over the standard ride. You usually only get 3 uses per day but if you pay extra you get unlimited fastpasses. We decided to go hardcore for this trip. On Saturday, we woke up at 5:45 so we could arrive to our first park of the trip, Animal Kingdom. Animal Kingdom is one of the major Disney World parks that is not only an amusement park, but a zoo as well! The park features animals like gorillas, rhinos, elephants, lions, tigers, and more. As an avid animal lover and zoo goer, I was practically bouncing at the thought of seeing animals alongside going on fun rides. We took the shuttle from our hotel at 6:30 and arrived at the park around 6:45, waiting for rope drop at 7. Normally, it opens at 7:30 but guests staying at certified Disney resorts got the privilege to enter at 7am. We lined up with the hundreds of other dedicated Disney goers to wait for “rope drop”, aka when the park officially opens. I didn’t realize how serious people were about Disney, especially since I had grown up with Disneyland so close by I could just show up on a weekday when the park was relatively empty and only have to wait 10-20 minutes for all the major rides I wanted to go on. But Disney World was serious business. As soon as rope drop hit, our group spedwalk to Pandora, the part of the park centered around the major movie motion picture with all the blue people, Avatar. (I’ve…never seen it.) We planned it so that at rope drop we went to the most popular ride of the park since rope drop was going to be the only opportunity where the standard line is usually going to be under 40 minutes. Once the park really opened at 8, all standard lines would jump to 60-200 minute wait times for the major rides. Normally, Expedition Everest, an intense rollercoaster about your expedition up Mount Everest, would be the top ride, but it was closed for maintenance during our trip. We full cleared the park, doing every single ride available to us and seeing every single animal exhibit. I was quite impressed that we were out of the park by 5:30, spending essentially 11 hours at the park. We had walked 11 miles that day. After the park, we went to Disney Springs, an outdoor mall on Disney property, for some dinner. I had these really fucking delicious birria quesadillas that I slurped up in maybe 10 minutes. We walked around to shop and browse the stores, before getting ice cream and brownies at Ghiradelli. We sat and talked for a bit before heading back and sleeping at 1am, prepping for a 7am wake up for the next day. On Saturday, we were still all a little bit exhausted from Animal Kingdom, so we pushed our wake up time to 7:30 and arrived at Hollywood Studios at 8:24, 6 minutes before normal guest rope drop. We essentially wasted an hour but we were all really tired, with Lulu staying behind at the hotel to finish a lab report that was due later that morning and saying she would catch up with us once she finished. With that, we headed to Toy Story land and went to Toy Story Mania since the wait time was only 20 minutes. Toy Story Mania is a 1v1 competitive game where you ride around and play Toy Story themed mini games. Your points are tallied at the end of the ride and compared against the player next to you. I’m an incredibly competitive person (although I’ve mellowed out at MIT since MIT is incredibly non-competitive) so when it comes to competitive games I am always dedicated to winning. Julie and I sat next to each other for the ride and I did not blink once during the entire ride. Despite this, I only won over Julie by 10k points, which was not super duper high. But I was happy regardless! We then headed over to one of the major rides for this park, the Rockin’ Rollercoaster. It’s an Aerosmith (yeah I’m just as confused as you are) themed rollercoaster that features a loopty loop and lots of fast twists and turns. I love rollercoasters, but I usually get a little nervous before them. I’m not sure why. I think it’s a fear of vomiting on one. Granted, I’ve never vomited after riding a ride, but I think the prospect of it is enough to give me anxiety. We waited 100 minutes for this ride. We figured that we could wait since Lulu wouldn’t be arriving until around 12. But just as we were next to go on the ride, the ride literally shut down. Like it broke. Which also terrified me because what the fuck what do you do if you’re in the middle of the upside down part and the ride just fucking breaks??? Regardless, we just went somewhere else until Lulu came and then headed to Smuggler’s Run, a Star Wars themed ride where you have to smuggle a delivery to a buyer in the Star Wars universe. Now, I’m not a huge Star Wars nerd, but my cousin Miguel is so I definitely know a few things about Star Wars. And let me tell you, my jaw was on the fucking floor. I was absolutely blown away by how well the Star Wars section of the park was designed. When I saw the Millennium Falcon in person, I think I almost cried. There were like no words to describe how excited I was just to exist not only in this Star Wars section of the park, but just the entire park itself. We met up with Julie’s boyfriend, Kevin, at Disney World as well and he tagged along with us for some rides and shows, like the Indiana Jones Stunt Showcase, Star Tours, and the Beauty and the Beast theatre show. Toward the end of the night, it was evident that people were really tired and so we didn’t stay too, too long. Julie, Lulu, and I were able to go back to Rockin’ Rollercoaster thirty minutes before closing. I was extremely anxious to go on it because we had eaten dinner thirty minutes before and I was once again terrified I was going to vomit. I have severe anxiety about vomiting, it’s actually a problem I should look into fixing. I warned Julie and Lulu about this in advance so they could talk me down from it and just rationally explain that I was, in fact, not going to vomit. And of course, I did not. I had a great time on the rollercoaster and absolutely loved it. The next morning, Kat and I woke up feeling like dogshit. I got sick the Wednesday right before we left for Orlando and thought it would be enough time for me to get better, but I just ended up walking around the park with a slight cough and congestion. I also lost my voice on Saturday so I essentially spent the entire Orlando trip mute, teaching Julie, Lulu, and Kat the small amount of American Sign Language I knew to communicate effectively with them. Kat got heatstroke from the day before and so she was not having a good time and we made the executive decision to nix our trip to Epcot. I was absolutely devastated not to go. I’m not sure why, but I think this trip really did feel magical to me and it felt like such a bummer not to go to probably one of the most magical parks of them all, Epcot. But I just remember it feeling like such an incredible blow when I realized we wouldn’t be able to go. I was sick and I was tired and cranky because I was then also canceling my second portion of the trip, Puerto Rico. All of us were supposed to meet up with the rest of the DPhiE people in Puerto Rico and stay there from Tuesday to Monday. I just felt like all my spring break plans were crumbling, especially because I had so much riding on this trip. The past few weeks before break had been incredibly shitty for me. I quit the leadership team of my sorority because it was running so poorly and I had lost faith in the president to improve the conditions and that had essentially tanked my physical and mental health. The moment I quit the team, my body kind of gave up and I became bed-ridden, coughing and sneezing and feeling ill. It’s so interesting how closely the mind and body are linked, where copious amounts of stress can really deplete your strength, despite there not being any visible physical strain. As a result of all of this, I was really looking forward to a trip that revitalized and rejuvenated my love for, I don’t know, existence. And Disney World really felt like the answer to that. The day wasn’t all bad though. Once I got through the initial shock of having to cut out Epcot and Puerto Rico from my trip, Kat and I watched the entirety of Fleabag, a famous Amazon Prime show that is like a gut punch and a hug wrapped in 2 seasons. Kat and her family were also able to not only refund us for our Epcot tickets, but still somehow got us free entry for Epcot that day as well as four park hopper tickets for the future. We lounged about until around 8:30 where we felt somewhat okay enough to go to Epcot. I was absolutely BUZZING at this point. We walked into the park right as the Epcot water light show started and I was awestruck. I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen, watching as lights danced across the water and the Disney music played loudly through the park and fireworks boomed and burst above me and I just. I started crying. I don’t know why, I don’t know what, but I just felt tears well at the corners and start falling. I felt human again. And I know it’s silly because Disney is incredibly capitalistic and makes a profit off of children’s happiness and joy, but I really couldn’t help myself. This entire trip made me feel like a kid again, something I haven’t felt in a long, long time. But more than that, I was able to be the kid I really, really wanted to be. When I used to go to parks before, I remember being so embarrassed about going on “kiddy” rides or getting excited to take photos with characters. I didn’t allow myself to get excited or scream on rides. I tried so, so hard to maintain this image of myself for some reason. I was so self-conscious of how I would be perceived when I was younger and it dampened the way I went through life, especially at amusement parks. But here, and now, at the age of 20 years old in Disney World, I was finally allowed to be my full, excitable self. I jumped up and down when I walked into the Disney World parks for the first time. I eagerly ran around in circles pointing things out to Julie, Kat, and Lulu. I talked their ear off about random animal facts I knew. I spewed off Star Wars information to them. When I watched the parade, I stood up and flexed my biceps at Mr. Incredible so he would flex them back. As Goofy passed by us on the water boat, I jumped around and screamed for Goofy. I was happily and carelessly myself. And I realized how much I have grown and how much I’ve been able to come into myself. That I can be unabashedly weird and cringey and loud and annoying and still feel comfortable with myself. That I can excitedly jump and holler for Disney characters and still be completely happy and normal. That I am, for the first time, wholly confident and comfortable with who I am. And really, I think that comes from MIT. If there’s anything that MIT has taught me in these past three years, it’s that there is no such thing as weird here. Everyone here is incredibly quirky and unafraid to be passionate about whatever they are passionate for. And that kind of culture and mentality has taught me to do just the same, to really love things openly and love things hard. As I fly back on the plane (I’m actually planning on surprising my mom. I told her I was flying back to ‘home’ but she does not realize that home is Los Angeles and not Boston), I can’t stop crying because I really realize how far I’ve come and how much MIT has helped me grow as a person. Where I have friends like Julie, Kat, and Lulu who will accept and deal with my weird excitement over Disney and my crying and my screaming and my poor attempts at ASL. And I am happy. I am so, so happy. This trip really showed me how far I’ve come and how proud I am of the person I am now. It feels bittersweet, knowing how good this trip is but realizing that now my weeks with the seniors are really limited. They took such good care of me during this trip despite not knowing me as well as they knew each other and I really felt loved and taken care of and it makes me so incredibly sad to know that in just a little under two months, they will be graduating. So this post is dedicated to them!!! To Lulu, who gets excited to see Lightning McQueen, whose favorite movie is Cars, who took care of me when I was sick and went to the airport with me at 5 in the morning despite not needing to. To Julie, for dealing with my bad jokes and broken sign language and letting me LARP as her and Kevin’s child as we walked around the parks. And to Kat, who put up with my crying and, despite being sick, still went out to Epcot with us and let me see how beatuiful it is, who planned this entire fucking trip from the ground up and really gave me the best Disney experience I’ve ever had, and for introducing me to Fleabag. :) I love these people to death and I will be lost next year without them, but I know they are going to do great things. And they also can’t get rid of me that easily, I will be flying into whatever city they end up in to bother them. #disney world #yeah yea oo yea healing my inner child. hell yeaaaa

tw: mentions of substance abuse, various diseases, death i have been much more productive over the past few weeks than i usually am. of course there are many reasons for this: i don’t text as much as i used to, i have no classes on tuesdays and thursdays, i’m trying to make progress on 2 research projects so i have no choice but to work a lot, and so on. but i think one other reason that might not be as easy to discern is a change in my relationship with death last november i read a  blog post  where the author documents their friend jack’s descent into heroin addiction and eventual death by overdose. it’s probably one of the saddest things i’ve ever read. on some level i already knew what the post would contain before reading it – i knew it would discuss the jack’s depression and lack of motivation, the cycles of therapy and relapse, the emotional and financial cost to family, and so on. but the most chilling part for me was the acknowledgement that jack might have been acting rationally. we tend to think of drug abusers as destroying their own lives, but sometimes peoples’ lives might actually be structured such that the pleasure from drugs is worth the destruction of everything else, from a strictly rational or utilitarian perspective. as the article puts it, “Jack was painfully aware that his future options were, ‘be a complete loser,’ or ‘be a complete loser who feels really really good for a few hours every day.’ He chose the latter.”  i think this is a possibility that we don’t explicitly acknowledge often enough in portrayals of addicts because it is extremely unsettling to consider, but i also think failure to recognize this might interfere with effectively helping certain kinds of addicts i didn’t think about this very hard for a few months, and then in january i read some articles about the opioid crisis. of course i’d seen many news articles about this subject while growing up in the 2010s, but this was the first time i stopped to think about the meaning of each sentence i was reading. what does it actually mean when experts expect a million americans to die from opioid overdoses in the next decade? it means you recall everything you learned about jack and picture yourself in his shoes and think about how that would feel for both yourself and the people you care about, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times, and then you bundle up those feelings and scale them up by ten times. we are desensitized to aggregate narratives and statistics, but when i stopped to actually think through this exercise it was very overwhelming and i started crying. if you have a few minutes and are in a good place mentally and haven’t done something similar before i’d recommend trying it too anyway, enough about the opioid crisis. in january i was looking for new biology-related projects, so i talked to some anti-aging researchers at mit. then i talked to another undergrad who was looking for new bio research to work on, and they mentioned that they find neurodegenerative disease more motivating to work on than anti-aging. their reasoning was something along the lines of old people dying not being as sad as people forgetting everything and not being able to perform basic actions while still alive this is a sentiment i agree with, in the sense that neurodegeneration does feel much more terrifying to me than death. the problem with achieving emotional relief through mindfulness or introspection or the like is that it assumes many of your highest-level cognitive processes work properly, and these are probably the first ones to go when your brain begins to deteriorate. i wonder what happens when, for instance, someone who has conquered their depression through cognitive-behavioral therapy begins to lose their mind – do they slip back into depression (that would be profoundly sad, given how hard they’d worked to escape)? or maybe they lose so much brain functionality that they can’t be depressed (and would that really be a happier ending)? (by the way, i hope i’m not giving you the impression that i ruminate about this stuff needlessly. i don’t think about these topics very often, and when they come up it’s almost always because they directly affect one of my friends) but anyway, i was looking for projects, and my friend mentioned that, because biology research in poorly-understood areas is so unlikely to succeed, you should focus on problems that you think humanity desperately needs to attempt. that way, you can live with your choices in the event that you fail, since you’ll know that it was necessary for someone to try and fail there. they believe this reasoning applies to deciding to go to grad school as well a month later i was talking to a friend about how, if i knew i’d live a long and healthy life in a politically stable era, maybe it’d make sense to go into an industry like finance for a few years and make as much money as possible and then spend the rest of my life working on whatever i wanted to. of course, the problem is that i don’t know how many of those years i have left, and it seems foolish to take for granted that the number is large, so if there is something i really want to get around to doing during my lifetime then i should already be starting work on something related to it  right now . all this is how i settled on one of my current projects, understanding mental health through web browsing behavior – i don’t expect it to work, but i think it’s a compelling and promising enough idea that someone needs to try it, and i like it a lot so i might as well check it out my friend’s unironic reply to my complaint about career decisions was, “this is the big problem facing young people today: why save for retirement if the world might end before 2040?” . i used to dismiss sentiments like the above, because whenever i heard someone say  “why do _ if the world might end before 2040?”  i thought they really meant  “why do _ if the world  will  end before 2040?” , as a justification for impulsive short-term behavior. and for some people, that is the message they want to convey. but for some other people, asking this is their way of voicing a legitimate question –  think about your current lifestyle and life plans, and then think about the very real chance that you could die or be in poor health by 2040; is there anything you want to change about your life in light of this possibility? so i’ve mentioned substance abuse and neurodegeneration and vague possibilities of early death as different ways by which your life can be derailed. my intent here isn’t to create needless panic or anxiety, but rather to explain how taking the time to consider these things has shifted my perspective six years ago, waitbutwhy famously published a  blog post  estimating that, if you’re done with high school, probably around 90% of the time you will ever spend with your parents has already passed. of course the message extends beyond parent-child relationships; the 90% figure probably applies to many of your friends as well. this post suggests that, for those people, we should remember to treat each of our future interactions with them as precious i think it’s a very touching article, and i also believe that most peoples’ behaviors a month after reading the post are virtually indistinguishable from their behaviors prior to reading it this is not a knock on the post itself, just an observation that most people are reminded about the distant future and then do nothing meaningfully different afterwards. occasionally something prods us awake and we emerge from the dream of having time, and then we promptly return to sleep. i think this cycle is one of the major impediments to deliberate personal change in  hell yeah or no , the author suggests that every time you have the choice to take on a new commitment, you should accept it if the commitment is something that elicits a  hell yeah  reaction within you, and otherwise you should decline it. their argument is basically that we accept too many mediocre roles which occupy our schedules, and as a result we don’t have time to pursue truly exciting opportunities when they come up. when i first read this back in december, i agreed with the author’s point but found it impractical or impossible to implement. it’s analogous to  marie kondo’s advice  in  the life-changing magic of tidying up  that you should throw out all your possessions which don’t “spark joy” – very appealing as a theory, very difficult to practice the problem, i think, is that  hell yeah or no  is fundamentally an argument about the scarcity of time, and aversion to thinking about negative outcomes like severe illness or car accidents or civil war was giving me the illusion of infinite time. i’m not suggesting the right thing to do is to obsess over these things – most of them are out of my control anyway, so my goal is simply to accept that the risk from these events is significant, and to not forget that they exist this is the backdrop in which i have been thinking about work and people and everything else. the acute awareness that  there is no time left  means that i have been looking for what i love about each of the things i choose to spend time on and throwing out the activities for which nothing comes to mind. this is the context through which i have found focus in longer work hours and more meaningful social connection and more consistent fulfillment. it is not saddening, it is not frightening, it is not anxiety-inducing; it is freeing, it is empowering, it is the closest i have ever gotten to truly understanding  hell yeah or no

I’m taking three classes this semester. That’s 36 units — two technicals and a CI-H, a writing intensive humanities class. It’s a perfectly legal and okay amount of classes to take, and it means that my schedule has a lot more free time for me to do other things and really focus on doing well in school. It’s a lot of free time for me to be a tryhard. For my technicals, I’m taking 6.006, Intro to Algorithms, and 5.601/5.602, Thermodynamics and Kinetics. They’re both notoriously hard classes. I’ve heard nightmarish stories about 6.006 from my friends and fellow bloggers, and nothing really could’ve prepared me for the reality of it. It’s a genuine timesuck. Every pset takes me ages to complete, anywhere from 8-12 hours a week. None of it really comes naturally to me, and I have to work my ass off just to keep my head above the water. 5.601 is more or less the same. Apparently it was even worse last semester, to the point where when I was talking to friends about the classes I was planning to take, they vehemently warned me against ever taking it in the fall. I think the course staff realized that, though; they stopped offering 5.60 which is the full semester course and they’re only offering the half semester ones now, which I guess helps to save people’s grades a little more. Given the difficulty of my technicals, for a while there, I was going to every single office hour offered, two recitation sections for one class, and I signed up for like four different tutoring services. So all of the free time I had from not taking a fourth class went into tryharding 6.006 and 5.601. Daniel tried to convince me to take 5.12 (Organic Chemistry) with him except on listener, which means I don’t actually have to do the work for the class, I can just tune in to lectures and access course materials and stuff. I thought this would be a great idea because I’m planning on taking it next semester and I wanted to be a little more prepared, because 5.12 is also very difficult, but I went to two lectures before I stopped because I needed that extra time to pour into my technicals. I was like, having the most horrible week of my life and I thought I was going a little crazy so I was like sorry dude, I’m not showing up anymore. And it just makes me wonder how I could ever survive 48 units now, because it feels like these classes will continue getting harder and harder, and I’m uncertain if my ability to keep up will grow along with them. What really makes me feel worse is that I also dropped my UROP, and I dropped helping out at Science Olympiad over IAP, just because I really felt like I couldn’t keep up with it. It feels like I’m a quitter. I’m not doing any of the extracurriculars I used to be really passionate about in high school — which mostly consisted of Science Olympiad and journalism. Like, in terms of journalism, I joined The Tech for two weeks before deciding not to continue with it, which is a bummer considering how when I got into MIT, I texted my friend for hours gushing about how badly I wanted to write for it. At least I’m still doing Tech Callers and I’ve been consistently fulfilling my shift requirements every week. The perks of working here are pretty great. I get a free movie ticket for every month of perfect attendance. What am I doing? It doesn’t feel like I’m doing much at all, but I’m also doing so much at the same time. How is that even possible? And that’s not even considering all of the weird social stuff I’ve been trying to navigate this semester, and also juggling my mental and physical health. I’m just  existing But there’s this restless, panicked animal in me saying that I should be doing more, more, more, more, more, applying to more internships or doing more extracurriculars or … Just more than I can handle, but what if I’m just lying to myself and I actually can handle it? What if I’m just being lazy? What if– Midterm season rolled around. Well, it feels more like it steamrolled me into a human pancake. Even though I was trying so hard, I didn’t see my effort reflected in my exam grades. Which is fine! One round of bad midterms won’t kill me. I still have the rest of the semester. Still, the questions remain: am I doing enough? Am I doing too little? What is enough and too little? I’ve been spending a lot of time with friends individually, but a lot less time just hanging out with my hall in the lounges. There’s a variety of reasons for that, but it makes me a little sad. I feel like I keep entering really strong defined groups that disintegrate a bit and then I go back to being a floater. I was a floater in high school. I still feel like one in college, but maybe a little less lonely than high school me. I have a pretty good support system and I have friends I can reach out to. And people probably think more highly of me in college than they did in high school. I guess friendships ebb and flow, wax and wane. That’s a key realization. Another one is that good relationships require lots of care and cultivation, and I’m still trying to figure out how to keep track of them all, but I also am trying to learn that it’s okay if something ends because they don’t have to be permanent. I drafted most of this blog in early-mid February and I left it here for a month because I got so caught up in my tryharding that I couldn’t finish it. Maybe that’s why this post feels a little disorganized. Revisiting, most of my sentiments remain the same. I still feel a little lost and confused and like I should be doing more. But I’m doing exactly as much as I can handle. I think I just need to come to terms with the fact that some people can handle more and some people can handle less and I’m probably the latter category but that’s okay. Because it’ll be okay. I’m really hoping it will be okay.

By  Fatima ’25 i have been away from home for weeks before and never felt homesick. looking back, that was probably because the excitement of being at a new place never got replaced with the overwhelming realization of being at that new place before that of leaving the new place. after all, i had only been away from home for weeks. before coming here, when someone would ask if i’d miss home, i wouldn’t think twice before saying no. i couldn’t be seen as weak, or i wouldn’t deserve coming. i wouldn’t deserve being at one place when my heart so overwhelmingly ached for another.  as fall semester progressed, i missed home. a lot. to the point where ‘i just wanna go home’ was probably my most-said sentence. it sounds so dumb that i couldn’t identify what it was but really it was almost halfway through fall when i realized that it was homesickness.  homesickness. that being away from home is so difficult for me that it physically aches. that it is difficult to focus on anything. or enjoy the things that i truly, genuinely love.  just acknowledging that i was homesick changed a lot of things for me. my roommate also had been feeling homesick and realizing what it was and that we had been going through similar things made it easier to talk about it and easier to go through it.  still i didn’t feel anything for

i’ve known for a while that i’m a pretty awful conversationalist. my strengths in conversations are listening and asking questions, but when people ask me questions i often pause for a while to think before giving a badly formed answer. for the longest time i wondered if this was because i think more slowly when under social pressure or if the right way to answer questions is to just go with your initial instinct instead of trying to actually come up with the most accurate answer on the spot. there’s probably some truth to both of those explanations, but i think another relevant factor might be that the presence of other people forces me to think at a higher level of rigor than i’m used to the other day i called a stranger on twitter because they tweeted saying they were looking to meet 100 new people online (i ended up being number 42/100). they mentioned that they like skiing because it forces them to confront reality – it’s easy to theorize about what you would do in certain situations or how your body works or how you respond to specific emotions, but most of your theorizing will be wildly inaccurate and the only way to really understand your behavior in a given setting is to experience that setting i liked that comment a lot, and i think i’ve definitely been guilty of excessive theorizing quite often (of course this entire post is just me theorizing some more, but i hope you can bear with me for a bit), as are many of my friends. there are a variety of reasons for this: for one, theorizing is a natural human behavior in the same vein as anxiety; in addition, there’s definitely a correlation between intelligence and overthinking, and people here are pretty smart but i wonder if this habit of excessive theorization can also explain why i am slower in conversations? as in, i find it very easy to think and form words when i’m by myself and only need to confront my internal headspace, but when i’m in a conversation the other person is constantly providing signals and so my thoughts must conform to both my internal headspace as well as the perspective they are communicating. for example, when you’re by yourself it’s very easy to convince yourself that doritos are the best snacks without thinking very hard about it, but when you’re in a conversation and someone is telling you about their experiences with doritos and other snacks it’s much harder to come up with the right things to say because you now have to match what they’ve told you people often think i am smart because i think a lot and can solve a lot of math problems, but none of these are actually indicative of the kind of intelligence i want to have – i want the ability to adapt rapidly and accurately to whatever real life throws at me, in the way that exceptional conversationalists can quickly come up with things to say that are relevant and true and meaningful, or in the way that lebron james understands and responds to new basketball plays in fractions of a second. it turns out the kind of intellect i have doesn’t help with this much – thinking a lot doesn’t really matter if all the thoughts are squarely from your perspective and generally of an abstract nature, and you can get pretty far on math just by reading a lot and attacking problems the way you expect them to be solved without truly communicating interactively with the problems so i’ve been trying to cut down on excessive ungrounded speculation. i don’t think this means i think less nowadays, just that i try to keep my thoughts closer to relevance. i try to fill up my time with work and conversations and other actions that force me to engage with reality. i believe the hypothesis that too much ungrounded thinking can worsen mental health, and i believe that any sufficiently meta thought isn’t that useful, and i also believe that  “a person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions” tldr excessive thinking bad, touching grass good

Last week I saw someone screencap my blog post and  post it on /r/ApplyingToCollege I suffer from being interminably on the internet. My parents always yelled at me for spending all day sitting down in front of my laptop, saying it’s bad for my eyes and my back and my body. Coming to MIT gave me an   to be interminably on the internet:  Cambridge weather sucks trudge through snow The first sign that something was going wrong was when I woke up and saw light streaming in from my window. Sunlight peeled my eyelids open, waking me from my sweet respite. Then Leigh K. ’24 knocked on my door, asked if I could water their plants over spring break, and then brought the plants to my room. Now they sit on my glass center table. My mind looked at the leaves. Those green and purple leaves. Why was my mind finding enjoyment in looking at  ? Was it that time of year already? What was going wrong with me? I went outside, and to my horror, it was  . Worse, it was  . Twenty degrees Celsius warm. I was wearing naught by my shirt and shorts and I felt fine.  The weather reminded me of scenes from around  this time, two years ago . And a tree’s now gone, apparently. Look! Look at this tree. It’s right outside Building 66. Look how it has no leaves. Look at all the grass around it. Look at how tempting that grass is to touch. But I resisted. I knew that as soon as I touched the grass, it would lead down a slippery slope. Now look at all these people sitting in the grass near MIT Medical, doing some sort of stretching. What about these two people eating lunch on Hockfield Court? Are they having a good time, on the grass? Who knows? The powerful sunlight was too much for me. I receded into the basements of Stata to shield myself. I then walked to the other side of main campus to go to a class. The lecture hall was empty. Capacity over a hundred, but only a dozen of us were there. Spring break, it seemed, was already beginning in MIT. After class, I headed toward Kresge Lawn with Matthew H. ’25. We walked up the steps to sight bare trees framing a partly cloudy sky, shadows stretching toward our direction. Groups of students lounged in chairs, walked around in the grass, some were even tossing frisbees. I told Matthew that I’d touch some grass. “Strong,” he said, before touching grass himself. “So strong.”

Pi Day is a big deal around our mathematically-minded Institute. Since the blogs were mostly focused on  decisions, To celebrate all the hard work done by the whole office, the whole admissions staff received a same-day delivered  boxed meal kit Clover Food Lab cranberry pies Previous Next Every Pi Day, lots of departments typically have free food with pie, including the  math department Koch Institute Division of Student Life MIT Dining. Meanwhile, the MIT Museum took advantage of the day to  announce new Welcome Center by Twitter user Ned the Sexy Fish Man Many MIT student residences and clubs held Pi Day events as well. For a representative sample of chaos, blogger  Alan these photos and videos from the Next House pie-ing https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/video-1647315983.mp4 and the announcement of the event as sent to the dorm mailing list, also representative of  MIT mailing list culture I really appreciate that I work at a place where busy people still make the time to have unabashedly geeky fun together.

MIT Regular Action admissions decisions for the Class of 2026 are now available in the  application portal . To check your decision, login to the portal and visit your Application Status page. There, you will be able to see your decision by clicking View Update. There are no interim screens, so you should be sure you are prepared to receive your decision before you click View Update.  This past year, inclusive of both Early and Regular Action, 33,796 students applied to join the MIT Class of 2026. This is another record high: about a 2% increase from  last year , with both being well above the pre-pandemic baseline of about 20,000 applications. Nonetheless, our dedicated team carefully considered them all, subjecting them to the  same standard of attentive, empathetic, holistic review , and taking as much time as needed to get the job done right.   Of those 33,796 applicants, we have offered admissions to 1,337 students who will have the opportunity to  climb the mountain that is MIT . They hail from all 50 states, 65 countries, and more than 900 different high schools. Though they all do different things — geology and gardening, rowing and refactoring, proofwriting and pastoralism — they are united by a shared standard of rigorous academics, high character, and a strong match with  MIT’s mission  to use science, technology, and the useful arts to make the world a better place. We can’t wait to welcome them to our campus to join the outstanding undergraduates who already call MIT home. There are also students who may be climbing other mountains, with other fellow mountaineers, next fall. Of the students to whom we do not offer admission today, we have placed a modest number on our  waitlist  and informed the balance that we will not be able to admit them to the Class of 2026. Getting to “meet” so many capable, compassionate students through this process has, as always, left us  bleary-eyed  and reminded us that what we do is  more than a job : it is a privilege and an honor. We are grateful to have walked this short part of  your path  with you.  If you are among the many stellar students to whom we are not offering admission, then all I can remind you is that  success is not always a straight line . That your path isn’t something MIT sets you on, it’s  something you explore yourself . And if you spend the next few years trying to make wherever you are as amazing as you can (as you already are), then  someday you’ll look back on this Pi Day  and realize it all worked out okay. I’m closing comments on this blog post to concentrate conversation in the open threads for admitted, waitlisted, and not admitted students. Answers to frequently asked questions for waitlisted students can be found  here , with more information about next steps to come in early April. Congratulations to the Class of 2026, and best wishes to all of our applicants. No matter where you enroll next fall, please make it a better place. I know you can. I hope you will.

It’s all right. It’s just a small pebble in your path. Just a tiny pebble. The place you want to be is farther than this, right? That’s why it’s ok…you can get up and immediately continue on…” – Guts (actually Kentaro Miura) There were many wonderful applicants to MIT this year, which unfortunately means that we had to turn down some great students. For those of you who fall into this category, this is an open forum for you to talk,  shake it off survive thrive wherever whatever Stove-cook your oatmeal do things that make you happy We understand that this may be a difficult time for you, but we ask that you converse civilly and with the best of intentions, as that is the spirit of our process.

This is, admittedly, a kind of quickly written post, but I wanted to write something about the crisis in Ukraine, and stuff that I’ve been seeing happening on campus as a result of it. As we already know, nearly two weeks ago, the Russian government invaded Ukraine. The invasion has had dramatic results, on families, communities, finances, and more. I don’t have a lot of family or friends in Ukraine or Russia, so I won’t write about that here. You can read more perspectives on Ukrainian students at MIT  here .  Instead, I wanted to highlight just how quickly students began to act. Within a couple of days, mailing lists and discords were made, some for Ukrainian students in particular and some for any student who wanted to help plan events, donate, and support current efforts.  For context, I can comment on just how quickly one project in particular was made, starting with a message in the discord: “What do ppl think about selling string bracelets to raise money? I did this with a group in 2020… and we raised ~$5000 over the next 3 months. I can organize this again if we think it’s a good idea.” The following day, a channel was started labeled #fundraising with a request for people to help in: Making a google form for orders and determining styles Making a drive folder with documents for documenting how orders are taken Making a google sites website to house the forms Figuring out payment information on venmo Organizers had a meeting, made plans to teach people to make bracelets. Eventually this evolved into also making earrings and pins with backings! A logo was made, and then it was dormspammed  out. There was a new discord server, building on the organization of the old one, and a dedicated mailing list for crafters and orders. Within a day, the fundraiser was at over $750, with everyone receiving a simple email in response saying that their order had been received and would be sent in 1-2 weeks. The money earned goes either to the Humanitarian Fund from the National Bank of Ukraine or the Ukrainian Army based on which you selected on the form.  I’ve already bought a couple of bracelets, and I’ll attach some of the designs here: Previous Next I think it’s really cool to see how quickly everything moves at MIT. This is only one of many, many projects and fundraisers being organized (you can find more information  here )! If you’d like to order some bracelets, crochet pins, earrings, or get a surprise delivery the form is here:  https://forms.gle/h6buX7D5hspSUAiz8 . #always many things to do #lots of stuff on campus lately

If you haven’t seen this year’s  pi day announcement video Angela ‘24, Karthik ‘22, Emily ‘22, and I spent who knows how many hours working on it starting from last fall, throughout IAP, and all the way until the day it came out. We (the exact same crew) also created last year’s pi day video, which you can watch  here here I dragged Angela into talking about this year’s video creation process, so without further ado here it is! 1. Storyboarding : soo we sat together and brainstormed how we can get away with having several different art styles   we brainbarfed at each other for a bit and Audrey came up with something good. : lmao i don’t remember if that was me but we chose Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse as our inspiration cuz we really like the animation style and multiple universes would let us do multiple art styles in the same video. and we also liked the idea of how there are so many dimensions to MIT. : what is this work relationship bureaucracy we’re in? we had to be corporate with them [MIT Admissions] and give them a powerpoint before we could proceed with anything. but our bosses sometimes buy us boba so it’s okay here is the title slide of said powerpoint: title slide of our storyboard slideshow Audrey: our boba bureaucrats liked it enough, so “Into the MITverse” it was. For each universe we included some sort of a mood board, so here’s the one for the fungal blob scene. : of course we also had to have a protagonist. did we ever give this person a name? : yea it’s [redacted redacted] : oh wait we probably shouldn’t put that on the Internet. : our boba bureaucrats (Kellen & co.) don’t even know. : yea let’s keep it that way. didn’t Kellen suggest “Stephanie” because it sounded like “step on me”? : Is that any better? : sure. so we went back and forth for a bit trying to decide whether our bebe should be a boy or a girl. we ended up choosing neither and just them androgynous and/or nonbinary. Here are our initial sketches (left: Audrey’s, middle: Angela’s) and our final version (right). : it’s a fusion! : it’s an  interpolation 2a. Animating : Because we’re noobs who have yet to learn how to use prOfeSsioNaL animation software, we drew everything frame by frame in Procreate (again). : we grinded it out :’). wait are you in
 
2.003? ⁠ 01 dynamics and control I : no : ok so my recitation professor never finishes his thoughts, he’d just start a problem and finish with “just trust me” and “easy easy” instead of the solution : ok i’m going to transcribe that : that’s so random though : yea but it fits the vibe Here are some random stills: Previous Next 2b. Angela’s Ambitious Traditional Animation : this part was so cool that it deserves its own section. : this was the part where we conned fancy oil pastels and eventually posca markers : when Angela drew up all the lineart and uploaded them to dropbox, I expected there be maybe 30 or 40 frames. but when I opened the folder I ..,kept scrolling. there were 119 frames!!! why are you such an overachiever Angela ?!! : oh wait I literally remember you saying, “the more frames we have to color the more pans of pastels we can con from them” : we initially thought we’d just ask for two boxes but we ended up getting four boxes of *fancy fancy* pastels. hehe. : yes but the consequences of embezzling pastels was that we actually had to color everything. “we” as in 80% Angela. the sky color changes because we were running out of blue. : the  : fine we were running out of the  : Karthik was our music man again this year. : Karthik is a legitimate genius. We put together a musical moodboard in the form of a spotify playlist : and let Karthik work his music man magic. : “angela turdinos” : yea i’m a little hot pocket full of shit : bless angela’s heart for taking on all the editing : let’s choose an organ I actually have : ok bless angela’s toes. wait that’s not a singular organ. : how about my left lung? it’s probably very large because I don’t have a heart (editor’s note: angela does have a heart, don’t worry about her) : the editing was very fun. lots of late nights jamming to britney :”) : is that how you spell britney? ok yea she only has one ‘t’. But for real, bless all of angela’s vital and vestigial organs, I got to be lazier with my animations and just leave a lot of it to angela’s editing magic. : bless audrey’s spinal cord and nervous system for the editing notes because i’m head empty no thoughts when I’m editing example of said notes: : there’s no way I’m writing 5,000 words about this but I’ll give it a mention:  : Kellen mentioned that we should give
 
Stu Schmill ⁠ 02 Dean of Admissions and Student Financial Services : yea like  : we actually have his number. but we’re so nice; we didn’t do it. we didn’t even include his number in our animation drafts to scare him. : how do we end this blog? #bless angela's left lung #Pi Day
